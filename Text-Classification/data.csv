Sigiriya,Sigiriya Village Hotel,1,Was okay. I Write everything above,The Hotel was okay. The Food was miserable und cold. The waiters didn‘t take the emty  Plates and they were unprofessionel because they laughed so Hard that they were even sitting on the floor.

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,5,Luxury with an amazing view,"The view is the absolute best thing about this hotel. The view and the food. And excellent service.
The view, the food and the excellent service... and the rooftop bar.
And the infinity pool.
OK so this hotel has a lot going for it.

We'd booked in advance and paid a little extra for a (what we interpreted as) better room. We were a little disappointed to discover our family room was on the sub-level. Once we spoke to the reception they understood and installed us into a top floor room with amazing views over Kandy.
The food is great here. Chef will come out and say hello during dinner service. Breakfast is also excellent and swift.
Make sure you get a chance to enjoy the pool. Being on the edge of the world and looking into the busy green city is not to be missed. The pool is small and cute and only a few loungers so you need to be friendly with your fellow guests.
Also make sure to enjoy the evening sunset views from the rooftop bar. The music is good, the barmen are good, the vibe is good. It's just a good time!

Highly recommend this hotel for families and saw many couples enjoying it too.

Make sure you tip the bellboy. He's a good dude.

The rooms have international plugs, AC, minibar, hairdryers etc... the bathrooms have toiletries and everything you need.
Definitely get a tuktuk or taxi as its up a big hill.",Family

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,4,Pleasant stay in Kandy.,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Grand Serendip and a good comfortable stay. 
It was good location to Kandy we happily walked down to Kandy and caught a Tuk Tuk back. We were on a dinner bed and breakfast rate, where the food was good the brownie we had one night was particularly tasty. 
The staff were attentive and the hotel was generally well kept and very pleasant. The smell in our room was very odd though, like a powerful cleaning smell. I’ve never had a problem with room smells before so found this odd! So much so that whilst in the room we had the patio door open and didn’t have any room service the following day to avoid it heightening any more.
Just a note that taxes and service charges are added on to all food and drink!",Couples
Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,5,I advice everyone to come and experience the opportunity,"We stayed 2 nights it was very beautiful experience and stay, amazing view staff and food everything was great.

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,4,Convenient location,"Stayed one night on only; was the 5th property we'd stay in during our tour around Sri Lanka and while lovely was not the best, Reception staff very smiley and polite; restaurant staff seemed quite reserved and didn't interact although we talked to them. Small pool with amazing views but not enough seating around it.  Breakfast was a good selection- buffet style; not huge but more than enough.  Big rooms and loo with a view!

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,4,"Decent Stay, Could Use Some Improvements","Stayed at Grand Serandib Kandy recently, and while it has its charm, it definitely has a few areas that could use some attention.

The location is great, really peaceful, with lovely views of the hills, which makes for a relaxing atmosphere. The staff is friendly and welcoming, but sometimes a bit slow to respond to requests, which can be a little frustrating when you need something quickly.

The room I stayed in was decent, but could use a little updating. It felt a bit dated, and the bathroom had some minor issues, like low water pressure and inconsistent hot water. However, the bed was comfy, and the air conditioning worked well, which is always a plus.

The food was good, though not mind-blowing. It’s solid enough, but I’d suggest stepping up the variety a bit.",Family

Colombo,Mandarina Colombo,1,Frustrating and unpleasant experience,"Frustrating and unpleasant experience staying here during my first visit to Colombo. Hotel is located directly across an active large construction site so is both very noisy and unsightly at the moment and foreseeable future. Communication with staff is inconsistent and difficult. Was told by 2 employees I would have no problem amending my booking and receiving a refund. Had my booking company contact the hotel multiple times to do this and the hotel denied my request to change dates. After expressing my dissatisfaction to the front desk staff regarding the contradicting information I was told a manager would reach out to me. This never happened and they never attempted to speak to me at all. The worst hotel customer service I’ve experienced across multiple continents. The hotel also does not allow even a single guest into the hotel, which was not visible anywhere on the booking or on their own website. I would consider the many other options in the area when planning your trip to Colombo. Not here.",Solo

Colombo,Mandarina Colombo,2,"It used to be great, now not worth it. There are so many better options.","Two of us stayed at this hotel two years ago. It was better than in every way - rooms were cleaner and felt fresher, the service was friendlier etc. I had recommended this hotel to family. We returned to the hotel this weekend, together with relatives who also booked a stay. We stayed in a room for three adults on the 4th floor. It was an oddly configured layout but aside from that the AC units didn’t work - they kept shutting off during the night and then spluttering back to life loudly - so loud that we woke up multiple times in the night every time it restarted. Probably about 8 or 9 times during the night! One of the units was also malfunctioning to the point that it was spraying out a fine mist of water (sounds nicer than it was) so one of our bags On the floor beneath the unit it was damp the whole time until we realised. Our relatives on the 6th floor reported the same issues with their room plus a blocked bathroom sink. On check-out, the staff were perfectly pleasant but didn’t even ask how our stay was. The service this time around was generally lacking. Thankfully we only booked to stay two nights. I won’t return or recommend going forward.",Family
Colombo,Mandarina Colombo,4,Pleasant stay,"Friendly, kind and helpful staff. On arrival our bags were taken for us and we were given a fresh juice. The room was clean and spacious.

Colombo,The Kingsbury Hotel,5,Coming Back!,"The Kingsbury was a really great stay. Staff is very welcoming and attentive, from the doormen to the front desk, waitstaff, and house keeping, staff is very good. We especially enjoyed Avishka’s (hope I spelled his name right!) service. Such a pleasant person with exceptional service. The front desk staff was very accommodating of our strange scheduled stay, as we spent our first and third week in Sri Lanka at this hotel. We are very grateful for the arrangements they made for us. 

My one gripe is that the one time we really wanted to order indoor dining/room service, as I was not feeling well from a long day of being out. It took a long time for the staff to bring up the QR code for me to even order food, and that’s after I had to call a second time 20ish minutes later to see if they’d brought it. By the time I ordered and was told it would be there in 20 minutes, almost an hour and a half passed, in which I was not really hungry by that point. Other than that, I would certainly stay here again and for an extended stay.",Family

We also dined at a couple of the hotel’s restaurants and enjoyed everything we tried. The Churros Café was especially fun—we had some cake and samosas there, and both were fresh and tasty.

Beyond the food, the room itself was very comfortable. The bed was super cozy and the pillows were great too—just the right amount of support. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained, which made the whole stay feel relaxing and easy.

Colombo,The Kingsbury Hotel,2,"Feedback on My Recent Stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka","Dear [Hotel Management/Customer Service Team],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka, from June 11 to June 16, 2025. While I had high expectations based on the hotel's reputation, my experience fell short in several key areas.

Check-In Experience: Upon arrival, the check-in process was relatively smooth; however, I was disappointed to find that the hotel could not accommodate the specific room I had originally opted for. This was my first indication that my stay might not meet my expectations.

Laundry Service Discrepancy: The most significant issue arose during my checkout. I had received a confirmed email outlining the room tariff, which included 4 pieces of laundry per day. Given my 5-night stay, I was entitled to a total of 20 pieces of laundry. Unfortunately, I did not utilize the laundry service during the first three days of my stay. However, on the 4th and 5th days, I submitted 13 pieces and 7 pieces of laundry, respectively.

At checkout, the billing staff initially requested payment for all 20 pieces of laundry. Subsequently, I was informed that I was only eligible for 8 pieces, as the hotel staff claimed that my lack of usage during the first three days limited my entitlement. Despite my attempts to clarify the situation and present the confirmed inclusion in my tariff, the staff remained unyielding and dismissive. As a result, I was compelled to pay for 12 pieces of laundry, amounting to LKR 5139.00, in addition to an extra USD 45 for the inclusion of the laundry service.

Staff Conduct: I must also address the demeanor of the front office staff during this encounter. Their attitude was not only unwelcoming but also hostile, which exacerbated an already frustrating situation. This lack of professionalism is concerning, especially for a hotel of your standing, and it detracts from the overall guest experience.

Conclusion: While Kingsbury Hotel is well-regarded among both local and international guests, my experience has raised concerns about the rigidity of staff policies and the overall guest service. I believe that addressing these issues is crucial not only for the hotel's reputation but also for the positive image of Sri Lanka as a travel destination.

I hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration to improve future guest experiences. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Kaustav Das",Business

Thank you very much!",Couples
Colombo,ME Colombo,4,Great place and a very enjoyable stay. But having second thoughts right now.,"I have been here once before I left Sri Lanka for the UK. So, when I came to Sri Lanka on vacation, I was happy to stay at this hotel during the days I planned to spend in Colombo. The rooms are very nice and clean, and have everything you need. The hotel is located centrally in Colombo and has easy access to all major destinations which is a huge benefit. 

Over a period of 3 weeks, I stayed at the hotel for about 7 nights as I was travelling away from Colombo frequently. The staff was friendly and supportive. Niroshan and Rushani from the front desk were especially very helpful in my encounters with them. I thank them for their kind hospitality. Secondly, the food in the restaurant is also some of the best food I've had. Definitely recommend the room service here. 

One of the only things that I could suggest as an improvement is to have larger water bottles in the room. We ran out of the bottles quite regularly and had to call up housekeeping to refill them multiple times (to which they happily obliged, which is great!) 

All in all, ME Colombo is definitely good value for money. You also get access to a rooftop infinity pool and a bar. I was able to host a couple of my friends at the rooftop bar for a nice cold beer as well. P.S. The view of the Colombo skyline from the rooftop is amazing. You can also get this view with most of their Superior rooms. 

By this point, I was starting to feel like it was home. However, I tried checking in for another time (8th night in 3 weeks if my memory is accurate) but did not have the best experience. Maybe it's my fault that I didn't make a reservation. My plans are always so sudden, so I couldn't manage to book anything before. Regardless, when I arrived at the hotel to try and check in, I was given very conflicting information and potentially treated unfairly. I arrived a little earlier than the check-in time. The receptionist at the time communicated to me that I could get a room a little later once some of the guests check out and the rooms are cleaned. I was happy to wait and even offered my card to finalise the payment. She even said that she will try to get the room arranged for me sooner for an early check-in. At that point, she had to contact the manager to get the authorisation for a special rate that was offered to me since I was planning to come back multiple times during my 6-week stay in Sri Lanka. The manager then came in and checked some things, and suddenly told me that there is no availability. Was it because he didn't want to oblige to the rate I had before when the hotel had low occupancy and it was at high occupancy at the time? Or was it because I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt with flip flops because I drove all the way from Kandy? Or maybe it was a miscommunication and a misunderstanding. Regardless, it didn't feel right to us. Ultimately, we ended up going to a different hotel that we quite enjoyed",Friends
Colombo,ME Colombo,5,A nice getaway,"Loved the hotel very much. Nice and beautiful. Peace and calm in the middle of Colombo. Loved the interior too. 

The rooms were spacious and had all the facilities that you wanted. Everywhere was nice and tidy giving a relaxing vibe. Food was delicious and was presented beautifully.

A very special mention must go to Chef Mark Selvaraj, who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. His personal attention, warm hospitality, and outstanding culinary skills truly stood out. Every meal prepared under his guidance was a delight – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. It’s rare to come across someone who is not only passionate about their craft but also genuinely cares about the guests’ experience.

The facilities are top-notch and ideal for both relaxation and family fun.– beautiful location, great pool, and a relaxing atmosphere. Our kids absolutely loved the large pool and kids’ club – they had a blast while we enjoyed some much-needed relaxation time.

However, I felt that the buffet could use more variety and refinement to match the hotel’s star rating and especially other Cinnamon properties. And it would be better if bathing area in room can be locked from inside when we staying with kids.

Overall, a wonderful family-friendly resort with a perfect setting for a special occasion. We'd gladly return!",None

The location was perfect, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the food was excellent – simply amazing! We felt completely at ease and very well taken care of.

We also had some great conversations with a pool staff member and someone from the marketing team. They shared that they had either visited Switzerland before or had family there, which made the exchange even more enjoyable.

The only downside to our stay was the experience with a young man at the reception. He gave us incorrect information regarding the full-board option and then acted as if it wasn’t a big deal. In general, the reception staff didn’t seem as friendly or welcoming as the rest of the team.",Couples

Bentota,Cinnamon Bentota Beach - Signature Selection,1,Pathetic service. Stay at Taj instead.,"Had the misfortune of having lunch at Ottimo, their Italian restaurant. The service was ridiculously bad. Halfway through the meal, they switched off the AC! We were the only table in the indoor dining area. When I asked for the manager to address this issue, I waited for 30 full minutes for a manager to turn up! 

In fact, I am still waiting for the manager as I’m typing this. Massive contrast to Taj, just next door, where every member of staff waits on us diligently with a smile on their faces. The quality of service here is almost laughable.",Family
Bentota,Cinnamon Bentota Beach - Signature Selection,5,Not only a tour but an exciting journey into architecture!,"We had such an enriching experience during the architecture tour with the lovely Sanduni de Fonseka, Curator of Art and Culture at Cinnamon Beach Hotel by Geoffrey Bawa. You can see her passion beyond her work. It was a pleasure to hear not only the accurate historical and theoretical notions, but also the person behind the architect through his design. We had a very interesting conversation about Sri Lankan architecture, Geoffrey Bawa and Minnette de Silva and she could answer excellently to all our questions with a personal and critical view!

Not to mention the architecture itself: emotions will play a relevant role. Don’t forget to pay attention to all the cleaver and beautiful details! ;)

The culinary team, led by Chef Amila, Chef Nishantha, and Chef Krishantha, consistently delivers incredible dishes. The hotel managed by  Domani and her wonderful staff is always very impressive.

Meal was very pleasant as was the huge breakfast of either a continental or full Sri Lankan meal
Staff have assisted at every opportunity to make our stay outstanding",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,5,Beautiful boutique hotel with the most incredible staff,"This is a very special, beautiful little hotel. We got a lovely welcome, the room was extremely comfortable and quiet and the food delicious. Lovely breakfast and very good choice of meals at lunch and dinner, both western and Asian. 

We spent just 2 nights at this lovely hotel, not knowing when we booked that it would be the special temple of the tooth event, with hundreds and thousands of Sri Lanka people queuing for miles to see the Buddha’s tooth. This event happens once in a generation so the atmosphere in Kandy was incredible. The hotel is very close to the temple complex and the queue was literally right outside.

We were touched when the staff asked us to help prepare meals for the people queuing, we had quite a production line going loading the Dahl, rice and curry into parcels and then it was an absolute privilege to help hand the meals out. Everyone got involved and the owner of the hotel was there with his family. It was an evening that I will never forget.

Thank you so much to all the lovely staff at the 
Radh you are fantastic and we hope to see you again soon.

Kandy,The Radh,2,"Convenient Stay, But Menu Prices Misleading – 34% Extra Charge","Food:
Please be aware that the actual prices charged are significantly higher than those displayed on the menu. Although the menu includes fine print stating ""10% service charge plus applicable government charges apply,"" we were ultimately charged approximately 34% more than the listed prices. This was unexpected and disappointing. On the same day, we dined at another nearby hotel with a similar rating, and no such excessive charges were applied. The discrepancy felt unreasonable and left a negative impression.

Service during the meal was also below expectations. The dishes were served at staggered intervals, and by the time the final item arrived, some children had already finished their meals, making it difficult to share food as intended. Additionally, we had to request table water three times before it was finally provided. Overall, the dining service was unsatisfactory.

Room Service:
The hotel appears to operate a room service system, but no explanation was provided at check-in. We had to leave the room hurriedly around 6:00 PM to attend temple rituals. Upon returning, we discovered that the room had been cleaned in our absence—without any request from us or prior notice. This raised concerns about privacy and a lack of communication.

It is possible that their advanced system may have been triggered accidentally—perhaps by our children touching the wall panel—sending an unintended housekeeping request. However, we were never informed how the system works, which added to the confusion and concern.

Location:
The hotel is centrally located, making it ideal for early morning temple visits. For those planning spiritual or cultural activities, the location is convenient and highly suitable.

Room:
The room was clean and well-presented, meeting general expectations. However, there was a small, easily overlooked step at the bathroom exit, posing a potential tripping hazard. This is a safety concern that should be addressed by hotel management as a priority.",Family
Kandy,The Radh,4,Great location - nice hotel,Great hotel in the heart of Kandy - close to the temple. Good daily breakfast. Service staff helpful and friendly. My room was a good size. The gym wasn’t that good. Everything is an easy walk from the hotel. Parking available right outside the hotel,Solo
Kandy,The Radh,4,A Touch of Luxury Right in the Heart of Kandy,"The Radh Kandy is definitely one of the better boutique hotels I’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka. From the moment you walk in, the place gives off a clean, modern, and well-kept vibe. It's super close to the Temple of the Tooth and other key spots in Kandy, which made exploring the city really convenient.

The room was compact but well-designed, modern decor, comfortable bed, spotless bathroom, and everything worked just like it should. I especially appreciated the attention to detail, like the welcome treats and the high-quality toiletries.

The staff here are polite and professional, and they don’t hover too much, which I liked. The breakfast was impressive, good variety, fresh, and tasty. I didn’t try the spa, but I heard good things from other guests.

Only downside? Parking can be a little tight, and if you’re in a bigger vehicle, the entrance might feel a bit cramped. But overall, it’s a solid place if you're after comfort, location, and good service.",Family
Kandy,The Radh,4,Good central based hotel,"We stayed here 2 nights while visiting Kandy. It has a great location near the temple and lake. We had a room at the back which was of high quality and very quiet. The breakfast was fine with a good choice of local and European dishes. The staff were helpful. 

Would stay here again.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,5,The Best in Customer Care,"I chose the Radh Hotel for its good reviews and convenient location (both are spot on) - but left even more impressed with the extraordinary level of customer care.  

During my stay I happened to have a laundry mishap that was not at all the fault of the Radh - and yet they took the initiative to do everything possible to take care of me.  That included sending out staff to find an almost exact match to a damaged shirt - which they did! (no small feat - an XXL in Sri Lanka!).   

Moreover, the manager in charge (Domani) took the time to pen an extraordinarily kind and personal  note which is definitely a saver.  It was a class act by the team there, and I was so very impressed.

And yet I would have still penned a 5 star review simply based on the day to day customer service at the hotel.  Chamodi, the restaurant manager, was simply wonderful.  A great smile, always a kind word, and   so very helpful.  A great aura every time she greeted me.

I left the Radh very glad that I had stayed there - and I recommend the hotel to anyone staying in Kandy.",Solo
Kandy,The Radh,3,Adequate Hotel / Good Urban Location,"If you want to stay in the city, The Radh is ideally located within walking distance of the sites and shopping area.  It’s a hectic city, and although the hotel is off of Colombo Street, constant construction noise is everywhere.  The staff are nice but not efficient.  Check in was painfully slow and arduous.  Breakfast service was equally slow.  And basic requests sometimes went unmet.  The breakfast was meager and disappointing, particularly considering the wide availability of fruits etc in Sri Lanka.  This hotel can be much better, and perhaps when its construction and expansion is completed, they can move to soft skills and an enhanced breakfast.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,5,Central location,"Brilliantly located hotel in the centre of Kandy  only a few hundred metres from the temple. We only had breakfast in the hotel and this was excellent . There are many local cafes , restaurants and pubs within walking distance. As this hotel is within the vicinity of the temple it doesn’t serve alcohol but there are a myriad of hostelries within a couple of streets. Rooms are extremely well appointed and we had a lovely little balcony overlooking the street and the roof tops of Kandy.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,4,Great central location,"The best part of this hotel was its location - it is central so very easy to walk around etc. 
the room was nice, but a bit on the small side. It was however noisy and you could hear everything happening around.

We didn’t eat here so can’t comment on food. 

The staff were friendly and helpful.

Nothing special, but also wasn’t overly expensive. 

Would recommend due to its central location.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,5,Good central hotel,"Very central small hotel in Kandy.   Ideally located for all the main sights.  Room and bathroom were well appointed.  Breakfast was good and service was friendly and professional.  One point of note - there is no bar in this hotel, due to the location near the main temple.",Solo
Kandy,The Radh,4,"Great location and friendly staff, but some improvements needed","We used the Radh Hotel as a base in Kandy to explore the other historical sites in the cultural triangle and it was a wise choice. From the minute we entered the hotel, we were treated courteously with a welcome drink. The staff where friendly throughout our stay but at times, we did have to repeat our requests (eg. For more towels or help with luggage when we checked out). Special mention for Danush who was helpful from beginning to end. 

Our room was the Radh Royal Suite which comprised of 2 rooms. Upon our entry into the room, the staff seemed surprised by our request to use both rooms. The 1st room was very impressive, spacious with a king bed. The balcony had a hot tub (which should have been cleaned before we began our stay) with a great view of the surrounding area. Bathroom was of a high quality as well. 

The 2nd room (smaller and no way as impressive as the first) was locked and the bed was not made up. There was a damp and musky feel to this room and the staff had to clean it up before we could use it. The slight mould on the walls was an unpleasant site that ruined a part of the overall experience of the room. 

The breakfast area is also the hotel’s restaurant and the options in the morning catered to our needs. The area is rather small, with only 2 rows able to be accommodated but this did not pose an issue with us. The staff were efficient enough at breakfast and offered tea/coffee and anything else they could help with. 

Location wise, the hotel is situated near the Temple of the Tooth and Kandy Lake. Plenty of restaurants nearby and the markets are within walking distance. Lots of cars seem to be parked outside the hotel so if you are awaiting your driver, it can be bit of a task to find the driver or to wind your luggage between the cars. 

The Radh Hotel was the perfect place to locate ourselves for our part of the Sri Lanka trip that explored the cultural triangle. It would have been the perfect stay if not for some inadequacies but overall, I enjoyed my experience at the hotel.",Family
Kandy,The Radh,2,Poorly run hotel,"A good hotel , well appointed and in the main , run by helpful staff BUT there is no alcohol licence (not disclosed in hotel details)  and the front desk team are basically incompetent and in need of some serious training. The hotel Manager failed to attend a meeting to address my concerns,  instead delegating to an under manager. ( who did his best)  If the hotel manager shows as much contempt towards her staff as she does to her paying guests, she should be removed.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,4,"Good hotel, friendly staff and central location.","A good hotel located in the centre of Kandy. Very friendly staff. Room was a good size, clean and lovely mattress. Shower was hot and good pressure. Good breakfast; the egg hopper was excellent! A little bit of noise from construction work, which we were advised about. Enjoyable stay.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,2,Did not meet our expectations,"We booked a deluxe family suite as we were lead to believe by the hotel and booking.com that was all that was available. At 375USD a night we expected more but were appalled by the suite which was a windowless room lit like a mausoleum, so we asked to change to a room with a balcony which was better. The hotel refused to give us a lower rate for this room though they were on offer for much less on the day, which seemed most unfair. The carpets in the common areas looked tired. The best coffee in town and the restaurant was pretty good, but the hotel did not live up to our expectations. They should also be more forthright that they don’t serve alcohol.",Couples

Negombo,Jetwing Beach,4,Enjoyed our stay,This was our first overnight stop direct from airport with our grand kids visiting Sri Lanka for the first time.

Colombo,Mandarina Colombo,3,Got it! Here's your updated review with all the new points added clearly and professionally:   ---  Excellent Stay with,"Our stay at Mandarina Hotel Colombo was excellent overall. The rooms were spacious, well-maintained, and extremely comfortable. The food was delicious, offering a variety of options, and the housekeeping service was commendable.

However, we did face some service issues. When we checked in, Mr. Abdeen, who was responsible for taking our luggage from reception to our room, refused to lift my handbag, stating that he could not carry a bag containing a water bottle. Additionally, he did not handle the luggage carefully, and my bag was nearly damaged in the process.

At the restaurant, Mr. Ashwin's behavior was disappointing. He repeatedly asked how many people were dining and the ages of the children. During final billing, he unnecessarily checked the passports multiple times for age verification. Worse still, he added extra persons to the bill assuming we wouldn’t notice, as we were a group. But we were very well aware of our count and cross-checked the bill, asking him to revise it. After being corrected, he responded by saying he would check the CCTV footage to verify, which was quite unprofessional and uncomfortable. As we were honest, he found nothing wrong.

Mr. Ashwin needs significant training in customer service and polite behavior. His attitude affected an otherwise wonderful stay.

Despite these issues, everything else—from the rooms to the food and housekeeping—was excellent. With better training for some staff members, this hotel can truly offer a flawless experience.

Would still recommend this hotel for its overall quality and amenities.",Family

Colombo,The Kingsbury Hotel,1,A Huge Dissapointment about this Kingsbury,"Kingsbury is a huge disappointment!!
First of all, when we came by our car, there was no doorman to open the hotel doors or even the back doors of the car. I went there in the third week of March for my best friend's birthday. We were 4 friends in total, and it was our treat for the birthday boy. To my surprise, there was no staff to ask about where Harbour Court was, since it was our first time visiting The Kingsbury. Our first choice was our usual hotel which is a luxury 5-star hotel in Colombo; I prefer not to say their name on here and it is a top ranked hotel on this platform. Yet there were no proper staff or the ones available were very busy with foreign guests. I think they have no interest in serving local Sri Lankan people, where we felt very discriminated against. After asking a person seated on the lobby chairs, who I think was a guest too, we finally found out. We went to Harbour Court. Again, they disappointed me. I made a reservation around 2 pm by calling the hotel for the dinner buffet and asked to reserve a table with a view, that means a 4-pax table near the big glass window. They told me they would surely reserve the relevant table near the window. But the girl at the restaurant reception reserved a table far away from the window and very near to the buffet, where people were busy picking food. It made us very stressed because it was crowded, and we couldn’t even have a little private conversation because people in the food queue could hear us.
OK, that is bearable, we can forgive it. But I was very amazed to see that in this kind of luxury fine dining, there are no waiters. For the whole crowded restaurant, I could find only 3 or 4 managers wearing coats who had no interest in serving guest's requirements, they were just talking and laughing with each other. I saw only one waiter in a waiter suit. We wanted cool water for our glasses after coming to the table with the food. We wanted to say this to a waiter, but there was only one waiter, and I saw maybe three people with ties and white shirts serving others, but they were busy serving the other half of the restaurant. We were wondering, where are these people who are working? These are not fake stories, and I too couldn't believe that we had to face these awful things in this kind of a luxury hotel.

Then, finally, after a few minutes of looking for anyone, a manager came. I can’t remember his name, but he was a bit bald-headed. After asking, he went to bring cold water. Then again, they failed to meet our requirement. They brought OLU water instead of normal filtered water with ice. I think the bottle costs 400 rupees, but with tax and everything, it should be around 600, I guess. The manager brought three OLU water bottles instead of what we asked; normal filtered water with ice. Is there any intention to cost guests more by making profits cunningly? We had to use these OLU bottles because if we reject them, we would have waited another half an hour looking for a waiter to bring us water. I want to mention that one of the managers came and offered us the drinks menu. One of my friends politely said we’ll order later in the eating session because we wanted to. Shockingly, this guy came again and again, insisting that we order some cocktails by being a big headache. He kept recommending different kinds of drinks, disturbing our conversations. Since it was my friend's birthday, I went to the reception girl and requested to sing happy birthday to my friend. I want to mention that on the occasion, there were other people having birthdays and two girls and one boy were singing happy birthday to them. It was unusual they were busy doing that. Somehow, even after two requests, they forgot to wish my friend. It would have made his day!!! After two requests, I stopped asking them to sing and I dropped that idea, thinking never ever coming to this hotel again, and I will not recommend it to anyone. 

I want to strictly ask that, don't you guys care about your guests??? The reason I say that is because including myself, we are big fans of egg hoppers. The action station was queued with a lot of people willing to get hoppers. I think they should put two or more chefs to do that.

After all these things, the main part of the buffet is food, right? I thought we would forget all these shocking disappointments after eating good soothing food with some mouth-watering seafood. But I don’t know the reason, shockingly, we were so unfortunate because the food was extremely disappointing. Steamed rice and biriyani were the only rice options. Not even fried rice was there. Is Kingsbury an Indian hotel like Taj Samudra??? Because 60% of the food was Indian food! The beef was very chewy and not even slightly tender, resulting in me giving back my plate with that low quality beef. My friends strongly recommended that Kingsbury dinner buffet has more seafood varieties than other hotels, but being a seafood lover, I could barely find any seafood. I was wondering where this so-called legacy of Kingsbury has gone. So disappointing! The only seafood was some butter-fried pieces. Thinking something is better than nothing, I ate them. Again, as usual, it was disappointing. They had a very thin small fillet of fish under a big butter-fried layer. 
To be more specific, there was only chewy low-quality cuttlefish and fish with big layers of butter and oil. I mean, what is this guys? How can you make people feel mislead and take huge amounts of money for these low-quality food collections while claiming a very high standard five-star hotel? Then we came to the dessert section. Being a big ice-cream lover, I straightly went to the ice-cream kottu action station. To my huge disappointment, the guy in the dessert section said very rudely, ""There's no ice cream kottu, and we can't provide it since the board of the ice cream kottu maker is broken and not freezing to be eligible to make ice cream kottu."" Guys, this reflects a lack of attention to basic hospitality standards.  Can’t you guys try to repair it as soon as possible and provide the specific dessert again? Instead of being rude to guests. Then I tried to get normal ice cream, but the same rude guy serving ice cream was pouring scoops as little as laddus. Only two little scoops. It was disappointing to see such limited portions being served, especially for a high end buffet. Then the small chocolate pieces were finished, and only dark chocolate and mint chocolate was left, and they were not restocking for people. It’s very sad to see two tables away from us getting a birthday singing with a small cake but not us.

So, thank you very much Kingsbury for showing your true colors!! I am not coming to Kingsbury again and will not recommend it to others. These positive reviews about this Kingsbury are also very false because after paying the bill this manager guy came and asked from the four of us to write a good review with 5 stars mentioning his name. I felt very sad about these guys begging for good reviews on this platform. Finally, to whoever reading this, I wanna say I strongly advise others to reconsider before visiting Kingsbury!",Friends

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,3,Stunning view - well overrated,"When you first arrive at this location the view and staff smiles are certainly nice. Yet this location does not match five star expectation that you would arrive with. While the properties is well maintained, staff definitely needs better attention to detail and the cook should take one or the other cooking class in the countryside, where Sri Lankan food is often made to perfection (something you would expect from a 5-star hotel).
On the upside, the pool is great and has an amazing view and the sky lounge bar makes up for some of the downsides. For a short stop (two nights) we enjoyed it but value for money is absolutely not where it should be.",Family

Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,5,Another level.,"We didn’t stay here but wish we did. We are in Kandy for 2 nights and our hotel is nearby, we ate and had drinks on night one and drinks night 2. Every thing about  this place is excellent, service second to none and the quality is top tier, don’t think it’s expensive either, it’s very reasonable. We would recommend it 100% , if you are in Kandy centre it’s. £2 taxi fare. Do yourself a favour and visit. Ashan was extremely helpful and kind.",Family
Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,5,Perfect Hotel,"This was one of our favourite hotels of our trip.

The view out from the balcony was breath taking and it was a great place to sit and chill. The breakfast and evening buffet was excellent, lots of choice.
We went to the roof top bar in the evening and again the views were amazing and so were the cocktails!",Couples
Kandy,Grand Serendib Hotel,3,A little disappointing,"This hotel was the most expensive of 5 during our trip around SL. On arrival you need to pay in full before going to your room so be prepared if you use Revolut or similar. As is often the way here, you get told nothing at check in and need to work out everything for yourself. Once we were processed and in our room we had half a roll of toilet paper and just 2 hangers for our clothes, which seemed a bit miserly. We ate 2 nights at the hotel. The first night we tried to order a cocktail in the restaurant bar but despite the cocktail menus, no-one there could make them so we went up to the rooftop bar and discovered they also do food up there. I ordered a pork curry which I couldn't eat as the meat was fatty and chewy. My wife ordered the crab curry and was amazed to find that, rather than being served with fresh roti or some other local accompaniment, it came with 4 slices of toast (cheap sliced bread). The following night a lot of places were closed due to the national independence day so we ate again at the hotel and there was a special buffet. It was not bad but when I tried some of the beef curry I had the same issue as the previous night and couldn't eat it. On the positive side, the views are amazing, but many of the staff are quite young and lacking in skills. Basic questions are hard to get answers to, eg ""is the breakfast a buffet?"". I believe there are probably better places to stay in Kandy, which is a very picturesque city with green hills around a pretty lake, but after 3 nights here we were happy to be moving on.",Couples

Colombo,ME Colombo,1,"Food and service was horrible, not to mention ridiculous prices  (along with an unknown charge)","I personally hate writing bad reviews, but this place was horrible.  Firstly, I had read a few reviews ahead of time, and it got good reviews, but I also made sure to check online for the menu.  It had several pictures of an extensive menu displayed (roughly 3-4 pages worth including burgers, pizza, etc.) yet when I sat down and asked the waiter for the menu he passed me a tablet with a single page (only 5 or 6 items on the menu).  I tried scrolling thinking there were more, but it would not scroll!  So I decided on the wok rice with chicken and pineapple juice.  The food preparation took a normal amount of time, and the pineapple juice was good, however, the wok rice with chicken was absolutely horrible.  There was next to no taste, and the only spice was the black pepper added to the chicken.  After spending 2 weeks in Sri Lanka and having some amazing food, this was by far the worst meal I had.  But it does not end there... after finishing I moved my plate to the opposite side of the table and waited.  It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the waiter finally realized I was done (and only because his coworker noticed and sent him over).  When it came time to pay (I had checked before eating that card was OK, which I was told it was) the waiter brought my bill over, did not show it, and took my card which he disappeared upstairs for 3-4 minutes and came back with my receipt.  At no point during my meal did the waiter come by and ask how the meal was, or if I wanted anything else.  This place was absolutely disappointing, and I was very upset with the lack of service and quality of the food.  Something else I noticed, I had been eating all across Sri Lanka for the last 2 weeks (including Colombo) and the only charges on my bill were service charge (mostly 10% of the bill), however, this place I noticed added a 'goverment tax' of almost a third of the bill which I had not seen on any other receipt I received over my entire stay in Sri Lanka.  I would not recommend this place.",Solo

Kandy,The Radh,5,Great stay great staff,"An Excellent Stay – Staff Deserve the Utmost Respect

We had an excellent stay at RADH Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming, professional, and attentive to every detail. The hotel itself is beautifully maintained, offering a perfect blend of comfort and elegance. Our room was spotless, well-appointed, and provided a truly relaxing experience.

However, during our stay, we were deeply ashamed to witness the way some tourists mistreated the hardworking staff. We saw an incident where a guest, after breaking several plates, refused to take responsibility and instead threatened to leave a negative review on TripAdvisor to avoid paying. The staff, despite being in an unfair and helpless situation, handled it with patience and professionalism.

As guests who appreciate good service and ethical behavior, we want to extend our apologies to the staff on behalf of responsible travelers. No one should have to endure such intimidation simply for doing their job. Hospitality workers deserve respect, and it is disheartening to see some guests exploit platforms like TripAdvisor to manipulate situations in their favor.

We highly recommend RADH Hotel and commend the staff for their dedication. Thank you for making our stay memorable—we will certainly return.",Family

Kandy,The Radh,3,Overall disappointed,"This was our 9th accommodation on a four week trip to Sri lanka.  This was going to be the bit of luxury we looked forward to . We felt let down! The room was nice, comfy beds, nice linen, good shower and toiletries. Some freebies in the mini fridge. Nice balcony overlooking the street. But for the money we paid, the most expensive of our trip, there were too many things wrong. These were generally small things but nevertheless added up to a feeling 
 disappointment. Wifi instructions seriously lacking clarity - an annoying start after a long day travelling. Telephone had numbers worn off on the keypad so calling for assistance very hard. Mini fridge door dropped and did not shut properly.  Shower had black mould at the base and in the silicone.  Mirrored pillar on balcony badly cracked. Carpet on landing area stained and scruffy. No hand towel in bathroom and my request for one failed. Noise from construction all day. Why build a roof top pool when simple things are not up to standard? Noise from kitchen area below at 6am. I would not rush to return for the money. We have stayed in much better places for a fraction of the cost . Position good but attention to detail poor",Couples

Kandy,The Radh,4,Great location in Kandy,"Wonderful Stay at The Radh Hotel Kandy

Our experience at The Radh Hotel was truly delightful. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warm hospitality and attentive service. The hotel’s location is ideal—just a short walk from the iconic Temple of the Tooth and the peaceful Kandy Lake, making it a great starting point for exploring the city.

The rooms were beautifully designed, very clean, and equipped with all the modern comforts. We stayed in a room with a private terrace, which added a special touch to our visit. Relaxing outside in the calm surroundings was a highlight.

The on-site restaurant was excellent. The food was fresh, flavorful, and offered a lovely mix of local and international dishes. Breakfast, in particular, stood out with its wide range of delicious options.

One thing to note: there was some noise from construction work right next to our room. Thankfully, the staff responded quickly and stopped the noise when we mentioned it. However, it might be a good idea to check the status of construction if you’re planning to stay soon.

The staff were incredibly kind and professional, always going the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed.

The hotel is clean and well-maintained.
Its central location makes it ideal for exploring Kandy’s key attractions.

Cons:
Despite being heavily advertised, the house-specialty pizza was disappointing and didn’t meet expectations.
The price for the breakfast buffet was far too high considering the offerings, which didn’t justify the cost.

The staff are amazing and are truly attentive to all your needs. They go out of there way to say hello and guide you through the cuisine and hotel amenities. We had our own private pool which was luxurious. The only downside is the access road to the hotel (no fault of the actual resort owners). For my mind a hotel that is bringing in tourist dollars should be looked after however it is hard for any car to enter and exit. Additionally because of this you are stuck having to use the tuk tuks outside the hotel (again not associated with the hotel and scare away any other driver) rather then use pickme or uber. The local authorities should really look into making it a more hospitable environment outside the hotel and keep the tourists coming.,Couples

 We got multiples power outages like 4-5 times in the evening from 19.30h when we got back from our trip (having to shower in the dark).

We were welcomed with a lovely cool towel and welcome drink which was nice and the room we were shown to  was spacious.  unfortunately it smelt musty and so did our clothes once we left.  The bathroom is spacious too, but the shower could do with some maintenance, it had broken tiles and a lot of mould in it.   Breakfast was ok - the usual range available on a buffet.  The swimming pool area is ok too - but again broken and mouldy tiles and overall not that welcoming.  The place is a bit of a bus station and could do with some maintenance.  We checked out a day early.",Couples

Bentota,Cinnamon Bentota Beach - Signature Selection,5,Ideal getaway,"Bentota is situated at an ideal location for a weekend away from Colombo. We've tried most hotels in the area. And this was our second visit to this property. 

Highlights of the property - it's a very large and beautiful property designed by the famous architect Gefforey Bawa. There are also some lovely pieces of art forming part of the interior design. It is a also situated in a unique location with the sea on one side and the Bentara river on the other side. 

There are two wings. We've stayed in both. One wing is a little far away from the restaurants, reception, gym, kids play area etc. We booked a terrace room and were later upgraded to a luxury sea front room. But we could barely see the sea from our room in the first floor (didn't mind though since this was a free upgrade). This is because there is actually a small lane and a tree cover between the property and the public beach. The second floor probably gives better views. But the room was lovely! It was very spacious with a large balcony as well and had all the luxuries. 

They have a sizeable pool. The beach is public (You have to a cross a small lane to get to the beach) but clean. And the hotel does provide some beach chairs and umbrellas. 

They have a fabulous breakfast with a massive spread!!!! (It was actually the highlight of the visit 😉) For lunch, we went a la carte at their sea food restaurant. If I recall correctly, the extensive sea food menu was aviable only for dinner but they had their normal menu and what we got was quite exceptional. 

The dinner was not as fabulous as breakfast (especially the salads and desserts) but still quite good. One pet peeve was that the main restaurant had only a small area which was air conditioned. The rest of the area didn't even have fans. It was extremely humid the day we visited and coupled with the heat from all the cooking, we were sweating buckets, so much so that we kept an alarm on our second day and came very early for breakfast to get a spot in the air-conditioned section. 😀

Both breakfast and dinner had an extensive spread of local, Indian, East Asian and Western dishes. The staff weren't particularly friendly but were quite efficient except for a minor hassel related to our booking.

All in all, highly recommended if you are just looking to laze around (i.e. eat, sleep, swim) in comfort. [P.s they do offer painting classes, yoga, third party managed excursions in the river if you are looking for more energetic options.]",Couples

Kandy,The Radh,1,Poor. We left early.,"Utterly dissapointing and we left the hotel a day early. Do not visit during the Kandy Perahera! We had Ants in our room and we were trapped outside of the hotel for 6 hours until 11:30pm. There was also constant loud construction noise all day. 

We were told to arrive early to avoid any 'inconveniences' due to road closures. We arrived early and our room was not ready. Once we got to the room we found ants and the wrong baggage was taken to our room. 

What was most frustrating is we were never told that we would be unable to exit or enter the hotel after the festival started. To make matters worse it was incredibly crouded, it was hard to get tuk tuks or taxis, local attractions were shut, lots of restaurants were shut with the ones open not serving alcohol. So for 6 hours there was little for us to do.

When we raised our complaint with the Radh after, their customer service was shocking. They argued that there were 5 ants as if it was acceptable and that they messaged us to say 'arrive before 2pm to avoid inconveniences due to road closures'. This was not a warning about entry or exit after the festival started.

Overall, it caused undue stress and upset on our honeymoon & my Wife's birthday.",Couples
Kandy,The Radh,5,"Great service, excellent breakfast.","Fantastic location in central Kandy and the hotel feels like an oasis of calm away from the heat and freneticism of the city. We were upgraded to a room with a plunge pool which was wonderful. Only minor point is that room 101 is next to the jewellery counter so can be a little noisey in the evening if you have small children.

Breakfast was delicious and there’s a good evening meal selection including, unexpectedly, a big Japanese menu.

Service was fantastic and we’d certainly recommend.",Family

Great hot shower and they use Spa Ceylon which was nice.

Handed 2 pcs of shirt to the hotel for washing and it was returned within hours which was fantastic and it was only 250LKR per pc.

Breakfast was a semi-buffet style there's fruit, cheese and cereal available, and you can order on top rice and curry, or western breakfast. The portion was huge.

Bentota,Ekho Surf,3,My fascinating stay in the coasts of Benthota,"Overall, I would describe my hotel experience average. To start with, the rooms were perfect for a luxurious stay. The maintenance was excellent according to my personal opinion. According to my taste, the flavours were not so appealing to Sri Lankan taste buds. Anyways, the meals were prepared by careful hands.
I highly recommend the hotel for foreign tourists who fancy the exotic coastal landscape of Sri Lanka.",Family

Bentota,Ekho Surf,1,DO NOT BOOK HERE,"Literally THE WORST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED IN. Whatever you do. Don’t book it!!! Pay a little extra and go somewhere else. 

Staff were terrible re service and level and quality of service. I would ask for ice and would wait 30-40 mins before having to follow up on where the ice was. When I’d ask sometimes they’d say they didn’t have any. Which is ridiculous for the size of the hotel. 

Left my room at 7am ,left sign for fresh bedding/ room tidy. Got back at 2.30pm nothing done. Then called and said someone there in 5 mins. 20mins later called back again. Another 20 mins still nothing had to go ask someone down the corridor to help. 

Food terrible and tasteless. Hotel rooms dated and OLDDDDD and not very clean at all!! In addition be prepared to not have a plug socket anywhere near the bed. 

Only good thing was checkout and the beach.",Solo

Service was top-notch too—friendly, professional staff who made us feel truly welcome.

The only downside was some ongoing construction nearby, which did cause a bit of noise during the day. It wasn’t a deal-breaker, but it did take away slightly from the peaceful atmosphere.

Overall, it’s a fantastic hotel and we’d definitely come back—hopefully once the construction is done. Still highly recommend for a relaxing beach escape!",Friends

Kasun assisted us with showing the room and completing the payment process. He also gave us detailed information about the hotel. From the moment we arrived, he was extremely helpful and kind. We truly appreciated the service we received from Kasun.

Galle,Le Grand Galle,1,"Extremely Disappointing Stay at Le - Grand Hotel, Galle, Sri Lanka– Not Worth the 5-Star Rating","We stayed at Le - Grand Hotel, Galle from May 11th to May 12th, 2025, on a Full Board, (Double) basis, and unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected from a 5-star hotel.

🔹 Location & View:
The only highlight of our stay was the stunning view of the Galle Fort. The hotel’s location is excellent close to the Galle fort with beautiful scenery.

🔹 Room Issues:
The room allocated to us was not in good condition. The main door lock was faulty, and although a technician was sent to fix it after i made a request to rectify, it took about 45 minutes, disturbing our privacy and taking away from our short one day stay.
Additionally, the balcony door wouldn’t close properly and remained unfixed during our stay creating a serious security and comfort concern.

🔹 In-room Amenities:
Despite our booking being for 2 people on FB basis, the room was only arranged and stocked for one person, only one bottle of water, single sets of tea/coffee, shampoo, body wash and etc. I had to repeatedly call, request and remind staff to provide necessities what we required for 2 people.

To make matters worse, one of the towels provided was damaged, which was shocking and unacceptable from a hotel claiming to be 5-star. (Photo attached)

🔹 Dining Experience:
The dinner buffet had very limited variety and the food quality was poor. The breakfast buffet was even worse. Certain items like sausages and eggs were hidden and not freely offered unless specifically requested. We asked for two cheese omelets, but after waiting for nearly 30 minutes, we received only one, and it didn’t even have cheese.

🔹 Checkout Experience:
Our checkout was scheduled at 12 PM, but since lunch was only served from 1:30 PM, we requested a late checkout, which was denied. We were left waiting outside until lunch started.
Adding insult to injury, instead of a buffet lunch (which was part of the FB plan), we were given an à la carte menu, as the hotel claimed low occupancy. During this time, staff behavior was unwelcoming. they looked at us as if we were loitering, which made us feel very uncomfortable and disrespected.

🔹 Overall Summary:

- Poor room condition and maintenance
- Insufficient in room amenities for a double occupancy
- Damaged towel provided. This is totally unacceptable and disappointed (Photo attached)
- Low quality food and lack of verities in buffet offerings
- Poor service and unacceptable attitude by some staff when we were waiting for the lunch despite FB booking
- No flexibility with check-out (Even we booked FB basis)

Our stay at Le Grand Hotel, Galle was extremely disappointing and not worth the premium pricing and the 5-star rating. We would not recommend this hotel, especially if you’re expecting comfort, proper service, or value for money.",Family
Bentota,Cinnamon Bentota Beach - Signature Selection,5,Cinnamon Bentota,"The best thing about this hotel is its staff. They were very welcoming, hospitable and kind.

The pools are lovely, and the pool bar is cool. The team there is friendly, attentive, and they even remembered our previous orders, which made us feel genuinely welcomed.
The buffet for both breakfast and dinner were excellent, offering a wide variety of tasty dishes with something for everyone. The setting, overlooking the lake, made the dining experience even more enjoyable. The selection covers most cuisines, so there's always something new and delicious to try.

Bentota,Ekho Surf,3,The Views from the Room are Good..,"The location of the property and the views from the room are excellent.
The staff at check-in and check-out are good.
However, the service at the hotels is extremely slow. Extremely.
A cup of coffee can anywhere above 40 minutes.
Room service can take over an hour to deliver a meal.
At billing we found a discrepancy in our bill and had to be revised.
There is no coffee machine at the buffet and we had to order it from the cafe on the other side of the property and this would be available only after 9AM.
Watermelon juice was served with the seeds crushed into it. Had to specifically ask them not to do this.
The pool adjoining the rooms could cleaner.
The A/c's in one of the rooms was erratic.
The staff is obviously trained to ask for reviews and to specifically mention staff names, which is very clear from the reviews on Trip Advisor.",Friends

Bentota,Ekho Surf,5,Recommend,"I had a wonderful stay at EKHO Surf today and would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the entire team. The beachfront location is stunning, offering breathtaking views and a truly relaxing atmosphere. The staff were exceptionally warm and attentive, always ready to assist with a smile. From check-in to check-out, the service was seamless and professional.

The room was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably furnished, with everything I needed for a pleasant stay. I especially appreciated the attention to detail and the effort to create a welcoming environment. The food was another highlight—delicious, fresh, and with a good variety to suit all tastes.

That said, a few areas could use some improvement. The Wi-Fi connection was a bit inconsistent at times, and a few more vegetarian options on the menu would be appreciated. Also, the poolside could benefit from a few more shaded lounging areas.

Overall, EKHO Surf exceeded my expectations. It’s an ideal place for both relaxation and adventure, and I would gladly return. Thank you for making my stay memorable and enjoyable.

Special thanks to Front office team - Aruni, Maleesha, Chethana, Emil, Suneth",Couples

The staff were incredibly warm and attentive. A special shoutout to Imashi, who looked after every little detail and made our stay feel extra special. Dinner by Chef Thiran Fernando was a standout — he customized the meal to our taste and it turned out to be one of the best meals of our entire trip.

Another unique experience was the Ayurvedic consultation with their in-house doctor before our wellness session. It added a deeply personal and thoughtful touch, and made the whole experience feel truly holistic and rejuvenating.

Negombo,Jetwing Lagoon Wellness,5,"Great property, delicious food and wonderful service!","This was our second visit to Jetwing Lagoon and it really is one of the best  places to unwind, de-stress and detox. The property is spacious, quiet and serene and the lawn by the lagoon is a great space to chill. The rooms are exceptionally large and very comfortable (we were in a luxury room in the ground floor overlooking the lagoon). The menu incorporates both healthy and regular options and all the dishes we tried were delicious and beautifully presented. It was especially  nice to see a lot of imaginative fusion dishes incorporating local ingredients (especially recommend the Negombo Coconut Cake and the woodapple smoothie). But the most impressive thing about the hotel (as always) was the outstanding staff. The service is really top-notch. My parents are elderly and therefore have some mobility challenges and specific dietary needs. The restaurant team (Aruna, Imashi, Ranmini, Nadeesha and Pasindu) went the extra mile to make sure that all their needs were fulfilled and that they had an enjoyable stay. Their genuine kindness and attentiveness made my parents feel truly welcomed and at ease. A warm thank-you also to the amiable Ravindu from Housekeeping for his warm and efficient service and for taking such good care of us all! His thoughtful care left a lasting impression on our stay and is much appreciated. The spa is well-appointed and our therapists Nuwan, Mahel and Insam were clearly skilled and well-trained.

Colombo,Galle Face Hotel,5,Hotel with a colonial charm,"Galle Face Hotel is a historic gem in Colombo, and we thoroughly enjoyed its beachfront location and the stunning ocean views from the Firebeach pub. The atmosphere, enhanced by live music and colonial charm, made our stay especially memorable.

The service throughout the hotel was warm and friendly, including from General Manager Suresh Abbas, who was often visible and engaging with guests.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. Although we had booked three rooms, the front office declined our request for a late checkout on just one room unless we paid half the room rate, which felt a bit inflexible. Some parts of the hotel are showing signs of age—for example, the carpet along the corridor is quite worn and would be better removed if it can’t be replaced.

We also had a safety concern with the shower setup over the bathtub, as there was no anti-slip mat provided. Fortunately, the hotel responded promptly and moved us to another room the next day upon request.",Friends
Colombo,Galle Face Hotel,5,Great stay,"Had a great stay. Staff were amazing. Room stunning. We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the sea. Belinda, Manuka,Dinushi and Ivoni were so helpful. Guys at Firebeach lovely. All in all a great start to our trip.",Couples
Colombo,Galle Face Hotel,5,A Touch Of Class.,"My six months of travelling in Sri Lanka sadly draws to an end. During that time, I’ve stayed in private villas, hostels and family homes. For my final two nights in the capital city, I wanted some luxury with a colonial touch. An iconic landmark that would hold a lasting memory. 

For over 160 years, Galle Face Hotel has blended colonial charm with modern elegance, earning its place as the Grande Dame of South Asia and the most iconic destination in Colombo. Celebrates such as Steven Spielberg, Che Guevara, Earnest Hemingway, Sting, Sade, Robbie Williams, Lord Mountbatten and Richard Nixon have stayed here. 

The buffet is fantastic and I’m not a fan of these at all. Service is impeccable and staff go above and beyond to ensure you have a memorable stay whilst here. They’re proud to work here. The pool is unfortunately salt water and not chlorinated. The views are spectacular and for once I never left the hotel. This very unusual for me. 

The passionfruit frozen daiquiri is to die for as is the cheesecake. The mutton Rogan Josh was delicious, the sweet selection, gin & tonics and of course the Lion draught beer. This was impulsively booked right at the last minute. My room was fit for a prince, overlooking the Indian Ocean and Galle Face Green. Spectacular and what an outstanding front of house team. A touch of class, sophistication and elegance.",Solo

Because of the extra bed the room became congested with our luggages. So for triple occupancy a bigger room should have been allocated. The shower area is almost half of the room whereas there is separate toilet and hand-wash area. The infinity pool is just awesome. However, the size especially the width is so narrow that it's rather an area to see the view than swim. Generally out of their 4 lifts 2 remain operational at any time. As there lobby is in 1st floor and there is no stairs except probably fire exit, the wait time is quiet high in rush hours. Last but not the least, the head pillow cases are made of uncomfortable material that it's creates difficulty to sleep.",Family
Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,5,Housekeeping team,"I stayed at the Grandbell Hotel for four nights, and I was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional housekeeping service throughout my stay. From the moment I arrived, the room was spotless,fresh linens, clean towels, and a wonderfully pleasant scent that made the space feel welcoming and comfortable.

Each day, the housekeeping team maintained these high standards with remarkable consistency. They were discreet, efficient, and respectful of our belongings, which made the experience even more enjoyable.

I would especially like to mention Oshadi, who stood out for her excellent work on one of the days. Her attention to detail and care were truly commendable. Thank you, Oshadi, for going the extra mile!",Friends

Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,5,Quality Japanese hotel.,"Stayed 5 nights for the second time at Granbell Colombo.  With beautiful view and Japanese technology. Japanese toilets,  breathing taking view from the roof top bar and the pool. Good quality tecnogym equipments, sauna, bubble bath. A very big thanks to Danaja, the FO manager for looking after us.  The room key kept on deactivating and every time had to go down to the reception. one thing the hotel can improve is the waiting time for the lifts.  it takes ages to get a lift. Even with 4 lifts but with 27 floors, it's busy during peak hours. I would suggest either installing some digital advertising on the floors or mirrors next to the lifts  so guests don't feel the waiting time. All in all, it's a very good hotel. situated in the central area.",Friends

Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,2,Disappointed about the management here,"We particularly had an unsatisfactory experience with the inconsistency of cleaning service especially in the first few days however I felt even worse when I spoke with manager who was defensive, dismissive and did not fully acknowledged our feelings. With conversation with the manager, I noticed that some could be identified as misunderstanding or miscommunication however overall, I don't think this quality of service is acceptable in 4 star hotel. I am now regretting that I spoke with him because he was not trying to do something to make me feel better, rather I felt as if he blamed me and treated me like a silly customer who is trying to take an advantage of the situation. This made me feel very miserable. He walked away at 8:50 am stating that ""I have a meeting at 9"" and did not show the willingness to speak any further.

As a Japanese, I felt really disappointed that such poor quality of service is provided by the Japanese corporate. I admit that the facility, location, some of the staff members are great here. Especially Aidan at reception was over and beyond - when I addressed the same issue, he genuinely treated me with compassion and empathy and validated my feelings, saying ""Is there anything I can do ma'am"". Aidan worked really hard so that we can extend our stay in the same room as both me and my husband became sick and wished to do so. 
Housekeeping supervisor Suraj who cleaned our room in the fifth date of our stay was also kind, attentive and extremely accommodating. We appreciate him for bringing extra water bottles from downstairs for us as we were recovering from our sickness. I felt that Suraj was the one who finally provided us with a right level of cleaning service.

I can see some of the negative reviews which I sometimes doubt about but now I can truly understand how people who wrote these felt. They are mostly about staff's attitude and the quality of cleaning that as the leading the cause of disappointment. These are all about management and process issues, not staff members.",Business

Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,1,Worst experience of our 15 day tour.,"The rooms are small with no cupboard and no dedicated space for baggage. The bed is hard and the pillows covered in a plastic material that makes a crunching sound. The safe was not working/no power which was reported to reception. We got tired of waiting and went to dinner and when we returned to the room the safe was operational, which meant that someone had accessed the room whilst we were out. The tv is incredibly difficult to get to work and the supplied instructions were no help, another call to reception. The dinner was 2 nasi gorengs (quite dry), a long neck of Lion larger and an arrack cocktail. Cost 7700 rupees but add to this service charge 10%, TDL 1%, VAT 18% and SSCL 2.5% and we ended up paying 10343.40 rupees. We are on a tour and this is the only place where there was no welcome and it took a long time to get our rooms and baggage sorted. If you need an electric Japanese crapper then this is for you but otherwise take your business elsewhere.",Couples

The hotel’s old-world charm really stood out — it felt like we’d stepped into a more elegant time, and we absolutely loved that feeling. While we did notice a few signs of modern changes creeping in, it didn’t take away from the overall experience, which was still wonderful.

A big thank you to Ruth at the front desk, who greeted us with such warmth and professionalism. Her friendly and efficient manner made us feel instantly welcome and really set the tone for the rest of our visit.

Dinner at The Magnolia was another highlight of our stay. The service was fantastic, and we felt so well looked after. A special thanks to Anthony and Sanjeewa — your attentive and kind service truly made our evening special. You're both fantastic at what you do!

Nuwara Eliya,The Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya - Heritage Grand,2,We Love This Hotel – But Very Disappointed by the Front Office Manager,"We Love This Hotel – But Very Disappointed by the Front Office Manager

My family and I stayed at the Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya on Friday, May 9th, 2025, for two nights. We have been visiting this hotel for more than 30 years. It’s a very special place to us, and we’ve always had beautiful memories here since we were children.

The hotel looks lovely now .It’s been beautifully refurbished. The garden is still stunning, and the whole place feels very warm and homely. We always choose the Grand Hotel when we visit Nuwara Eliya.

This time, most of the staff were friendly and welcoming, especially at the entrance. But sadly, our experience was affected by the front office. The lady who handled our booking was not very friendly, but we didn’t pay much attention at first. However, our biggest disappointment was with the front office manager a lady whose name starts with ""K.""

She was extremely rude, unfriendly, and arrogant from the start. Her attitude was cold, her body language was dismissive, and she spoke to us as if we were in a police station. She was not flexible, didn’t smile, and treated us in a very unpleasant way. We didn’t feel like guests – we felt like we were being questioned or told off. It was honestly shocking.

We kindly ask the management to please speak to her. Guests come to the hotel paying for a relaxing and enjoyable stay  not for free and definitely not to be treated with such a bad attitude. Her behaviour completely ruined the warm and homely feeling we’ve always loved at this hotel. We have travelled many times, even abroad, but we have never experienced such rude treatment from a front office manager anywhere else.

The rest of the staff were lovely. They were kind, professional, and respectful exactly what we expect from a hotel like this. They helped make the rest of our stay more pleasant.

Special thanks to the team at the Thai restaurant — the food was fantastic, and the staff, especially Chrithana and Anthony, were excellent. They were friendly, caring, and made us feel very comfortable. Honestly, the Thai food was better than anything we’ve had in Colombo! The breakfast was also great , fresh, tasty, and well presented.

We truly love the Grand Hotel and have so many memories here. Please don’t let one staff member take that away from loyal guests like us. We hope to return again, but we do hope the front office service improves.",Family

We enjoyed dining at Grand Indian, Grand Thai, Magnolia, and Barns Hall buffet, all of which offered high-quality food at reasonable prices. The only minor downside was that tea was somewhat pricey, which is surprising for a tea-producing country.
Every staff member was outstanding, making our stay even more pleasant. The garden was beautifully maintained and stunning, so much so that we spent most of our three-day stay relaxing within the hotel grounds.",Friends

Colombo,Marino Beach Colombo,5,One of the best hotels in the world.  No kidding.,"Is Marino Beach Colombo the best hotel in the world?  Possibly. It is certainly one of them. 

I have traveled extensively and was pleasantly surprised over and over again during my two stays at the Marino Beach Hotel.   Why?  Staffing and service; rooms and  guest amenities; and unexpected extras.   

Staffing and service: the staff at Marino Beach hotel is plentiful, responsive, welcoming, and well-trained.   They exude self-respect and respect for their guests.   There was always someone available when needed at the concierge desk, dining room, check-in, and for special requests.   In fact, the hotel has a ""hostess"" in the lobby who greets you immediately when you enter or come off the elevator and answers questions or directs you where needed.  The manager sits at a desk right in the lobby, so they always know what is going on on the floor and can help as needed.   The staff teams in each area seem to have a chain of command, but everyone also cheerfully pitches in and appear to enjoy each other's company.   How did they achieve this positive culture so consistently throughout the organization?   I don't know, but I think other organizations could learn a lot by studying them. 

Rooms and amenities:  Whoever designed the Marino Beach Hotel took the best features from every other 5-star hotel and put them all in one place.  My favorites: 1) There is great lighting in the bathroom and even a lighted make-up mirror!  The bathroom also features a separate tub and walk-in shower; a drying line; hooks for your towel; lots of toiletry supplies of all kinds; easily accessible towels; and clear walls so it feels spacious, but also has an electric shade if you want to wall off the bathroom from the bedroom.  The sinktop has room for all our stuff.  The water pressure is excellent and it's easy to adjust the water temperature.   The bathroom is perfect. 

2) There is balcony with a sea view from every room and two comfortable chairs, which is also a great place to dry your bathing suit. 

3) The bed is large and comfy, and each side of the bed can control its own reading light, a bedside light, and the room lights.  Wow!   

4) There is lots of storage in the room: a large closet with drawers and plenty of hangers; bedside tables with two spacious drawers in each; and other various nooks and drawers for your stuff.    There is also a lot of tabletop surface.   

5) The room is large, nicely appointed and spotlessly clean.  You can control the temperature.  It has sunblocking drapes as well as light white drapes.   The room has a refrigerator and a safe, both of which work easily.   There is a water boiler and a selection of tea and coffee with condiments.  The space feels great. 

6) The hotel itself has a stunning and large infinity pool on the roof, with different areas for seating -- at the edge of the pool, in the water; in sunbeds with curtains;  and sunbeds in the garden.   Even when there were a lot of people a the pool, you never felt crowded.   And there are three hottubs!  Enough for everyone!  The pool even has a smaller, separated area, which is where the families tended to hang out.  The smaller pool felt safer for kids, I think.  

Unexpected Extras:
This is where Marino Beach Hotel especially shines and delights guests.   

1) There is a FREE, 3-hour city tour that covers many of the major sights in Colombo, and gives you time to get off the bus and actually visit the sites.  The hotel pays for entrance fees.   Unfortunately, my husband and I did not do the hotel's city tour because, before we arrived in Colombo, we had scheduled other touristy things that filled our days.  But when we talked with guests who did the hotel's city tour we were very sad that we had toured with other organizations.  The Marino Beach Hotel tour sounded better than anything we had done. 

2) The Hotel owns a BEACH AREA with a restaurant, sunbeds, and a beautiful clean beach only 10 minutes away.  There are hourly shuttles to the beach area.   FANTASTIC. 

3) There are sodas and water in the refrigerator, and cookies and peanuts on the counter for guests to consume. . . free of charge. So sweet. 

4) The hotel restaurants are all top-of-the-line.  In fact, we ended our tour in-country a day early so we could come back to Marino Beach and enjoy the pool, the gym, and especially the fantastic restaurants.   On the 10th floor, there is an Ocean Grill and a Chinese/Thai restaurant; you can order from both menus.   The sea bass at the Ocean Grill with lemon butter sauce was TO DIE FOR.    All their entrees come with a choice of sauces.  My husband had a great hamburger.   The breakfast buffet has too many  options; we always ended up stuffing ourselves.   Be sure to reserve the breakfast buffet when you reserve your room -- it costs twice as much if you have to buy breakfast separately. 

Finally, I will tell you that the Marino Beach Hotel will be listed as a 4-star hotel in the websites like TripAdvisor.  It is a 5-star hotel or better, but the government of Sri Lanka requires a minimum room charge for 5-star hotels that is higher than what Marino Beach charges.   We felt like the Marino Beach Hotel was a fantastic value.   You just won't go wrong in any way at this place.  At least, that was our experience.",Couples

Colombo,Fairway Colombo,5,A Memorable Long Stay at Fairway Colombo – Truly Felt Like Home!,"I had the pleasure of staying at Fairway Colombo from January to March 2025, and I must say—it was one of the best hotel experiences I’ve had.

Right from check-in, the hospitality was outstanding. Kapil was really great in taking care of the hospitality. A special mention to Tharushi, who went above and beyond by offering me a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Her warmth, professionalism, and genuine care made an immediate impression and set the tone for my entire stay. Thank you, Tharushi & Kapil, for making me feel so welcome from day one!

The suite itself was spacious, stylish, and equipped with all modern amenities—ideal for a long-term guest like me. It had everything I needed to feel comfortable and productive, including fast Wi-Fi, smart lighting, and a cozy ambiance.

Location: Perfectly situated near the Dutch Hospital Precinct with easy access to restaurants, historical landmarks, and the city’s vibrant culture, while still offering peace and quiet inside the hotel.

Facilities and Service:

Impeccable housekeeping and cleanliness throughout the stay

Friendly, efficient staff always ready to assist

A rooftop bar with great views—perfect for relaxing evenings

In-house dining with a solid mix of local and international dishes

After staying nearly three months, Fairway Colombo truly became a second home. The service consistency, warm staff, and thoughtful touches made every day pleasant. I will absolutely return and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Colombo for business or leisure.

Colombo,Fairway Colombo,1,Horrible & Atrocious,"Horrible & Atrocious!

This is a No Star Hotel,

Don't wish anyone esle to go thru this.....

After excellent experience in various hotels in Sri Lanka at Bentota, Kanday, etc, we are going thru this horrible hotel, atrocious staff at Fairway Hotel in Colombo.

1. We were asked to leave from dinner hall located on 9th floor by one of the waiters named Silva. Pic of my untouched dinner plate and the waiter -Silva is attached here. See his expression talking to hotel guests.

Seems, guests with appetite for insults are welcome here.

2. This hotel doesn't provide bathroom slippers. Given the level of service or rather lack of it, they should provide boots!

3. Rooms are too small . If ur above 5'-8"" This hotel is not for you or ur family.

4. Staff at reception is too young & inexperienced. Be readyto help yourself, as these guys give guests directions to approach some other hotel staff to address needs!.

5. Hotel doesn't provide water . One has to buy water from hotel each time. Get ur water stock before you check in this hotel!

6.Dont waste time ordering for food from ur room, they don't serve anything!. U r expected to dial 3 different numbers , and keep check on all of them.....

My wife is still tracing my dinner food order with hotel staff at 11 at night!!!!

So good luck to u if u stay here !",Family

Relaxing in the infinity pool and watching the rippling water of the lake too you into unparalleled  relaxation.

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,3,Great Hotel with a Run Down Feel,"I recently stayed at this hotel, and I have to say that the potential is there for a fantastic experience. But it was, unfortunately, overshadowed by the overall run-down condition of the property . I was surprised to see the condition of the room. It's seems like basic requirements are not  met. The telephone is full of dust, and the mini bar is filthy. Few toilet bulbs aren't working.Its seems like no one checked the room prior to the arrival. But I was pleased with the breakfast offerings. There were a variety of options available that all of us enjoyed . 
The hotel is a hidden GEM that desperately needs more attention . I hope they invest in  improvements soon before it's too late.",Family

Thank you Apsara for making our stay a  memorable one. 
Not only the scenic view of Pidurangala & Sigiriya & the tasty food but the stories told by the night watchman( sorry for not knowing his name) at second floor for my kids also made the stay memorable.
I would like to specially thank the young chef at fried rice corner on 30th for that delicious fried rice my son .   
I always wondered why all the people gush over this hotel but now I know . I will be definitely there for another celebration.

Buffet breakfast was amazing, rooms spacious and comfy with outlooks over the valley and out towards Sigyria in the distance. It’s hard to believe this place is nearly 30 years old. The only problem was that the monkeys can be a bit problematic…they don't bother anyone but nothing can be left lying around on the balconies. Small price to pay for being surrounded by nature. It’s very isolated so don’t plan on eating at nearby restaurants…there aren’t any but there are lots of options at the hotel from snacks to full meals.",Friends

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,A Destination Hotel allow time to enjoy it.,"We are not resort people prefer to get out and about and mix it with the locals, when not part of a package we generally eat very few meals at our resort/hotel. 

Heritance is a destination hotel it was the one time in a 19 day tour we wished we had more time in the resort. I won't go into all the details about the place it is well documented, one of the things we really enjoyed was the wild life Monkeys and Birds at our backdoor especially in the morning. All rooms look out and are private we were lucky to be looking out to a bush covered slope full of wildlife. Not really a bucket list moment but sitting in the bathroom doing your morning business with a monkey 20 feet away looking at you is probably a once in a life time experience.

If you do stay here allow time to enjoy the resort great views, great wildlife, lovely infinity pool right next to a great little cafe and bar. Hint keep your balcony door locked and don't leave anything outside not even clothes to dry.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,4,A view o Sigiriya rock fortress.,"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama for two nights and overall had a lovely experience. 

The hotel itself is stunning, blending seamlessly with nature, views, elephants and rocks. Rooms were good size, comfy bed and lovely bathroom.

The staff were helpful and courteous throughout our stay. 

Unfortunately the breakfast buffet was not good, 2 mornings the chicken curry not cooked properly.  The al-la carte dinner was mixed in with the buffet people, worst situation, horrible atmosphere  and the meals the smallest we have seen.  My husband was very hungry after the meal.

We decided on the second night to eat at the open air cafe and this was such a blessing.  Ambience perfect, food delicious and the food was top-notch with plenty of variety and excellent taste. So much better than upstairs.

We did face an very important issue during our stay.  There are no usb ports or spare electrical outlets anywhere in the rooms. We had to unplug a bedside lamp only to find our convertor was too large as the outlets were right on the floor, so usb cables could not be plugged in.  Contacted staff and they immediately bought us a special box to plug our cables into, which was appreciated.  Next morning senior management confirmed not all rooms had been renovated and they were a number of these rooms with the same issue. So beware if you are in one of those rooms.

The views were amazing from the hotel, we got to see the pools but because we were on tour and not at hotel until late each night we were unable to utilize them.

This hotel was one of the better ones of our tour. Recommended.",Family
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,4,Beautiful Property with Great Service,"We stayed at Heritance Kandalama for two nights and overall had a lovely experience. The hotel itself is stunning, blending seamlessly with nature, and the location is absolutely superb—perfect for a peaceful, scenic getaway. The staff were helpful and courteous throughout our stay, and the food was top-notch with plenty of variety and excellent taste.

However, we did face some discomfort during our stay due to the air conditioning in our room. It was a particularly hot season, and the AC was fixed at 28°C, which made the room quite warm and uncomfortable. Although the staff made efforts to resolve the issue, they couldn’t do much as it’s part of a central AC system.

Additionally, we noticed that common areas such as the Kanchana Lounge didn’t seem to be air-conditioned either—possibly due to low occupancy during this period—but it did make the heat a bit more noticeable.

Despite the AC issues, the hotel delivered in terms of service, food, and ambiance. With a few adjustments to the cooling system, this could easily be a 5-star stay.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,The Best Hotel in the World,"I had stayed at Heritance Kandalama with my wife and friends a year ago and we had had a very special time. Because of our past experience I returned this year with my friends and family in a large group of 16 persons of whom 6 are over 70 years of age.

The design by Geoffrey Bawa is sheer genius. The unobtrusive presence of the hotel on the landscape and its apparent merger with its surroundings, it’s beautifully ventilated corridors and strategically positioned rooms along with its magnificently framed views make each visit more rewarding and revelatory than the last.

The service, the rooms and the food were as outstanding as ever. We were a large group with different dietary requirements and preferences, and the hotel took care to cater to each one of us individually. Not only this, the pasty chef Mr Thalin Malinda and the dining room manager Mr Sarath organised cakes to celebrate the birthdays of members of our group. The hotel tour by the naturalist and in-house hotel historian Mr Nalinda should not be missed. 

However, there is one incident which now endears this hotel to us even more and shows its special character. While on elephant safari over an hour away from the hotel a member of our party who has an external heart pump suddenly realised that she had only 40 minutes of battery life left and had forgotten her spare battery in her hotel room and without which she could not survive.

While she rushed from the elephant reserve to the hotel, the hotel manager Mr Gamini took the battery from her room and drove in his personal vehicle to meet the patient half-way and they managed to replace the depleted battery in the very nick of time even after the beeping had already begun.
This was service over and beyond the call of duty or any expectation we could’ve had!

If I could bestow this hotel the *best hotel in the world award* I would.

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Unforgettable Destination Wedding Experience with Exceptional Service in a Breathtaking Setting,"We had the most incredible experience hosting our wedding at Heritance Kandalama. From the very beginning - planning everything a year in advance from abroad - the team was kind, responsive, and extremely professional. They helped us organize room blocks for our guests, finalize the venues and menus, and thoughtfully plan details for the wedding day.

Most of our guests stayed at the hotel for the week leading up to the wedding day, and it was truly a serene, one-of-a-kind setting that allowed everyone to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of Sri Lanka. The staff showed an exceptional level of care and hospitality the entire week - we’ve never experienced anything like it.

On the day of the wedding, everything went perfectly. The timeline was smooth, the logistics were seamless, and we felt fully supported from start to finish. We were able to truly be present and enjoy every moment.

We couldn’t be more grateful to the team for the experience they gave us as a couple and for the beautiful memories they helped create for all our guests. Highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a meaningful, well-executed wedding experience.

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,A Perfect Blend of Luxury and Nature,"Our stay at Heritance Kandalama was truly unforgettable. The hotel’s location is breathtaking, nestled in nature with stunning views of Kandalama Lake and Sigiriya Rock. The architecture blends seamlessly into the environment, and strolling through the open-air corridors with monkeys and birds around was such a unique touch. Our room was clean, spacious, and offered a spectacular view of the lake. The infinity pool overlooking the water was a definite highlight—peaceful, scenic, and ideal for unwinding. The buffet offered a wide variety of delicious dishes, and the staff were consistently friendly and attentive. Overall, it was a peaceful, refreshing escape.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,4,Present stay in Kandalama,"Kandalama! Great hotel with super service, friendly staff. Good food. Needed to mention a few names but couldn't remember. The senior staff who has a long standing service still stands the same. The new staff is also good remember one girl from the kitchen dept was very helpful in helping me out since I am allergic for some ingredients. If I could remember her name right it was Mandy from the kitchen staff. 
All in all it was a pleasant stay. Will always recommend Kandalama.",Friends

The buffet offered a wide spread of delicious dishes, beautifully presented and full of flavour. The warm hospitality from the staff made it even more special, and the serene atmosphere with views of the lake and forest was a real treat.

Unawatuna,Araliya Beach Resort & Spa,4,"Great First Impression, But Food Could Be Better","Our first impression of the hotel and rooms was excellent. It’s a massive property, and the rooms were incredibly spacious—well beyond our expectations. While our group typically isn’t fond of antique or homestyle furniture when on holiday, we were relieved to have booked the Deluxe category, which featured modern box beds that suited our preferences.

The only downside was the dining experience. The buffet, particularly during dinner, was quite average with limited variety. Many of the dishes had a subtle bitter aftertaste, which was a bit off-putting. Given the overall standard of the hotel, we had higher expectations for the food, but unfortunately, it didn’t quite deliver.

Even the beach area was not clean.",Friends

Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,3,Beautiful Views & Friendly Vibes – But Not Ideal for Remote Work,"I stayed at the Granbell Hotel in Colombo and overall had a pleasant experience. 

For a closer look, I made a tour available on YouTube search @theflyguyplus or ""Colombo’s Most Stunning Hotel View | Granbell Hotel Sri Lanka Review""

The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the city with gorgeous views of both the ocean and the skyline, especially from the rooftop pool and lounge area. The room was clean, modern, and well-kept by hardworking housekeeping staff.

That said, there were a few quirks worth mentioning for future guests. 

The in-room safe was far too small to fit a standard 13-inch laptop, which might be inconvenient if you're traveling with tech. And the front desk staff? Let’s just say they fully embraced “island time”...service was friendly but not always prompt. It added a bit of charm and humor to the stay.

If you're hoping to do remote work during your trip, this may not be the right hotel for you. The wi-fi in the room was quite weak, and there really wasn’t enough space in the common areas to set up a laptop comfortably or plug in for power. While the lobby and lounge areas had better Wi-Fi, they weren’t particularly designed for working.

Bottom line: This is a lovely hotel for a vacation or short stay with great ambiance and views. But if you need a solid work setup and fast in-room internet, you might want to consider other options.

Would I stay again for leisure? Yes.
Would I stay again to work remotely? Probably not.",Business
Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,3,Breakfast at Grandbell,"Had breakfast with family at Grandbell main restaurant. 
Buffet was value for money, but food quality needs to be improved. 
Restaurant space seems very limited considering the number of rooms of the hotel.
Restaurant was very much crowded. Tables were too much close to each other and feels uncomfortable sometimes. 

Anyway, it has a good sea view including a view of port city. 
Service levels can be improved. 

Overall it was a neutral experience and somewhat falls behind the expectation.",Family
Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,3,Disrespectful Travel Tourists,"It's a shame that a modern, beachfront hotel with privileged views has such terrible reception service.
Dear travelers like us, if you're arriving from anywhere in the world and want your room, we regret that the reception team doesn't take into consideration tourists like us who have traveled 15 hours just to shower and rest.
They only had rooms available for those who booked directly with them.
We've complained to Booking.com because they made us wait four hours almost until check-in time without any consideration.
A nice hotel is useless if the service and customer service are considered and disrespectful. We had to argue three times, and they are disrespectful, raising their voices and belittling tourists. We regret not recommending it due to the suggested treatment.",Couples
Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,2,Poor food quality,"The hotel is nice however the food is poor quality, I ordered food inside the hotel however the food was cold and could tell it was frozen. Breakfast has a good range however lots are always missing for example one they will have potatoes the next day they won’t have any, same with desserts which is a big let down. It’s a shame because it is a nice hotel however I would not recommend getting breakfast or ordering food it’s poor, there is a shop just down the road called Al - Mas which have quality fresh food always available and cheaper.",Family

The bedrooms were great with lovely bathrooms, bath and shower, great aircon and room service through out.",Couples
Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,5,Wonderful,"I like this new (opened May 2022), Japanese financed and influenced hotel, located on Marine Drive, right next to the sea with wonderful sweeping views of the ocean, port and city.   The rooms are great, and whilst they may appear modest in size, they are very reasonably proportioned and more like mini-suites with walls providing separate sleeping, washing, and clutter areas.   I really liked the smart Japanese toilet and the wide windows everywhere, from which to admire the view.  
The bathroom is big – almost the size of the main sleeping area – complete with a wonderful large open rainfall shower and wide (but quite short) bath.  
The outdoor pool at the top (27th floor) is sensational – possibly the best infinity pool I have swam in, see picture. 

The restaurant is located on the 10th floor, which is smart as it not only provides a great ocean view but reduces the pressure on the lifts. Breakfast is good although a surprise not to see real (pork) bacon which is available in other Colombo hotels.
There are, however, two downsides and one irritant.  The lifts are a big downside,  – there are only four and they are enough, especially at peak periods.  The lift is a “smart lift” so when you get in after having waited a while, it actually apologises to you for the wait – which means it also knows the wait is too long. 
The second problem is that the location it is too close, almost on top of, the local train station and whilst this is great if you are a train geek, its not so good if you enjoy sleeping in the morning.  On one side of the building, you can hear the platform announcements, and your room is in the direct blast of the train’s horn which will reverberate through the windows – you cannot sleep through it.   However, on the other side of the hotel (low last numbers xx01 – xx07), it’s a different story, much quieter.  As you may have guessed, I changed room and it was so much better. 
And the irritant – it’s the glow from the room temperature controls in the wall. These are fine in the daytime, but at night its too bright, necessitating a sleep mask on night one and an improvised piece of paper over the screen on night two.",Solo

Colombo,Granbell Hotel Colombo,4,"Great view, okay service","The room was as beautiful as the pictures, with a great view of the ocean and railway station down below. Unfortunately the bed was very stiff and uncomfortable.

The room and common areas including the gym, rooftop pool and jacuzzi were all very clean! Service at the rooftop was quick and helpful, staff even helped me take a bunch of pictures which is always appreciated as a solo traveller! Roomservice was also good.

Service at the front desk was so-so. As I arrived the employee commented on how heavy my bag looked but did not offer help. Check-in took quite some time and when I went down to ask for a bathrobe I was told to go back to the room and call housekeeping. 

When leaving I had ordered the airport shuttle, I asked staff where the car would pick me up and they only said ""downstairs"". Went downstairs, asked several cars and a bus if they were the shuttle but the weren't. Also asked the employees by the garage but they did not speak English and couldn't help me. Had to go back upstairs to the reception only to recieve the plate number. While the employee was on the phone with the driver I asked for the color of the car, but she didn't ask and once again I had to go outside looking for the car. Finally an employee from the reception walked with me to find the car.

I booked the shuttle and paid more than doube a Pickme to ensure a smooth and comfortable transit. If I had a do-over I would have booked a Pickme as this would have been quicker and cheaper.

All in all a good stay, but don't expect too much hospitality.",Solo

Negombo,Jetwing Lagoon Wellness,5,Body holiday amazing retreat,"The stay exceeded our expectations in every way. The resort is so tranquil,  the food is amazing,  the manorism of the the staff is out of this world, a total contrast to the attitude of most UK employees,  they literally can't do enough for you,  and their kind nature seems to come from the heart.

My Wife and I were treated by Nuwan and Sunetha in the Spa for the weeks duration. I have never met such peaceful and respectful people, what an amazing culture. 

Each morning we have traditional ayurvedic medicines and a consultation with the ayurvedic doctor, one of two doctors who are super friendly,  understanding and knowledgeable,  hey and guess what.....they don't kick you out after minutes,  you can converse with them for as long as you like and they tailor your days treated to suit , literally out of this world attitude to health and nutrition.  We now have both doctors WhatsApp details. The doctors literally could not believe how long it takes to get an appointment in the UK or that you can only have 5 minutes with a doctor per appointment.  The uk medical system needs a massive shake up

The attitude of the staff is the same throughout,  whether it is reception,  restaurant or kitchen,  everyone knows your name and room number. They always communicate between departments,  so if you book a tour,  they automatically adjust your meal time and treatment without you having to think about it.

The 100m pool is so clear and warm.

The room service is so quick and tidy

The food is next level flavoursome and super healthy.

Even security are friendly. 

Will definitely recommend to friends,  family and customers 😀",Couples

When I first came in to the hotel I asked them whether all three meals will be on buffet, then they said they cannot confirm it but we will be able to change it if needed from half board to full board. So I made a half board booking. Today when I came to know that today’s lunch too will be a buffet, so went to the front desk and informed them to change it to Full Board basis, they said ok. After an hours time like they says that there accounts department had informed them that we cannot change the meal plan. So I requested them that I would like to speak with the Manager, they said he would meet me in 5mins. I stayed for 15mins but the manager did not come but one lady who was in the reception comes and says that the Hotel cannot Change a meal plan from Half board to Full board as there accounts department informs them. A very bad experience in one of the best hotels where even the Manager cannot come and solve a simple situation such as this and keeping guests waiting outside their office. The very reason that we have come here over the years is the hotels reliability, which seems to be down the drain now.",Family

We did not require a fan or AC because of the chill weather, but the room heater was useful during the cold nights. Bed was comfortable, amenities were good and the bathroom was spacious and modern with plenty of hot water. 
Staff at every level were good, efficient, courteous and very friendly. A small issue with a plug point in the room was attended to efficiently. Frazer and his concierge crew were brilliant, he helped us find transport to visit some local attractions. Staff at the restaurant were also very nice and helpful.
Food was exceptional at breakfast and dinner with a wide variety in the buffets. There were many dishes not commonly found at Sri Lankan hotel buffets and they were uniformly tasty. 
Highlight for us was the live music by Trio Topaz on Saturday night. Beautiful music, variety of tunes and styles and warm personalities of musicians, plus an unexpected guest spot by Umara. 
Few points to improve though - replace plastic water bottles with reusable glass bottles in the rooms, provide a non-slip bath mat in the shower tub, improve water pressure in the shower and train restaurant serving staff to be more attentive to customers and talk less among themselves.

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,STUNNINGLY beautiful Heritance Kandomala. An absolute gem.,"Despite being 30 years old, this Hotel was truly an AMAZING experience. Designed by the famous Sri Lankan architect- Geoffrey Bawa, it was built into a rocky outcrop and as was typical of Geoffrey Bawa, nature was left undisturbed. It was beautiful, with great views from our room and had several pools - all beautifully appointed. A special call out to the lovely Apsara, who looked after our every need. But having said that, all the staff were exceptional. It was a handy place from which to view and visit Sigiriya.",Couples

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,A Truly Unforgettable Stay at  Kandalama,"From the moment we arrived at Heritance Kandalama, we felt completely at home. The hospitality we experienced was simply next level! A huge thank you to Ms. Apsara, who was with us every step of the way — from the moment we checked in until we checked out. She truly went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable, happy, and well looked after throughout our stay.

Mr. Sarath at the dining area was just as wonderful, always greeting us warmly and making sure we had everything we needed during every meal. The entire team made us feel genuinely cared for.

We stayed in both the Sigiriya Wing and Dambulla Wing, and each side had its own magic! If you’re a nature or wildlife lover, you will absolutely love the Sigiriya Wing. It’s surrounded by beautiful forest and feels like you’re part of nature itself. The Dambulla Wing, on the other hand, gave us breathtaking views of Kandalama Lake — a view we’ll never forget!

The food was absolutely delicious with a wide variety to choose from — every meal was a treat.

This was truly a memorable experience and we can't wait to come back! Thank you, Heritance Kandalama, for making our stay so special.",Couples

A special mention must go to the ever-charming Dunuki, who welcomed us so graciously and ensured everything was just right. She had our table ready in advance and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable throughout. Her friendly and attentive manner truly stood out and added a lovely personal touch to our experience.

We’d also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Chef Krishnakumar for the most mouth-watering mutton kottu we’ve ever tasted, along with the perfectly cooked hot butter calamari – both dishes were simply exquisite.

All in all, the warmth and professionalism of the staff at Heritance Kandalama made our visit unforgettable. We’re already looking forward to our next stay!",Family

He also shared with us the biological diversity around the hotel and the sustainability practices the hotel has done to preserve the environment. It's an absolute spectacle this hotel is.

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,You have to experience this place!!!,"Not one thing to fault here .. pure indulgence and the buffet .. omgosh!!!! You have never experienced anything like it I guarantee!

Monkeys have a cuppa with you in the morning. Squirrels are running around .. we even saw a mongoose and an elephant in the lake!",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Heritance Kandalama was stunning,"Heritance Kandalama was stunning - one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  It was architecturally impressive and clearly built with a great deal of environmental sensitivity.  The decor was stylish and facilities were amazing (choice of 4 pools) and several restaurants/ eating options.  Staff were helpful and very professional, the rooms were very comfortable but perhaps a little “underlit” in the main bedroom area.  They all had balconies and glass walls allowing a sense of immersion in the surrounding jungle.  Elephants were about and watching the monkeys climbing the foliage covering the exterior of the building was charming.",Solo

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Highly recommend,"Heritance Kandalama – A Masterpiece of Luxury & Nature
My stay at Heritance Kandalama was nothing short of extraordinary! Designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, this eco-luxury hotel blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, offering a breathtaking experience in the heart of Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle.

Location & Ambience
Perched on the edge of the Kandalama Lake, this stunning hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, rocky cliffs, and abundant wildlife. The architecture is a masterpiece—built into the mountainside, making it feel like an extension of nature itself. The views of Sigiriya Rock Fortress in the distance add to the magic of this place.

Rooms & Comfort
The rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and offer spectacular lake or jungle views. The floor-to-ceiling windows bring nature right into the room. I woke up to the sound of birds and the sight of monkeys playing in the trees outside my balcony. The luxurious bathroom with a rain shower and a deep bathtub made my stay even more relaxing.

Dining Experience
The buffet at Kanchana Restaurant was one of the best I’ve experienced, offering a mix of Sri Lankan and international cuisine. The quality of the food, fresh ingredients, and live cooking stations made every meal special. The rooftop dining experience with panoramic views of the lake was truly unforgettable.

Facilities & Activities
Infinity Pools – The iconic infinity pool overlooking the jungle and lake is breathtaking, perfect for a relaxing swim.

Ayurvedic Spa – A must-try! The treatments were rejuvenating, set in a serene environment.

Nature Walks & Bird Watching – The hotel is home to many bird species, making it ideal for nature lovers.

Cycling & Excursions – The hotel organizes tours to Sigiriya, Dambulla Cave Temple, and Minneriya National Park for wildlife safaris.

Service & Hospitality
The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. Every request was met with a smile, and their hospitality made me feel truly welcome.

Best Time to Visit
The hotel is beautiful year-round, but the dry season (May to September) is ideal for sightseeing and wildlife experiences.

Overall Verdict
⭐ 5/5 – Heritance Kandalama is not just a hotel; it’s an experience. Whether you’re looking for luxury, nature, or culture, this hotel offers it all. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sri Lanka!",Family
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,"Amazing hotel, fantastic food and gracious staff.","We stayed for seven nights at the Kandalama hotel. What an amazing place! The bedroom was roomy, cleaned daily  and the bed was very comfortable. The food was great with lots of different dishes  to choose from every day- I'm vegetarian and there was lots for me to choose from. There was masses for meat eaters too. 
All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly- nothing was too much trouble. Special thanks to Asanka and Modasanka who made sure our room was comfortable and clean- all the staff were gracious though, we just didnt catch their names!
 We tried all 3 swimming pools and found them all fab but would have appreciated some shaded areas around the poolside, but that is a small quibble as the ambience around all the pools was calm and peaceful-the views were good too. 
We really enjoyed seeing the monkeys ( macaques and langurs) from the balcony (and made sure to keep our balcony door locked when we were out as the macaques were very clever and determined little critters!).
We went on the jungle walk with Narinder, the resident naturalist and on another day took a tuk tuk to the Cave temples at Dambulla which are so beautiful. We also went to Pophams arboretum (near Dambulla) and thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. Just taking walks around the hotel and to the eco area  was enjoyable too.
We appreciated all the wildlife ( eg lizards, birds, butterflies) around the site and for us that was the 'icing on the cake' and ensured our stay gave us memories to last a lifetime.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Cooking class at Kandalama,"What a great experience. Our 2 young chefs did their employer proud. So pleasant and competent. Our own personal waiter made us feel like royalty.
The food produced was outstanding and we will be trying their hints as soon as we're home! Thanks Sudith for going out of his way to set this up for us",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,An extraordinary accomplishment,"An extraordinary accomplishment. This 7 floored building is deceptive as it sits quietly within the landscape. Unobtrusive yet magnificent in so many ways. Another splendid example of the brilliance of Sri Lankan architect, Geoffrey Bawa, whose designs were driven by a wish to sit a building within nature. Natural light and natural ventilation are found in general areas while the bedrooms have AC as required . The hotel is full of  furniture he designed which again displays an elegant simplicity.  There are 3 swimming pools all cleverly located including one which is built on a rock.",Family
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,“Jungle modernist “ accommodation at its best,Set into the jungle backdrop this hotel is a perfect example of Geoffrey Bawa architecture. When driving in on the narrow country road the hotel is not obvious until you are at the front door. We were on a tour of Bawa projects throughout Sri Lanka and this one is a must see!,Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,3,Architectural Masterpiece in Need of New Life,"The Heritance Kandalama is undeniably beautiful. Geoffrey Bawa’s architecture is nothing short of phenomenal and remains inspiring decades on. The setting and design are breathtaking, and the staff are consistently warm, helpful, and professional. The buffet is vibrant and full of variety, but unfortunately the set menu doesn’t quite live up to the same five-star promise.

However, as you spend time here, the hotel's age begins to show. Key areas feel tired, and despite the presence of other guests, the ambiance is surprisingly lifeless. The grand sculptural entrance leads to an empty café and a bar so underwhelming you might miss it altogether. What this hotel needs is a serious interior refresh and an injection of energy to match the brilliance of its architectural foundation. It's a place that deserves to feel as alive as it looks.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Unique experience,"A unique experience in this Geoffrey Bawa designed edifice. The hotel runs along the hillside and is open to the landscape: rock at the back, jungle and lake views to the front. A wide selection of foods at the buffet and attentive servers. Expect visits from monkeys on the balconies, but do not encourage as they are street wise thieves! We highly recommend a balloon flight; the launch site is a short drive away and the views as the sun rises spectacular.",Couples

Nuwara Eliya,The Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya - Heritage Grand,4,Truly a Grand Experience,"We stayed 3 nights in the Grand Hotel and as the name promises it is truly grand.

The grounds are nothing short of amazing and are the first thing you notice when you drive up to the hotel.

The reception staff were welcoming and this is where you start to get a taste of the old world charm of the hotel. It rambles over 3 wings and 3 floors with lots of different nooks and crannies all oozing charm.

The rooms were large and comfortable. Although  there is no air conditioning or fan it is not really needed in the cool climate.

There are quite a few eating options with the a large dining room buffet, separate Al a Carte restaurant, Thai (downstairs); and an Indian Restaurant and Cafe in the gardens. We tried the Indian , the  Al a Carte and the Cafe and found the food very good.

The only slight disappointment is the service staff at the Al a Carte and Breakfast Buffet. The service was okay but not what you would expect of a luxury hotel. At times the staff were often inattentive, missing in action or chatting to other staff. At breakfast only one waiter was serving tea and coffee in a very large dining room and I found I was not the only guest chasing a staff member down to try and get my coffee in the morning. This did not however detract much from our overall stay (just something for management to address)",Couples

I acknowledge that there was a “heritage clause” attached to this building but it had no fan, no Airconditioning and when we endeavoured to cool the room by opening a large casement window, our room filled with aggressive mosquitos.

Negombo,Jetwing Blue,1,Avoid this Property- Bad Hotel,"I checked in to Jetwings Blue at 2330 hours and the place looked haunted and poorly unkept. My notions were proved wrong when I woke next morning to find the room was wet because the balcony door was open and air con was on. Next 2 days were even worse - it rained heavily in Colombo and my room would get flooded with rain water because the balcony drain was blocked, rain water accumulated in balcony, the winds would blow water from below the doors into the room. Internet was marginal. Resturant food was below average. Lifts were poorly maintained. For the price the hotel charged the services were 3rd class. AVOID THIS PROPERTY.",Business
Negombo,Jetwing Blue,4,"Stunning main pool. Fabulous breakfast buffet, wonderful staff","Stunning main pool, The longest hotel breakfast  buffet I’ve seen and fabulous selection of choices . Large rooms but alas there was Mould in our shower which unfortunately does occur in tropical locations - and  the rattan blinds  in the bathroom Could have done with a wipe down . 
Internal staircase on the wing near room 228 needs better lighting as my husband tripped  on the top step  -rolling his ankle before walking down. This was advised to staff . 
But  the staff are wonderful . My husband developed tooth ache. They arranged a car , and dental  appointment .
I unfortunately left my reading glasses on the plane and front office staff phoned Sri Lankan airlines  for me but alas they weren’t found. 
We were there with my sister and her husband and 3 of us were celebrating birthdays. The pool staff made our pool time so enjoyable and big praise to Fernando who was fabulous

Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Best Hotel Stay!,"Our stay at Kandalama was amazing! The staff were so friendly and welcoming. Everyone from the front office to the managers, cleaners and restaurant staff, went above and beyond to ensure our stay at the hotel was special and memorable. Our daughters enjoyed the experience as much as we did. The choice of pools and indoor activities were great entertainment for kids.

Would highly recommend this stunning hotel to everyone looking for an amazing holiday! A huge Thank You to every staff member for helping make our holiday exceptional! We look forward to the next time we can be apart of this awesome experience again!",Family
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Heritance Kandalama brilliance,"We stayed three nights in a Luxury Room in the Sigiriya Wing. The Heritance Kandalama is a massive and incredibly unique hotel - over 900 metres from one end of the Dambulla wing to the other end of the Sigiriya wing. 

The hotel is incredibly popular with large tourist groups (coaches and coaches worth) so if you are planning to stay here, book very early. We had a lot of difficulty securing a room at the hotel and were unable to book directly as they were sold out. We secured a room via a third party site, but not the one we were hoping for. We were on the third floor and had a partial lake and Sigiriya view. 

We had an issue with our room upon arrival (despite at least five pre arrival emails to the hotel), however it was resolved quite quickly after check in. 

The rooms are dated, but very comfortable and with good amenities. Everything worked fine and the AC and the bedding were great. The different types of resident monkeys visited our balcony and outside our bathroom daily which we quite enjoyed. 

The property and gardens / landscaping are beautiful and extremely unique. The infinity pool has incredible views over the lake and towards Sigiriya and the rooftop pool with the base of the pool the bed rock the hotel is built on is extremely unique and very cool. 

As the hotel has so many tour groups, it is very busy early in the mornings and in the evening, but super quiet and peaceful during the day when they are out.

We did the half board option which is highly advisable considering the isolated lakeside location. Breakfast was great every day, even when very busy with a good range of options. Dinner was great the first night, however the quality and range of options was a little poor on the second and third nights. 

We arranged transport out to Sigiriya for sunrise and for an elephant safari through the hotel and both were fantastic with good quality drivers and vehicles.

We found all staff at the hotel absolutely exceptional and friendly. The hotel bar charges in rupees which makes drink prices quite reasonable. 

We would absolutely recommend the Heritance Kandalama and really enjoyed our stay.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Quality control is still great,"Visited this hotel after nearly 20 years and the quality was still great as expected.

Of course the thing that is most impressive is the staff ranging from the reception to bar staff to room staff to pool attendants. Also the friendliness and availability to talk and explain what and how they laquer the railings by the gentleman who was doing was greatly appreciated (he was doing around room 407 staircase at the time).

In short team Kandalama is the biggest asset this hotel has and I will definitely be visiting again when the opportunity presents itself.",Family
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,4,Pleasant stay Heritance Negombo,"Had a very pleasant stay at Heritance Negombo prior to joining an organised tour. Friendly and helpful staff, comfortable clean room. Beautiful swimming pool and a beach nearby. The buffet breakfast was extensive and fresh. The only downside are the large number of sqwaking crows that are constantly present ready to steel food.",Couples
Dambulla,Heritance Kandalama,5,Beautiful setting; extraordinary hotel,"Our stay at Heritance Kandalama was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka, and we left with a deep sense of appreciation for this unique and beautiful hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were in awe of the striking architecture—this hotel is truly one of the most beautiful buildings we’ve ever seen. Designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa, it is perfectly sympathetic to the surrounding forest, blending seamlessly with nature and offering breathtaking views at every turn.

The food at Heritance Kandalama was amazing—a brilliant buffet. The variety was exceptional, and the quality was even better. We particularly loved the hoppers, daal, and the delicious selection of breads and fruits. There were also plenty of international food options for those who wanted them, ensuring that everyone’s tastes were satisfied. Every meal felt like a treat, and we enjoyed trying the local specialties every day.

The hotel’s three pools were a highlight, with the infinity pool offering the most breathtaking views of the nearby lake. It was the perfect place to unwind and take in the serene, peaceful surroundings. The entire hotel felt like an oasis—lush, beautiful, and incredibly calming. We spent time relaxing by the pools, soaking in the views, and enjoying the natural beauty all around us.

The nature surrounding the hotel is extraordinary. We loved watching the monkeys play and observing the wild birds that seemed to be everywhere. The sounds of the forest added a peaceful ambiance, making it easy to relax and feel truly connected to the environment. And the sunsets! They were simply incredible, casting a golden glow over the lake and the forest, creating a memory we’ll cherish forever.

The service at Heritance Kandalama was another standout feature. The staff were brilliant—professional, friendly, and attentive. They clearly take pride in their work and are great ambassadors for the hotel. This was our first experience of Sri Lanka, and we couldn’t have been made to feel more welcome. The staff were not only helpful but also genuinely interested in us, always going the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and their warm hospitality made our stay even more memorable.

We also had the privilege of experiencing some incredible nearby attractions. One of the standout experiences was walking with a monk. This meditation experience, where we visited caves and received the monk’s wisdom on the side of a mountain, was truly moving. It was a privilege to be in such a breathtaking setting and learn about Sri Lankan culture and spirituality.

We also climbed Sigiriya and Pidurangala, both of which were unmissable. While the sites can be crowded, the views from the top, especially at sunset, were absolutely worth it. The Dambulla caves, with their ancient and solemn atmosphere, made us feel like we were stepping back in time. The sense of history surrounding us was palpable, and we felt privileged to visit these sacred places.

Overall, Heritance Kandalama provided the perfect setting for a peaceful retreat—luxurious, connected to nature, and full of exceptional experiences. The combination of striking design, amazing food, brilliant service, and the chance to connect with nature made this stay unforgettable. We absolutely loved every moment and can’t wait to return.

The location is perfect, right by the sea and close to the city’s major attractions. My sea-view room was spacious and spotless, with a large bathtub. The hotel is modern, cozy, and very clean. The highlight was the infinity pool and jacuzzi on the 27th floor, offering stunning views of the city and ocean. Staff were incredibly friendly and reflected true Sri Lankan hospitality. The buffet dinner was delicious, especially the Sri Lankan dishes. Although there is nothing really negative about my stay, the pool area is small with limited sunbeds, and the Japanese restaurant is a bit pricey due to added taxes. Overall, a memorable stay and highly recommended to anyone visiting Colombo.",Solo

The surrounding area is a bit grim so we dined in at the buffet, extraordinary selection and presentation turned out to be great value. Breakfast again a large selection but chaotic with cramped tables and a large school group of teens, picking up food by hands. It’s a large hotel and big numbers of guests I guess. Again another rooftop pool and Sri Lankan sunset.",Family

Unawatuna,Araliya Beach Resort & Spa,4,"Pleasant Stay with Outstanding Staff, But Disappointing Food","Pleasant Stay with Outstanding Staff, But Disappointing Food

The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff were truly exceptional. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to outstanding service. Elwin helped us with the check-in process and graciously gave us a tour of the property, including the charming herb garden and a visit to the rooftop—just in time to witness a stunning sunset.

Unfortunately, the dining experience fell well below expectations. We had booked a half-board package, but after trying the dinner buffet on the first night, we chose to dine elsewhere at our own expense for the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was equally underwhelming—disappointingly, even a simple omelette wasn’t prepared well. We struggled to find a single dish that was enjoyable at either meal.

While the hospitality and overall ambiance deserve high praise, the quality of the food significantly detracted from our experience. I sincerely hope management addresses this issue, as it prevents an otherwise excellent hotel from earning a full five stars.",Family

From food to rooms, everything was top notch, well served and arranged. The property is absolutely spectacular, serene and spacious. It’s incredible for a peaceful vacation and I would absolutely go again with my family. Travelling from Colombo to Dambulla was a little exhausting, but arriving at Jetwing Lake made it all worth it.",Family
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"Perfect blend of luxury and nature, with warm, attentive service and delicious food","We had a wonderful stay at Jetwing Lake – the service was exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff who made us feel genuinely welcome throughout. The food was a real highlight, offering a wide variety of both local and international dishes that were fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

The hotel’s setting was absolutely breathtaking, nestled beside the serene Siyahala Lake and surrounded by lush greenery, which created a peaceful and calming atmosphere. From the spacious, well-designed rooms to the tranquil infinity pool and stunning views, everything about this 5-star property made our stay feel truly special and relaxing.",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,1,Deeply Troubling Incident!,"It has taken me a month to write this review, as my experience at Jetwing Lake has left me deeply traumatized and overshadowed my first Sri Lanka trip. I hesitated to share this out of embarrassment, but I believe it’s important for future guests to be aware, especially solo female travelers or groups of women.

During my stay, while I was in the shower, a male housekeeping staff member entered my room. Despite the unmistakable sound of running water, he proceeded to go deeper into the room and look through the clear glass door, seeing me in a state of complete vulnerability. It was extremely evident that someone was in the shower, but he wanted to look anyway. The sense of violation and trauma I felt in that moment is hard to put into words. I wanted to leave immediately, but it was our last night there so I just told myself to get through this one night.

The hotel’s initial response was wholly inadequate. They offered to comp our dinner and “upgrade” me to a similar room with a larger balcony and better view, as if that could somehow rectify what had happened. It wasn’t until after my tour agent intervened did the hotel refund the full cost of my stay.

The follow-up correspondence from the hotel’s General Manager included the usual assurances: that this was an isolated incident, and that staff training would be improved. While I truly hope they follow through on these promises, I feel that basic staff protocols, such as not entering a room when someone is in the shower, should not require additional training. They are common sense. Please, do better.",Couples

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,Great place to stay with amazing staff!!,"I travelled to Sri Lanka on a small group tour with Intrepid and this was my first real introduction to Sri Lankan and their wonderful hospitality.

The hotel is big but it manages to keep a very personal approach to the clientele and, as with most of Sri Lanka, you are greeted by friendly staff with huge smiles!!  Our group were accommodated in rooms away from the main building which are spacious and well equipped.  Because some of them are quite a walk from the main building there is a fabulous service where you are taken to and collected from your room.  The walk  to the rooms is a pleasant one past the lake and through the trees where you will see many birds and small animals but after a long day sightseeing the lift to your room is very welcome!!

I was  unwell one day and stayed at the hotel and was visited 4 times (!!!) by 2 different doctors.  The attention I had was amazing.  After leaving the hotel I had messages from the female doctor, Iranga, asking if I was better and enjoying my holiday.  The Reception Manager, Imalka, who always came to the room to see me with the doctor, also text me during the rest of my trip to ask if I was ok and enjoying the trip.  Amazing and thank you to them both!!!!  Your kindness will never be forgotten.

Rooms were serviced well, the food was good, the location was stunning and very convenient for visiting all the various sights in the area and all the staff were truly exceptional.  

Thank you Jetwing Lake for a great stay.",Solo

Tangalle,Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort,5,5 Star experience,"We stayed at the Anantara for 8 nights following 2 weeks of travelling and staying in various places in Sri Lanka.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Sri Lanka but what really did make it special were the Sri Lankan people themselves and nowhere epitomised this more than at the Anantara.All the staff from those working on the grounds through cleaners,restaurant staff to front of house were friendly,helpful and usually happy to engage in conversation.You are made to feel especially welcome when dining at Journeys where we enjoyed chatting with Tachila,Thisari and others,often fairly new staff but very pleased to be working there.The manager of the pool bar,Greshan,was probably the nicest person we met in Sri Lanka and his story of surviving the tsunami we will never forget,thanks for the G&T’s!Likewise to the ‘beach boys’ Nuwan,Heshan and others who ensured our place on the grass for sundowners and just couldn’t stop smiling and laughing.Great guys.Front of house was Thisal who was at the end of all our WhatsApp’s sorting out laundry,drinks and every other request.Thanks
The grounds are immaculately kept with people sweeping from sunrise to sunset and contain many different trees,shrubs and plants as well as animals and birds,well worth taking a closer look at to appreciate.Don’t miss the man who climbs the impossibly high palm trees with just a bit of rope between his feet,chopping down coconuts.
The whole complex sweeps close to the shoreline and is bookended by the Il Mare Italian style restaurant high up overlooking the cliffs and wonderful on an evening to Verala Asian themed restaurant shaped to mimic 2 coconut shells and very impressive.We ate there 3 times and were expertly looked after by Rizvi enjoying watching the chefs with their clanging blades making the kotthu or other specials.
The beach in front of the hotel can be challenging to swim in and not for the inexperienced but the adjacent public beach Goyambaku is safer but still great fun for bodyboarding.
Our all inclusive package allowed us a one hour spa treatment which is very classy and we also enjoyed the high tea experience.I wanted to try a surfing lesson and the hotel have a company called Tropic surf which is located on site and run by Shaun and Lainey which take you to a safe and quiet beach some 20 minutes away by tuktuk.Great fun,very tiring but no good if you’re 63 and unfit!

Tangalle,Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort,5,A Long Overdue Note of Heartfelt Gratitude,"Dear Anantara Peace Haven Team,

There are places you visit... and then there are places that live on in your heart long after the journey ends. My stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle was, without a doubt, one of the latter—a soul-soothing, heartwarming experience that lingered well beyond the check-out date.

Please forgive the delay in sending this note; due to the whirlwind of a demanding schedule, I was unable to share my reflections sooner. Yet not a single day has passed without fond memories rising gently to the surface—the sound of waves echoing through the palms, the taste of spice-laced southern cuisine, and the unforgettable warmth of your team’s hospitality.

From the very first moment I arrived, I was enveloped in a sense of serenity and grace. The resort didn’t just meet expectations—it quietly, elegantly redefined them. There’s a rare kind of magic at Anantara Peace Haven—one that lies not only in its sweeping views of the Indian Ocean or its lush, fragrant gardens, but in its people. It is your team that turns luxury into something profoundly human.

I must extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Ms. Thisari Nawoda, whose leadership and attentiveness infused every element of my stay. Ms. Thisari is not only a consummate professional but also a true ambassador of Sri Lankan hospitality. Her ability to anticipate needs, resolve requests with poise, and engage guests with genuine warmth is a gift few possess. It was clear to me that she doesn't just manage a resort—she nurtures an experience. Her quiet presence seemed to ripple through the team, creating an atmosphere of calm attentiveness and joy.

To the incredible staff, whose names I wish I had written down one by one, you each made me feel as though I were the only guest on the property. From the gentle housekeepers who maintained my villa with care and respect, to the smiling faces at breakfast who remembered my coffee preferences without being told twice, every detail felt personal. Not scripted, not rehearsed—real.

What truly stood out was the flexibility and thoughtfulness offered during my stay. Despite arriving with a somewhat unpredictable schedule and changing needs, your team never once made me feel like an inconvenience. Whether it was adapting meal times, arranging transport at odd hours, or simply offering a quiet space for me to catch my breath, your collective grace was unwavering.

The villa itself—an oasis of comfort—was designed not just to impress, but to restore. The harmony between refined architecture and natural beauty created a space that felt both elevated and grounding. Every sunrise I watched from that private terrace was like a quiet promise that all would be well.

And the cuisine... what a journey that was! Each meal was a celebration—vibrant, soulful, rooted in the local soil yet layered with creativity. Your chefs are not merely cooks; they are storytellers, serving chapters of southern Sri Lanka on every plate. I felt nourished not only in body, but in spirit.

As I look back, what touches me most is that Anantara Peace Haven never tried to “impress” in the way many luxury resorts often do. Instead, you chose to connect—to the guest, to the land, to the moment. And that is where your true magic lies.

Please accept my sincerest thanks, not just for the unforgettable stay, but for the way you made me feel—seen, cared for, and at peace.

To Ms. Thisari Nawoda and every team member whose efforts made my stay so special, thank you. I carry your kindness with me.",Family

Staff are attentive with immaculate uniforms and always helpful.
R. Thanushan in the Hethersett Bar went over and above with his service.
Pathmaraj has been with the Heritance for 29 years and gave us a wonderful tour of the gardens under his control.
Absolutely immaculate.

I had the pleasure of staying at Cinnamon Red, and I must say that it truly exemplifies the best of Sri Lankan hospitality.

The hotel’s central location in the heart of Colombo made it incredibly convenient for exploring the city, yet it still felt like a peaceful retreat after a long day.

A special mention goes to Thiloka at the front desk. Her helpfulness, knowledge, and genuine understanding of guest relations were simply outstanding. She went above and beyond to ensure my stay was as comfortable as possible, providing excellent recommendations and handling every request with grace and professionalism.

Colombo,Cinnamon Red Colombo,1,Poor customer service,Went to Flavored restaurant for dinner buffet 25th June. We booked in advance and paid half of the total cost to book a table for 10. When we went restaurant was packed and we didn’t have a table reserved!! Waiters there said another group sat on our already reserved table so they will prepare another table and give us. The whole concept of reservation is that customers don’t have to wait. Eranga who came to us with a massive attitude saying why can’t you’ll wait for 5 minutes and asked me not to make a scene and keep quiet. Very disappointed about the customer service and how we were treated when it’s their fault not reserving a table after paying for it. Management should train their staff on how to talk to customers.

Colombo,Cinnamon Red Colombo,5,A Memorable Stay at Cinnamon Red – Thanks to a Remarkable Employee,"During my week long stay at Cinnamon Red Colombo in mid June, I was in the city to attend a series of meetings and a workshop. As someone who makes it a habit to catch up on both national and international news each day, having access to television news is an essential part of my routine no matter where I am.

On the second morning of my stay, I realized that the television in my room wasn’t functioning properly, likely due to poor signal caused by the rainy weather in Colombo. While it was an understandable issue given the conditions, I hoped it could be resolved.

That’s when I met Mr. Gayan, the room boy assigned to the 20th floor, where I was staying. From the very beginning, Mr. Gayan left a positive impression. On my first day, he greeted me warmly in the morning, checked in to see if the room was in order, and made me feel genuinely welcome.

The following day, I happened to see him near the lift and casually mentioned the issue with the TV. Without hesitation and without needing any technical support, Mr. Gayan came to my room and quickly fixed the problem. I was truly impressed by his initiative, skill, and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure guests have a comfortable experience.

It was in that moment I realized how talented and multi-skilled the staff at Cinnamon Red truly are. Mr. Gayan is a shining example of hospitality done right a professional who not only understands his role but embodies the values of care, efficiency, and excellence.

Overall, my stay at Cinnamon Red was truly enjoyable. The food was exceptional, the ambience was refreshing, and above all, the staff were remarkably attentive and genuinely kind. Thanks to people like Mr. Gayan, my stay became a truly memorable one.",Solo

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with grace and warmth. The resort is breathtaking — surrounded by nature, beautifully landscaped, and set against the backdrop of the stunning southern coastline. It offered the perfect balance of luxury, tranquility, and Sri Lankan charm.

Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,3,Good for a short stay,"We had an overall nice stay at the Shangri-la Hambantota. The facilitates are lovely and the sunset pool was great for us as a couple, however as this is the adult pool maybe more policing is needed. The room was nice however we did have a small critter problem with a large insect found in the bed and quite a few insects around the room. 

We were staying over the Sri Lankan New Year which the hotel had on events for, this led to the hotel being very busy and might have caused some of the problems we faced such as a lack of service (waiting a very long time for drinks and meals, along with the problems from housekeeping). We booked day trips through the hotel which were good however overpriced and the day tours were just drivers and whilst friendly enough were not particularly knowledgeable about where we were going and maybe a lack of communication between the hotel and drivers along with rather over-enthusiastic descriptions of the trips. 

The hotel recommended a city tour of Hambantota which consisted of the botanical gardens and bird zoo which we were unaware of, we had to pay 4,500 as foreigners for the bird zoo, which turned out to be birds in small cages - we did not enjoy this. The driver then told us the botanical gardens had a long wait time and he didn’t recommend it, so we paid $60 to be driven to two locations only 15 minutes away, one of which was very disappointing. 

The food was average, as a vegetarian there was a lack of options to choose from at some of the restaurants, however a good dinner buffet selection. The Sera is quite overpriced especially considering the quality of food we received. 

The grounds are beautifully maintained and the safaris are worthwhile as there is fantastic nature. I would recommend as a short stay for the safaris.",Couples

Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,3,Red Flag for vegetarians,"The property is good and well maintained...
We booked a suite category room with an ocean view and the disappointment began there...the ocean from our room was barely visible...and upon frequent calls n discussions they gave another room just above the room provided...now what we can see is a trace of ocean n that too at a distance...
Also it was located at a noisy place near the pool, we wanted a peaceful place to reside in...so we had to adjust in the room which 
1. Does not offer an ocean view 
2 located at a noisy place...
The image updated on the website, does not match the room we checked in...

As it was a vacation, we let it go as we didn't want to spoil our mood. 
We are vegetarians and mentioned that at the time of booking and check in. If a 5 star property is accepting bookings for vegetarians then they should make proper arrangements for the Indian vegetarian guests... unfortunately their Indian chef was on leave and we could not find anything on the menu that can be eaten by us, except a cheese pizza..
One night for dinner we had that barely as we are not pizza lovers, second night we again got a pizza but it came 45 min post giving na order n that too very cold as if someone forgot to serve it...
 The food was the biggest challenge in the hotel, it is at a remote location so a tuk tuk or a cab does not come easily. The hotel charges hefty if we book a car through them. Hospitality and service is 0 especially at restaurants. 
What one expects from a hotel, a classy room with a great view, good food and hospitality, especially when you book a higher category rooms, which charges 30k-35k INR per night. 

The hotel is well maintained and made considering families in mind but for people looking expecting such things out of a vacation can reconsider before booking this",Family
Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,1,Extremely Disappointing Stay – Arrogant Management & Substandard Service,"Our experience at Shangri-La Hambantota was far from what one expects from a luxury resort and left us with a lasting sense of frustration and disbelief.
We were travelling with young children after a 12-hour journey, hoping for a smooth and welcoming check-in. Instead, we were met with one of the most disorganized and poorly managed check-ins we’ve ever encountered. Despite informing the hotel in advance and requesting an expedited process, there was simply no manpower or urgency from the staff. Mr. Kamindu at the front desk was completely clueless and indifferent, showing little regard for basic hospitality. When we requested an upgrade, he first claimed there was no availability and moments later said upgrades were available for a price—an inconsistency that spoke volumes about their priorities.
The rooms allocated to us were at the very end of a long corridor, at least a 5-minute walk from the lobby—highly inconvenient for a family with small kids. Worse, the rooms were in noticeably poor condition and in no way reflected five-star quality.
When we raised these concerns with the duty manager, Mr. Lakmal, the situation only deteriorated. Instead of listening or showing any sense of accountability, he was rude, dismissive, and shockingly arrogant. He refused to help, refused to acknowledge the genuine concern of accessibility for a family with children, and instead blamed us for not requesting a “more convenient room” at the time of booking. He even had the audacity to suggest we pay for a higher category room if we wanted basic convenience.
It was a masterclass in how not to handle guest issues. Mr. Lakmal’s attitude was not just unprofessional—it was shameful for someone representing a global hospitality brand. Basic courtesy, empathy, and common sense were completely absent.
This experience has not only left us disappointed but also deeply disillusioned with the Shangri-La brand. What should have been a relaxing family getaway was marred by sheer negligence, apathy, and arrogance from key staff.",Family

Nuwara Eliya,The Golden Ridge Hotel,5,Exceptional Stay at Golden Ridge – Truly Memorable!,"We had an unexpected change in plans when our original online booking elsewhere fell through, but walking into Golden Ridge in Nuwara Eliya turned out to be the best decision we made. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed, and the manager, Ausha,  went above and beyond to make us feel at home.

This newly built hotel is spacious, impeccably clean, and beautifully maintained. The entire staff was friendly, professional, and committed to providing top-notch service throughout our stay.

The food was outstanding offering a variety of high-quality, multi-ethnic dishes that catered to all our tastes. The **gym and swimming pool** were well-equipped and added to the relaxing and enjoyable experience.

As a family, we thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay, and without a doubt, we’ll be returning here on our next visit to Nuwara Eliya  Highly recommended!",Family
Nuwara Eliya,The Golden Ridge Hotel,5,A very comfortable and  luxurious stay with very amicable staff arounf,This has been one of the best experiences that I’ve ever had in any holiday .

The information provided by them is very helpful . The desk staff is very friendly specially ms. dilrukshi as overall the experience was great,Family
Nuwara Eliya,The Golden Ridge Hotel,5,Happy Holiday,"We had a truly wonderful experience during our stay at Golden Ridge Nuwara Eliya in April . From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome and went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable throughout our stay. We had an issue with the room and Dilrukshi at  the front office sorted the issue and changed our room to ensure we were happy. Heshan also made great effort in assisting us in room change and was so helpful. 

The team at the front desk was exceptional, especially Dilrukshi, Heshan, Nuran,Natasha and Sandurukan , who were always friendly, professional, and ready to assist with anything we needed. Their warm hospitality made a big difference to our experience.

We were equally impressed with the restaurant staff. Manoj, Chamith, Sampa, Imandi and Mani the chef, and the rest of the team provided excellent service every day. Always attentive, courteous, and happy to accommodate. The food was delicious, with a good range of options and fresh, flavourful ingredients.

We may have forgotten some names ...Everyone  made our stay memorable. Their kindness and care made us feel at home.

Thank you to everyone at Golden Ridge. 

Warm regards,

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Excellent stay,"I recently stayed at Riu and had a fantastic experience! The staff were warm and welcoming, the room was clean and comfortable, and the amenities were top-notch. The hotel's location was perfect, close to local attractions and with great views. I especially appreciated the delicious food and friendly service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Ahungalla. Overall, a great value for the price and a wonderful stay!"" 5/5 stars.",None
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,"Great people on the ground, needing upper echelon support!","We returned home on 13 January, after a 4 night stay in Dubai, following a 30-night booking, mirroring a similar holiday period here over Christmas 2023 and the New Year, when I reviewed both the hotel facilities and the staff as being outstanding in their support of my wife who is disabled, following a stroke almost 5 years ago, and me in my efforts to support her. In general, THAT OPINION HAS NOT CHANGED! 

The service provided by the entire staff, from Housekeeping, Dining, Bar, Pool and Reception right up to the senior management has, once again, been outstanding, so whilst not wishing to ignore any of those people, I will say a very sincere personal ""Thank you"" to Lahiru and Keshara, together with those other members of the Housekeeping Team, who went the extra mile to maintain our large suite (TY also for the upgrade!), at the earliest opportunity when I took my wife out onto the balcony to clear the room. I must also add my thanks to Receptionist Nadee, who actively helped throughout both our stays to date, and in my planning of this second stay, and for taking the time to talk directly to my wife at every opportunity to ensure that she was being well looked after by the whole team.

Notwithstanding all that effort, the overall management of our holiday by Riu Head Office (HO) turned into a farce. First off, our Emirates flight from Birmingham UK was cancelled following a heavy landing by the arriving EK39, so we were provided with hotel accommodation overnight and flew on EK40 the following day. As soon as I knew that we were not flying as scheduled, I contacted Riu HO and advised them of the delay.

Unfortunately, when we finally got to Sri Lanka, I discovered that our Riu HO booked transfer had not been rescheduled; indeed, I learned later that the taxi for our original arrival had waited on time and we had been logged as a ""no show"". After almost 3 hrs waiting in the Arrivals area of the airport, the hotel staff kindly sorted a replacement transfer, so we arrived at the hotel well over a day late.

With our previous stay in mind, and a further kind upgrade to exactly the same suite which has a large sea- and pool-facing L-shaped balcony,  I asked for the pool staff to provide a beach bed on the balcony, to allow my wife to relax without having to negotiate the other guests around the pool area. I was rather surprised to hear that it wasn't now Riu HO policy for beds to be used on guests’ balconies, regardless of personal circumstances! 

As a company based in the European Union, I am sure that Riu must be aware of the need to acknowledge Disability and Accessibility legislation, so it seems petty that they cannot address a simple topic such as this on a case by case basis. Might I suggest that the simple expedient of providing a bed to any disabled guest is unlikely to cause any adverse comment from the rest of the guest population!

With my second 30 night stay, I have now become a Riu Diamond Class member, and have already booked a Summer stay with the Company in Cape Verde - let's hope that commonsense (if not the required duty-of-care!) prevails, and that we can gets the cooperation that my wife's condition warrants.

!n the meantime, my sincere thanks and best wishes for the future for all of you at the Riu Sri Lanka, and we do hope to see you all again soon💕😎👍

PS  I won't say how, as I do not want to indicate who was involved, but the difficulty was put to bed!",Couples
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,3,Kids love it!,"What I love most about the place is that my kids enjoy the pools very much. This is my second visit to RIU. However, I wish the food was better. My husband and I felt that the standard of food had gone down from our previous visit the year before. 

We dined at the Italian restaurant and it was quite disappointing. So it was the food that let me down but everything else was nice and pleasant. 

But I will visit RIU again simply cos it’s a lovely place to relax as a family. Hope the food will improve.",None

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,2,"Disappointing, overpriced  and misleading","We were left extremely disappointed with our experience here.
Please be aware that the ‘24 hour all inclusive’ offer is misleading- only one restaurant was open the night we went and the ‘all night’ restaurant consisted of a small cafe with left over dry sandwiches and pasta.

The dinner buffet at Rita Panna was terrible. Every single food item we tried was tasteless and bland. Even basic food such as calamari were chewy and overcooked. Moreover, there were flies circling the buffet food and staff took no interest when we pointed this out.

The staff were friendly, however the ambience was bizarre for a 5 star hotel.. we were surrounded by clowns and waiters in dress up costumes, we well amateur dancers in the dining area. This would be expected in a family style cruise ship, not a ‘5 star’ hotel. 
Staff were also constantly mopping and sweeping throughout the restaurant whilst we were dining.

The hotel is also catered towards Russian tourists. It felt like we were in a pub full of rowdy, drunk people; not a relaxing sea side resort.

On a positive note, the rooms were clean and spacious. And our request to check out the night we arrived due to our dissatisfaction was met by the hotel manager.",Family
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Definitely a bucket list holiday,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Riu. We went in June when is low season, but the weather was good, rained only in the evening or very short time during the day, we still had plenty sunny hot days by the pool. Staff were very attentive and food was good.
We had few excursions, but with local guides who you can find outside hotel gate by the beach.
I highly recommend to look for Eshan. They are doing private tours for your group only, very attentive, and you see a lot more with them than TUI!
I honestly do not recommend TUI over local tour guides. And they are cheaper!
Eshan really made our trips magical!",Friends
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,2,Kind of worrying,"I made a complaint about our room being entered at 02.00 and was banded around. Tried to raise concerns with carrier and RIU. Absolutely no satisfaction. No reason given as to why two members of maintenance entered our room, in the middle of the night. 
Think they thought we were out of the room  or perhaps as maintenance could access our safe. 
Why would management not give a reason, for this  event. 
Asked, but told they could not answer our questions 
Kind of worrying 
Will not stay with RIU again.",Couples

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,"Amazing country, hotel and experience!!!!","We have just returned from Sri Lanka where we stayed at the RUI hotel, we are a family with 3 young children and the hotel was great value.
The food was exceptional for an all inclusive and snacks were constantly available outside of normal meal times with amazing cocktails, beer and wine available practically 24/7.  
The facilities are amazing for children with a kids club catering for 4-12 year olds which our 3 loved and was ran by the lovely Madu who kept them entertained with crafting and games. There were also children's shows and discos in the early evenings. 
There are 3 pools, one for only adults with a swim up bar and a further children's pool with slides and waterfalls. 
The buffet food was amazing and a selection of local, and international with a noodle bar and Italian counter and a carvery with amazing selection of fruits and puddings at each sitting and wine, beer and soft drinks available at mealtimes with our glasses being topped up by the excellent Roshan and Sameera.  Our family was also made to feel special by Marshall who always took the time to make sure we had a table and were well taken care of.
our room was a family suite which was spacious with two twin beds and a large double with two bathrooms with a bath and walk in shower.  It was kept impeccably clean by our lovely cleaner Mayura who delighted the children every day with different towel animals.   
On our final day we were also granted a late checkout for free which was a nice touch. 
The hotel can get quite crowded on the weekends when many locals come to stay but this did not diminish our enjoyment and the only other minor point is all the floors in the hotel tend to be quite slippy which was a bit of a problem for my wife who was walking round on crutches after a knee injury. 
We did several trips while we were there, all organised by a tourist guide, Kamal, who is located at a stall outside the entrance to the beach.  He was much cheaper than many of the other tours offered and we had several amazing trips to buddhist temples, tea plantations, turtle sanctuaries and river safaris and he took great care our us and the children.  He can be contacted on 0094777-072608 and i would thoroughly recommend him for any trips. 
Finally there are shows every evening by the entertainment team which varied from local dancing to a rendition of grease!!!! and many local bands performing really good covers of popular songs.  
All in all the country of Sri Lanka was amazing with welcoming and friendly people and amazing sights and the hotel did not disappoint at all, I  would return there in an instant.",Family

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Riu Ahungalla,We had chosen the RIU at Ahungalla for our annual trip. There were 23 adults and 10 kids in our group. Checking was lil bit hard cause the pax was large. But overall experience was great. We didn’t tried out the Japanese and Italian restaurants and spa n others. But we had enjoyed the live musics in the night and the club.

Negombo,Sentido Heritance Negombo,4,Perfect But For Lack of Sun Loungers,"The only reason I am rating this hotel 4 instead of 5 is due to the lack of sun loungers around the stunning pool and gardens.  It's the most magnificent area, with plenty of shade, but during our stay they had moved chairs to allow you to at least sit, but we were there to relax after a week of nonstop sightseeing in Sri Lanka, so sitting upright in a chair was not the plan.  That said, our room was wonderful with a fabulous bathroom and stunning sea view.   The hotel is fresh and modern and from the marvellous welcome at Reception on arrival to the friendly efficient staff in the Restaurant we loved this hotel.  We opted for the Half Board deal and were delighted with the extensive buffet breakfast, with live cooking stations for eggs & hoppers and fresh juices etc.  Dinner was Table Service (which we loved) chosen from a Menu to suit all tastes each night, beautifully presented by excellent Servers.  We really enjoyed the Bar for pre-dinner drinks with its relaxed atmosphere, floor to ceiling windows and sofa with footstools seating facing out to sea.  There is a very nice well maintained gym, restaurants connected to the hotel just opposite and is situated perfectly for sightseeing should you be able to tear yourself away from the pool!",Couples

There are so many others that I can’t recall the names of, such as the individuals from the Spa, or from the restaurants or from the shops. But everyone was amazing to us.

Nuwara Eliya,Heritance Tea Factory,5,Tea and History,"This hotel is unique - a colonial era tea factory painstakingly converted into a hotel.  The common spaces are fantastic with many factory details left in tact.  While the rooms are slightly dated and could benefit from more power outlets, they had to fit hotel rooms into a tea factory.   The views are spectacular and as an added bonus, the grounds are still a working tea plantation.  Most meals are buffet style - we were happy with the selection, though a bit more fresh fruit would have been appreciated.  The staff are kind and helpful.  

The area itself does not have a lot of attractions, so you need to know where you are going and why.  If you like rolling hills, serenity, and tea (emphasis on tea), you will love this place.  If you are looking for action and/or lots of activities, this may not be the place.  

We were looking for the former, and Heritance Tea Factory excelled in all aspects.",Couples

Krishna who showed us round the tea factory on the hotel grounds and Mohanraj who was on the front door and we had a lovely chat with. 
I cannot recommend the evening meal enough in the railway carriage which was such a lovely experience. The food was superb. The conductor and chef were  lovely and so friendly and helpful. It is well worth every penny the standard and presentation of the food was incredible. We also enjoyed the buffet one night and the live singing. 
Would highly recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a winding road up to it but well worth it for the views and the temperature is definitely a bit cooler here.",Couples
Nuwara Eliya,Heritance Tea Factory,5,Stepping back in time,"Heritance Tea Factory was like stepping back in time to the era of wonderful travel and accommodation.

The service and staff were outstanding - something not often seen in the modern era. The staff were all so proud of their service; polite; extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the history of the Tea Factory. It was like stepping back in time 100 years and we truely loved the experience. 
Turndown service was memorable and the effort to craft an elephant from towels was very special from our floor room boy Jayapraka. 
Sleeping with the windows opened and hearing only little birds twittering outside was truly special in a fast and noisy modern world.

Absolutely amazing place! Beautiful views, stunning architectural conversion from a factory to a 5 star hotel (retaining a lot of the original industrial fittings - I loved it!).
Room and bathroom were very nice (bed was hard). Only complaint - no air con, only a very noisy ceiling fan. I know it's cooler in the mountains, but it was still warm (luckily, the windows opened and there was a cool breeze).
Food was very good (try the muesli, absolutely delicious!) and the staff were great.
Absolutely loved my (way too short) stay here.",Friends

The Highlands area is everything we hoped for, and the Heritance Tea Factory provided us with the absolutely premium location and experience.
Not only did we get to visit the onsite organic tea factory and fields, but the original engineering is in place, and running, which thrilled my husband!
We had the most magical wedding anniversary, including a gastronomic experience onboard the  TCK6685 classic railway carriage, complete with Conductor, personal Chef and live music, and a surprise cake just for us! The train even moves! Worth every £ for the evening!
A massage and whole body cleanse in the Spa, given by the wonderful Ari, was heaven sent.
The hotel rooms are beautiful,  converted tea factory spaces; extremely opulent and a great two nights sleep.
The Gardener gave us a personal tour of the English garden, which was perfect. There are plenty of hiking, tea picking and other activities on offer.
The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us but we’d personally give a shout out to Sivakumar, the restaurant staff, especially the Manager, and our Room Man, Sajeeshan. Thank you for the best tea experience ever!",Couples

Our family had been traveling quite a bit, so we were looking to relax and enjoy the amenities offered at the hotel.  From start to finish, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed the tea experience - learning the process of tea-making from picking to processing to tasting.  We also enjoyed High Tea on the terrace one afternoon.  Everything was delicious and there was so much food provided, we didn't need much dinner that evening.  Our favorite experience was the dinner in the train car our first night.  We didn't know what to expect, but the experience was beyond anything we had imagined.  The food, once again, was delicious, and the uniqueness of the traveling train experience was a delight.  We would like to express our special thanks to Gowtham, Nobert, and Chef Shanmugavel for their attentive care in anticipating our needs throughout our stay and for making this stay a truly unique and memorable experience that our family will remember for years to come.",Family
Nuwara Eliya,Heritance Tea Factory,5,Stunning location - fascinating hotel,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel - a converted tea factory retaining much of the original industrial infrastructure, but redesigned to incorporate guest rooms, restaurant, bar, etc. The views were magnificent and the food was excellent. The only downside was the difficulty of getting there - our bus had to park about 4 kms away and shuttle buses picked us and our luggage up. But it was very smoothly organised and the steep and winding drive up was a bit of an adventure!
My only complaint was the firmness of the bed, my back and hips suffered a bit, but it was worth it for the experience.",Friends

The history alone with all the stories of the  factory to read  and machinery to see was very interesting. Room was to a good standard and had heaters etc and the views of the hills with tea plantations and the village near by was a treat to have from our bedroom. Their is a small tea factory tour to take and can pick some tea leaves like a real tea pickers.Food was very tasty and plentiful with a set  menu dinner though first 2 courses were from a buffet. Live music played at night and as we didn't leave till late morning the next day we had a chance to look at the beautiful garden .",Couples

We were in Ocean View Suite and the room is size of a 2 bedroom apartment with amazing views and swings. The best thing to remember is how friendly and supportive the staff is. Starting from the reception, room service, pool, restaurant and even the staff who are not customer facing are so friendly.  Out of all Kanishka in Bojunhala restaurant is the BEST. I need to mention him as he was very kind, supportive and friendly. Keep up the good work and smile always. And to mention the food is very tasty. They had a wide variety of food selection with many action stations. Chef Ladies in the hoppers station are very friendly.

We requested them to Atleast give us usage at adult pool , that also they said no, they tell use the baby pool for famiily , which was only 2.5 feet depth. We even requested room upgrade for which they told me it will take 2 more hours to ready those rooms. Which 5 star property does this. I have been to Mariott Welagama and Taj Bentota both were amazing but this Shangrila Hambantota is worthless in customer experience. 
2. Food I suggest only book if u are NON VEGETARIAN EATER. The. Buffet have very limited choise for vegetarian and Indian vegetarian there were only 3 items on menu. . 75% items are non vegetarian . Trust me guys Indian vegetarian will die with hunger here , Jain people please avoid this place the whole area smells of meat and fish products. No proper exhaust. Vegetarian specially jain this hotel is strict no no . The chef was pre informed about our dietary requirement . But we got 1 extra paneer vegetable for all that effort. The chef did favour on us by making that also. We requested to Atleast give one vegetarian pizza because we had no option on buffet to eat, but they said the pizza is not on buffet and chargeable. What type of hospitality is this . The manager should understand that they already have limited option and not able to eat and inspite of supporting they asked for money. Disgusting hospitality and the manger is worthless being a five star. . 
3. Morning breakfast had 3 veg items . Only inspire of head chef knowing there are vegetarian guest also after all discussion following dinner in the night. , still they could not bake us 1 or 2 eggless pastries. After some talk chef managed to do a favour again by bringing some from kitchen. These guys provide but first they spoil the mood by saying not there and than do us favour by providing little . They make channa masala and when u asked what to eat with , they told me with thick dosa. Is he really a chef or what . Who eats channa masala with dosa . They could have baked some puris with channa masala . Senseless and weird. Just hiding their inability to cater properly. 
4. No proper tagging of allergies on food items . Things that contain eggs are just named and no sign of any allergiens in food being a 5 star is shocking . Did they hire head chef someone from 3 star hotel . Some items have eggs and it’s mentioned other have eggs and still not mentioned . Is it some sort of joke. 
5. WiFi sucks . Rooms air conditioning sucks . Property is under lots of maintenance . 
6. Duty managers are sleeping and unresponsive. They keep u wait for 15- 20 min to meet with them. Like they have paid us money to come here and attend them. 
INSHORT ITS A PARADISE FOR NON VEGETARIAN EATERS. Vegetarian should refrain from booking. You pay so much in name if 5 star property and they have such low standard for customer satisfaction 

Shangrila Team please mention on website that u can’t provide and cater to vegetarian. Buffet should have Atleast 50% veg on menu. Including pastries also. Go green and start serving vegan and vegetarian. Just saving papers and washing powders won’t make u green.",Family

Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,4,Great resort to laze around,"Spent a couple of nights here as part of a tour group,  lazing around in resorts is not really our thing but it was a bit isolated and we had, had a busy few days before so got into the resort mode (including sunburn) lazed around the pool reading.

Complex is pretty impressive with several good eating and drinking options, though for Sri Lanka a little on the expensive side but guess what you get in a ""luxury"" resort.

Service generally good though one day at 4:45pm room still not made up so chased that up as we wanted new towels.

If you want a good resort on the beach to laze around for a day or two this is a good option if you are in the region.",Couples

Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,5,Heartfelt Thanks for an Exceptional Stay at Shangri‑La Hambantota,"Shangri‑La Golf Hotel Resort & Spa Hambantota Team,

I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding experience my family and I enjoyed during our recent stay at your resort. From the moment we arrived, the warm welcome and genuine care shown by your front office team set the tone for a truly memorable holiday.

Throughout our stay, every member of your staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. The F&B team at your restaurant delighted us each day with an impressive variety of delicious dishes—every meal was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. We especially enjoyed the local specialties, and appreciated how attentive the servers were in recommending new items and accommodating our requests.

Our room was immaculately maintained, with all facilities in perfect working order. The housekeeping staff paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring our space was always pristine and inviting. Equally noteworthy was the spotless condition of the entire resort: the sparkling pool areas, lush gardens, and common areas all reflected your commitment to cleanliness and excellence.

We would also like to extend our gratitude to the management team for regularly checking in on us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Your proactive approach and genuine interest in our comfort did not go unnoticed and made us feel truly valued as guests.

Thank you once again for crafting such a wonderful experience. We look forward to returning to Shangri‑La Hambantota and will gladly recommend your resort to friends and family.",Family

Hambantota,Shangri-La Hambantota,5,A Experience to remember at Shangrila Hambanthota,"Really warm experience my wife and I had in the near past. Such degree of comfort, freedom and hospitality I have only felt at my home. Every aspect of your needs in terms of relaxing is looked in to. If you’re a family with kids or adults who wish to travel alone or a couple who what’s to relax. This is the place to be.
The staff are always with a smile and eager to help out. All waiting staff at the buffet Bojunhala are such a welcoming lot. Working so hard like busy bees to attend to every need of its guests. You see how tired they are but never forget to smile and offer a helping hand should you need it. Out of all the lovely waiting staff, KANISHKA is the one to lookout for. He stands out above the rest with his friendly nature and going an extra mile to satisfy his customers. 
A little tip for whoever reading this. If you want to relax and enjoy peace and a real holiday I suggest you come here during the off season.",Family

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Relaxing and beautiful people.,"We have had two wonderful weeks here at this resort. Today is our last day, so I thought I would write a review. From when we arrived to the whole time here, it's been amazing. The staff go above and beyond for you. The housekeeping team is excellent, making you feel very at home. Our room was spotlessly clean every day. The gardens are perfectly done and kept to a high standard. The pools are clean, and at this time, it's very quiet, so no rushing for a sunbed in the morning. The buffet gives a wide choice of food, and we love the themed nights. For myself, the Asian let itself down. It was cold food, and the food was not restocked or freshly cooked. We did go the 8.30 sitting, and it just felt they hadn't recovered from the previous sitting, which was a shame. But overall, this hotel is perfect and would highly recommend it. Also, I would recommend going around to see the island and experience the Sri Lankan culture.",Couples

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,10/10,"’m currently staying at the Riu in Sri Lanka, and the service has been nothing short of exceptional. I’d like to especially highlight the incredible hospitality of three individuals who have truly made this holiday unforgettable.

Harsha, the sous chef, has been a standout from day one. Every day, he’s taken the time to walk me through the local ingredients and flavours, sharing his deep knowledge and passion for Sri Lankan cuisine. When traditional Sri Lankan curries haven’t been on the buffet, he’s gone out of his way to prepare something special just for me—each dish full of bold, authentic flavours that you simply can’t find outside of Sri Lanka. His food has been a genuine highlight of the trip, and I only wish he’d open his own Sri Lankan restaurant in London—I’d be first in line. Harsha’s talent, warmth, and dedication to his craft have made my dining experience here unforgettable.

Marshall has been a fantastic host at every mealtime, always welcoming us with a smile and taking a genuine interest in our family. He’s also been kind enough to educate me on cricket and the IPL—so much so that I’ll be following the Mumbai Indians from now on!

Malinda, the head waiter, has been the epitome of professionalism—always attentive, friendly, and consistently delivering a high standard of service.

Alongside the brilliant kids’ club team, these three individuals have helped make this a holiday we’ll cherish for years to come.

The pool is beautiful and not crowded although the weather was hot. Buffet meals with Sri Lankan dishes on one side and western dishes on the other. Very tasty curries. We had a boat trip on the Madu River to see 64 small islands, including cinnamon island where we learned more about the growing and harvesting of cinnamon. The highlight of this trip was sailing through the mangrove caves. I just repeat that in Sri Lanka they definitely train their hotel staff well, all very friendly and efficient.
Don't forget to visit Galle, standing in one spot we could see a Hindu temple, Muslim temple, English Christian church and a Dutch Reformed church without moving.",Family

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Rain or Shine - Riu Delivers,"We visited Hotel Riu Ahungalla in May 2025 with two small kids, fully aware of the south-west monsoon season. We decided to take a chance, hoping for nice, less UV intensive weather and low-touristic moment of the year. We specifically choose this hotel because we are loyal fans of the Riu brand. From the moment we arrived, it exceeded our expectations. Despite the season, the weather was wonderful. Occasional rain showers, and cloudy skies were actually a very welcome refreshment. The service was impeccable. Every staff member was professional, warm and genuinely friendly. We felt really taken care of. The hotel itself is stunning and caters beautifully to both: families and adults only. There is one big common pool, one sporty pool, one adults only and one, slammer for kids only. The food was delicious, especially the Asian  cuisine. Each dish was full of flavour. Cleanliness was another strong point, bot in the common areas and in the rooms. The spa was also easily accessible, with plenty of staff available - no need to wait long for the treatments. Right outside the hotel, there was a convenient Tuk-Tuk / taxi stand, making it easy and affordable to travel to nearby attractions and shopping. The hotel has two shops, one more affordable with all kinds of souvenirs and clothes. 
Whether you are travelling alone, with the kids or adults only mode - the hotel will offer a variety of solutions to spend your time.
We are already thinking about coming back! It is a perfect destination for a two weeks holidays, and we wholeheartedly recommend.",Family
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Relaxing stay with impressive service,"I recently stayed at Riu Sri Lanka with my family (9 nights stay) and had an absolutely wonderful experience. The hotel was really nice, the food was delicious, and the staff were incredibly polite – just as I had read in all the reviews prior to my trip. I have to agree, it was all true!

I particularly want to praise the room service. The room was always clean and tidy, and the daily towel art was fantastic! Each day, after breakfast, we were greeted by different towel creatures like crocodile, penguin or a rhino! These amazing creations added a special touch to my stay. It was the room boy Supun, under the supervision of Kaushal, who could create all these - I am adding some pics below. Amazing, right?

Another person who made our stay memorable is Githmi. Githmi is the girl who greeted us at the door to the restaurant before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She always had a pleasant smile on her face, was very nice, and very polite. Githmi's warm welcome made us enjoy the delicious food even more!

Thank you, Riu Sri Lanka, for making our visit memorable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a delightful and unique experience.",Family
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,5,Fabulous stay at Riu Sri Lanka,"Just stayed 11 nights in a superior sea view room , 
Hotel was super quiet as it's low season, which suited us great , plenty of sunbeds to choose from, and on a couple of days had the whole pool to ourselves.
It does get a lot busier at the weekend with the locals visiting 

As lots of people have already said the sea is rough especially this time of the year , with red flags all the time so if your looking for sea swimming maybe this isn't the place for you at this time of the year. 

Weather was super hot around 30 degrees each day but expect some rain and storms and it to be overcast most days as it is the start of monsoon season 
We experienced the best storm I have ever seen, 

The hotel and grounds are kept immaculate  ,with plentiful wildlife 
We saw large snails ,chipmunks, lizards and even monkeys in the trees at the front of the hotel 
the staff from the Front desk to the housekerping team were some of the friendliest people I have even met in all my years of travelling, nothing was too much trouble. 

The superior sea room i would say has the best views as you can see the entire grounds as well as the front row sea view 

If you are looking for evening shows, we never saw one as a couple of times we went to the show area for 9pm , there was only a few people, so I think the shows got cancelled 
They did have singers in the lobby area 

Food is very tasty. However, buffet does do the same sort of food each night 

The only negative I will add coming at this time of year and im unsure if this is just a seasonal or year round thing is the al carte  restaurants,  2 are only open 1 time per week and the steak resturant open twice , and although they advertise beef tenderloin steak they only had beef strip steak 

Very limited choice on cocktails and if you are used to staying in other rius in the carribbean as we are they don't seem to offer any of the creamy style cocktails or branded alcohol,  wasn't to much of a problem just had to stick with wine 

The tuk tuk drivers on the front of the hotel  are ok just negotiate a price when telling them where you want to go, 

If you prefer to eat outside of the hotel get a tuk tuk to aluthgama to the pier 88 resturant you won't be disappointed,  just be careful if the tuk tuk driver waits, he may want to join you at your table as this happened to us  twice,  just politely say would you mind leaving 
And they will sit outside 

Also the tuk tuk drivers on the beach might take you to places you have not asked to go like a temple or turtle sanctuary / jewellers  seems they must get some sort of back hand for taking people to spend there money we asked to be taken to 1 place which should have taken half hour and didn't get to our actual destination for 2 hours with all the unscheduled pitstops . 

I would definitely return to this hotel",Couples
Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,1,A BIG NO NO FOR INDIAN VEGETARIAN AND JAIN AND GUJARATHI COMUNITIES. YOU WILL STAY HUNGRY DURING THE STAY. SAD ROOMS,"THE PROPERTY IS OLD AND NOT SO GOOD. 
INDIAN VEGETARIAN MEALS ARE MISSING . In breakfast we had only 1 option of dosa. All the pastries had eggs and when we inquired and spoke to chef he simply said yes it’s that all. No extra effort to accomodate out meal requirement . 
Chose these properties . 
Request all Indian and vegetarian guest please don’t take this hotel . You will die of hunger. We had only one option of brown bread and dosa in whole buffet to eat . Eggs in everything . They don’t know to bake without eggs.  Mariott and taj are much better in providing meals .

The hotel was great, we were lucky to enjoy celebration of the New Year with local games food and drinks. 
Pillow fight was a lot of fun. 
 I only wish the beach was cleaner. 
There are a lot of plastic on the beach, but anyways the waves are very strong tho swim so you will need to find another beach if you want to swim in the ocean. 
This place has the best sunsets…",Friends
Negombo,Sentido Heritance Negombo,4,A nice place to stay,"We have travelled around Sri Lanka and stayed at 4 different 5* hotels. While it has been a pleasant experience, this hotel is more commercialised compared to the others we stayed in. The room was very clean with stunning sea views, but sadly lacking in a hairdryer that we had to ask for and wait 15 minutes while it was delivered. The pool area is good and the swim up bar is a very nice touch. The buffet at breakfast and dinner has a fantastic choice, but sadly the hot dishes were not very hot and a bit of a disappointment. Compared to our other hotels the service in the restaurant was average at best. When checking out 2 of the lads at the desk asked for a mention in our review. Sorry but from my point of view, all you really did was take my money for drinks and a meal and I didn’t receive any service from you. Would I praise every checkout assistant whenever I went shopping at the supermarket, I think not.",Couples

Negombo,Sentido Heritance Negombo,4,Fine hotel relatively near airport to start tour of Sri Lanka. Garden/Pool area excellent,"We stayed here for the first night of our tour of Sri Lanka, it is not too far from the airport.  Rooms did indeed have an excellent sea view , so for once that promise did live up to the hype.  Rooms are good, if a little shabbily finished around the edges in bathroom/shower.   Air con works well, good shower. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (we did arrive early), but they had changing rooms to allow us to sit by pool, we spent most of the day in the garden / pool area for the afternoon, very pleasant. Pool has a small swim-up bar. Towels provided.  It didn’t bother us but there were a lot of crows round, I guess if you were there for a few days their call may get on your nerves after a while. Went for a walk on the beach. Great beach, but beach is pretty littered which is a shame. We asked for a-la-carte for dinner, but somehow in communication issues they ended up giving us the buffet which I guess they push as its easier for them. So if you don’t want the buffet, make sure you are understood.  It was pretty good but was a lot of food! Wine is expensive. Staff need to sell amenities a bit more, I didn’t know there was a gym (no-one mentioned it) until we left and we only found the roof-top bar by mistake!   But all in all, a perfect stop for one night at start of tour.",Couples

The pool was clean and the perfect temperature. Highly recommend this hotel. I got a foot massage in the spa which was very relaxing. There is lots of options for the food and it is to a very high standard. We visited Minneriya national park and Sigiriya rock while staying here.

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"A lush, tranquil, stay","We absolutely loved our stay at Jetwing Lake. The hotel offered a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of nearby tourist attractions, it provided us with a peaceful, calm environment to unwind and recharge.
Our room was huge, featuring a large balcony where we could sit and enjoy the stunning views of the lake. The bathroom was equally impressive, offering plenty of space and modern amenities to make our stay even more comfortable. Waking up to the serene sight of the lake every morning was a true highlight of our stay.
The dining experience was great(we opted for half board). The breakfast spread was varied, fresh, and satisfying, with options that catered to all tastes. The evening dining was equally impressive, offering delicious meals with high-quality ingredients.
The staff at Jetwing Lake were a standout. They were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with any request.",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"Where style, comfort and quality collide","Stayed here for 3 nights as part of our Sri Lanka tour.  The hotel is a lovely oasis just outside of Dambulla.  We had a ground floor room with access to the pool which suited us perfectly.  The room itself was large with a huge bathroom containing both a bath and a walk in shower.  Bed & pillows were both really comfortable.

We were out each morning but returned in the afternoon and made use of the sunbeds and pool which were always quiet (no blaring music & no fight for a bed!) & had beautiful views of the lake. 

Breakfast is buffet style with lots of choice & well prepared.  We stayed on a B&B basis but ate in the buffet restaurant each evening as the choice & quality was so good.  I don't think there was anywhere within walking distance that would have been an option.

The gym is small but well equipped.  

All of the staff were friendly and attentive.  We noted that this hotel has a few trainee managers that seemed to go the extra mile to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay, in particular was Ishodha (not sure about the spelling!) who was especially attentive.  Good luck to him, he has the makings of a fine hotel manager!

We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish, quality stay in this part of Sri Lanka.",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,A great base for visiting a variety of tourist attractions,"This is a modern, stylish hotel where you will be well looked after.
It is a beautiful location on a lake and with a mountain in the distance.
Lovely large rooms with a balcony overlooking the pool, lake and mountain.
The buffet dining facilities offer a wide range of food to suit all tastes.
Despite its size our stay here was very quiet, perhaps because the large groups on coach tours are out on excursions during the day. 
Well located for visiting the Cultural Triangle, Sigiriya Rock and one of the National Parks for an elephant safari.",Couples

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"Fantastic, immersed in nature, wonderful team. Our stay was too short!","This is an amazing, near new hotel in a beautiful location. Modernist style, beautifully appointed room & grounds. The staff are genuinely helpful & friendly. 

The buffet & room service are great.

We were lucky to get a top floor room in the building not overlooking the pool, in the wing looking to the lake & trees, so were entertained by the monkeys visiting our balcony, along with the squirrels & birds. We could easily see birds including fish eagles & kites. Most of the monkeys run away except a couple of them, so don’t leave food or clothes on the balcony… we were amused that a male knew where to look for food through the window.

There are birdwatching & other tours which we didn’t have time for but wish we had done.

The pool is 70 metres long, & warm, with a bar near it. The gym is very good. 

A ride to Dambulla town is about 15 minutes.

If I had to comment on a negative… the light switches are in very strange places!

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,A room with a view,"As part of our tour of sri-lanka, we stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel room was lovely overlooking the lake in the garden block. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with a great shower and bath with a view. It was lovely sitting out early evening watching the monkeys playing in the trees,listening to the peacocks and many different birds. I could have stayed there forever with the view. 
The buffet restaurant had lots of choice for both breakfast and evening meal. Lovely to sit outside for both and listen to the wildlife. Loved the different closed areas for starters and dessert which prevents birds flying in to steal the food.
We found the hotel to be both clean and comfortable and staff welcoming and pleasant. 
I would definitely recommend and sadly not enough time to spend enjoying the facilities due to a tight schedule of our tour however we did make use of the wonderful swimming pool which had a lovely view of the grounds.
Unsure if there is any entertainment in the evening as we were shattered and retired early to get ready for another adventure the following day.

Appallingly unprofessional Head Office Customer Care","The Cinnamon Grand is a wonderful hotel with stunning architecture. It has very comfortable, large open rooms. The staff are one of its greatest features. Whilst I was there all of the staff were most friendly and went out of their way to be helpful after the first day I was greeted by name by staff who came to me to ask if all was well and could they assist. Morning breakfasts were a joy as the staff remembered my preferences . Samantha and Dumith are only two of the names of the wonderful staff who made my stay so perfect.
The restaurants are all excellent, in particular my favourite was Lagoon with its stunning display seafood, all of which could be cooked in multiple ways. 

I had a problem changing the details of my booking. I was booked via keytravel for 4 nights but wanted to break this into 3 + 1 with a night away in the middle to visit Kandy. You would think this would be a simple change. Keytravel were useless and couldn't do it. Cinnamon Head Office stonewalled it with stupid comments about their policy for third-party bookings. As a head office, they were totally customer-unfriendly and stupidly tied to a nonsensical policy. As a senior academic in hospitality and tourism for 41 years I have never come across such stupidity. They would fail any of my classes on customer care.
I was appalled at the lack of customer orientation and care by Keytravel and Cinnamon Head Office.
 It was only when I contacted the hotel sales department directly that Shaun Windsor very professionally took ownership and instantly resolved the nonsensical problem. 
I should not have needed to jump through hoops for such a simple request; keytravel and Cinnamon Head Office should hang their heads in shame.",Business

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,4,Hotel Sri Lanka… Honest Review,"The hotel was excellent and food varied. We never had any issues with the food, plentiful and varied. 

The team really made this holiday, Gehan from the animation team was the best and had the best interaction with all the guests.

We had 14 full days here (still here now) and every day was just perfect. No problems whatsoever from the most amazing team who work SO hard. 

Room (3030) excellent, the views over the beach and sea made morning and sunsets even better… ask for this room when staying here.

Team- THE BEST! We have stayed in plenty of Riu Places but this is the best service and standards we have ever had. 

Drinks- Definitely room for improvement but Lion Beer was fresh and good quality. Wine different in every restaurant but good quality. 

Only downside to the whole holiday was the hotel are trialing the locals to attend over the weekend in the low season which is an amazing idea and well deserved but they are so rude towards the team and guests. We were pushed out of the way at food, eating with their heads from the buffet, the wife gestured too and a fight at reception. The team couldn’t do enough to rectify the situations but it’s one to be aware of over the weekends at this hotel.

We did (are) having the best time and would recommend to anyone despite the few minor issues.",Couples

Ahungalla,Hotel Riu Sri Lanka,2,Sri Lanka,"-Only one plug socket by the bed very strange…

- show drain festers a foul smell

- Food is choice poor and served lukewarm. Would fail any food inspection. Left me with an upset stomach for most of my stay, and my journey home extremely was uncomfortable due to this. 

- Staff are very attentive 

- Management do not trust workers heard from the manger and reps within the hotel to make sure smart devices and valuables are locked away.

- The cleaning head also asks for reviews on how the cleaning staff did daily. Cleaning is done a strange hours, and the constant check ups became annoying.
 
- putting your belongings through airport type security screenings on arrival and every time you re enter the hotel- if you plan on doing excursions please be aware of that. 

- difficult to regulate the temperature in the room.

- Room was not ready on arrival after travelling for over 28 hours being made to wait another 3 hours to gain access into the room 

- Late noise disturbances late into the evening 

- temperature of water in shower changes rapidly and i got scolded by the temperature of the water 

- Hotel entertainment is poor, the have the same acts rotating so if you’re spending more than week here you will pretty familiar with the schedule. Some performances go on late into the evening",Family

We had our dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We are vegetarian so were not sure if we would enjoy the buffet dinner.

Chef Balbeer, made us feel at home, clearly explaining all the different vegetarian dishes. Once he realised, we don't eat eggs, he said no worries and prepared rotis which we thoroughly enjoyed along with very tasty curries. Chef Balbeer went out of his way to prepare perfect potato bhajias, which my wife and I enjoyed.

The whole of the restaurant team provided service with a smile and would like to mention Ganesh for his exemplary service.

Nuwara Eliya,Heritance Tea Factory,3,Nice - But Can Be So Much Better,"Way off the beaten tack this hotel is quite secluded and can be a great place away from the rat race. Is it worth the money they charge?

The answer is a definite no!! It should be half the going rate as it is quite tired, service is okay with a downside if everyone looking for a tip.

Food is rather average so lower your expectation. With only 50 rooms they cannot put on a big spread so menu is a little limiting.

Added activities such as tea leaf picking and the factory tour or the tea processing is a nice touch. You blink then it’s over!! Now what do you do??

Sadly that’s it . The hotel is tired . The rooms  are dated . Nothing looks like it has been refreshed since the hotel opened . With the most outstanding setting there are no deckchairs . Anything soft to sit on would have been appreciated.

We couldn’t find an iron in the room, which we believe we had during our last stay. We’re not sure if there have been any changes, but adding this would be a nice touch. We also tried to order some cocktails from the pool bar, only to find that they weren't being served during the dates we stayed. However, this didn't take away from the overall experience.

We were greeted with a lovely gesture, and it was clear that a lot of effort had gone into making us feel welcome.

The rooms were very comfortable and had all the facilities we needed. Although the beach was a bit rough, we still enjoyed it. The pool was very relaxing and had ample space to swim around and chill.

Thisari was our host, and she was extremely helpful and clear with all her instructions. She was always reachable and assisted us in booking the nature walk and the canoe ride—which, to be honest, we might have skipped if she hadn’t convinced us. And what a great decision that turned out to be!

Suresh at the restaurant was also very helpful, friendly, and witty. He made sure we were having a good time and regularly checked if we needed anything. He even took our photos without any hesitation, which we really appreciated.

The nature walk was a lovely experience. Even though we are locals, it’s definitely a must-do—it gives you a fresh perspective on the surroundings and is also very informative. Konara, our guide, was punctual, friendly, and clearly passionate about what he does. Although he knew we were locals, he still made the walk engaging and interesting.

Overall, I would give a 10 out of 10 for the location, the people, the service, and the memories.",Couples
Tangalle,Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort,5,A Perfect Paradise to End Our Sri Lankan Journey!,"This place felt like a little piece of heaven in Sri Lanka, truly the perfect way to end our hectic journey after a week of exploring the island. 

We stayed at six hotels over nine days in Sri Lanka and experienced the warm hospitality the country is known for, but the staff at Anantara were exceptionally generous with their time—and their sincerity felt truly genuine. 

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm ceremonial welcome. The check-in process and tour of the grounds were handled with elegance, and our room was clean with a lovely view. 

A special shoutout to Ms. Thisari, who made our stay truly memorable. She was not only helpful but also thoughtful with every arrangement, going the extra mile to ensure we were comfortable throughout.

Suresh, one of the staff at Journey Restaurant, was also a delight. He greeted us with the biggest smile each morning at breakfast and was always attentive to our needs. During one of our dinners, another member of the waitstaff (I’m so sorry I didn’t catch your name!) noticed my husband sneezing and offered to brew us a pot of black tea with ginger and honey. The tea was delicious, but what touched us most was the attentiveness and sincerity behind the gesture.

One afternoon, while enjoying in-room dining in our garden, a beautiful peacock came and stayed with us until we finished our meal. It was one of the most magical moments of our trip.

Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle exceeded all our expectations and gave us the perfect ending to our Sri Lankan adventure. Highly recommended!

Negombo,Sentido Heritance Negombo,1,A big disappointment!,"This was our second visit to Sri Lanka on a family holiday. After visiting the south west and south of the island, this time we decided to have a bit of convenience of the airport-proximity and stayed at Heritance Negombo for six nights in four rooms for the group. 

The hotel is perfectly located at the Negombo beach with nice surroundings and easy beach access. The lawns are very well kept. All rooms are sea facing and spacious enough. 

That’s where I run out of the positives for this place unfortunately. Comparatively, this was our worst Sri Lankan hospitality experience. Kindly let me begin:
- despite booking months in advance with requests to allocate rooms together (as travelling with 80+ old parents), albeit in the same wing, we were given rooms apart. The duty manager gave us sloppy excuses when challenged. The other request regarding birthday of a group member was completely ignored.
- one room wasn’t ready at checkin despite we arriving at 5pm. The cleaning was down in a haste with room full of mosquitoes when handed over to us. 
- the restaurant was shambles to begin with. On day one, over dinner, we were completely ignored over the other Caucasian guests with order not arriving for well over an hour. While we thought that this was an exception, unfortunately the trend was to be seen everywhere. 
- Most guests use this as one or two night stay at the start or the end of their tour. Having booked it for a long stay, we were astonished to see that breakfast spread was exactly the same every day which was a haphazard array of assortments with poor quality. Offerings at other similarly priced hotels in SL is far superior. 
- The staff lacked attention to detail and hardly acted to customers’ requirements. On regular occasions, meal (or general) requests were lost, miscommunicated or mismanaged. It reflected lack of proper training even at supervisory level. 
- My parents were left locked out of their room at 11pm for more than 30minutes due to low battery reflecting poor housekeeping but it was not that what irked us but the behaviour of a staff member who questioned us if we were valid guests for the room despite three time card renewal by the reception. 
- The restaurant menu lacked variety especially if you have dietary restrictions. My parents who were vegetarians just had couple of items on the whole a-la-carte menu to order from (imagine this is Sri Lanka which has abundance of vegetables and fruits). Even the SriLankan menu was sparse. There were no coconuts (even at outdoor bar despite being on the menu) or bananas (at breakfast) to be found during our long stay with excuses galore (again don’t forget this is land of bananas and coconuts but this place either finds Sri Lankan authenticity too demeaning or a nuisance to be bothered with). The cafe and Italian across the road, which was part of the hotel, again had very limited menu which meant that they hardly had any punters despite being at prime location and wonderful setting. 

On the whole, it was an underwhelming experience to say the least. It seemed that the management is trying hard to cater to western clients forgetting the fact the clientele are there to have an essential Sri Lankan experience.  The food offering is poorly thought through. And it might sound controversial but perhaps, they don’t want coloured guests, so I would avoid this place if you are not white as the experience reminded us of a colonial mindset (I know I’m saying this in 2025 but that’s how we felt).",Family

Colombo,Cinnamon Red Colombo,1,Getting Worst,"I’m honestly furious with how badly this hotel has gone downhill. I used to rate it 5 stars. I used to recommend it to friends and family. But after this recent stay, I’ll never come back — and I hope management takes this seriously because things are falling apart fast.

To the management:
You desperately need to retrain your staff. Whatever standards you once had are clearly gone. Hospitality isn’t just about rooms — it’s about respect, service, and care. Right now, none of that exists here.

Let me break down the four situations that made my stay a complete nightmare:

1. Check-in was a disaster.
It was slow, disorganized, and beyond frustrating. I waited for ages while others cut the line with the staff just ignoring it. It set the tone for what turned out to be an awful stay.

2. Lied to about room availability.
I asked to extend my stay — they told me the hotel was full. Turns out, that was a lie. I checked online right there and booked a room from their own site. When I showed this, they gave me the runaround, wasting my time and acting like they were doing me a favor. Unbelievable.

3. Rude and unprofessional housekeeping.
When I requested cleaning the next morning, the cleaner showed up and started interrogating me about when I checked in and why the room needed cleaning again. Then he blamed the reception team like it was my fault. I’m here to rest, not get caught in your internal mess.

4. Food delivery drama.
I ordered food via Uber Eats, and the driver brought it to the entrance. I asked the staff to collect it from reception — totally normal, right? Nope. The outside crew refused to even let the driver park. One staff member, Manohara, insisted the driver just wait until I came downstairs. Even after I made it crystal clear to just take the delivery, the way they treated the driver — and me — was downright rude and dismissive.

I’m angry. I’m disappointed. I’m done with this place.
This hotel used to feel welcoming — now it just feels like a joke. If anyone in management actually cares, fix this. Fast.",Family

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,VERY SPECIAL HOTEL AND STAFF,"Fabulous hotel, stunning views, friendly staff, very comfortable bed, bath with a view, delicious food, large swimming pool, beautiful gardens. We had 4 wonderful nights staying here and everything was perfect. The buffet is superb and special thanks to Gimhani who always greeted us with a beautiful smile and to Manoj who was very attentive. The reception staff were so friendly and professional special mention to Madhushani and Lahiruka who always greeted us so warmly. All staff were incredibly kind and welcoming. Do hope one day to return as your hospitality exceeded our expectations ❤️",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"A beautiful location, a lovely hotel and brilliant housekeeping","We were here for 3 nights whilst exploring the Cultural Triangle. We were fortunate to have a room with a balcony overlooking the garden and the lake. It was a beautiful setting and we awoke each morning to the most amazing bird song.  Our room was spacious and comfortable. The reception staff were charming and made us feel welcome, the staff in the main restaurant were similarly friendly and very accommodating. We did try the Chinese restaurant on the top floor on one occasion but we were very disappointed in the food and although not busy the service was slow. The buffet breakfasts provided an amazing choice of fruit, cooked food, cold meats, cereals etc. Something for everyone’s taste. 

The hotel is very eco conscious with their own solar panels as well as a water purification plant. Plenty of fresh water was available in refillable bottles. 

But best of all were the housekeeping staff. They never seemed to stop work and yet were always cheerful and full of fun. On our last evening we returned to find an elephant made out of a towel on our bed along with flowers and ‘Goodbye’ written in grass stems. It made us smile - such a lovely touch.",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,Fantastic peaceful setting and excellent hotel,"This was our base for a few days whilst we went and explored the surrounding areas. 

Cannot fault the staff, the room (very spacious and modern) or the food (lots of salads and fruit unlike in other hotels that we have stayed at as part of our trip). 

I would highly recommend this. There are some other well known hotels and chains in Sri Lanka that have a lot to learn from this hotel.",Couples

Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,A modern hotel of quality,"A modern hotel with modern up to date facilities.
The hotel is set a little away from the main road and offers a peaceful retreat.  The staff are helpful and always have a smile on their face.  
Our room was luxurious with a great view of the lake, garden and pool.  Although we didn’t use the pool, it looked very inviting.
There are indoor and outdoor bars and a large open restaurant adjacent to and opening onto the garden.  There is an A La Carte or buffet option: both offering delicious food and a variety of options.
This is a hotel where large tour groups may use, but the space is plentiful.  We found this not to be off-putting.
Certainly a great hotel to use to explore Dambulla, Polanuruwa and Anuradhapura.",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,"Jetwing Lake hotel, Feb 2025","What a gem of a place. Super rooms, staff, meals, facilities. Just wow. We stayed 3 nights during our tour. Nothing bad can be said about this hotel. Bar and meal prices reasonable for this standard of accommodation. Didn't want to leave. Recommended",Couples
Dambulla,Jetwing Lake,5,A great start to the best holiday ever!,"After over a day travelling from the UK, Jetwing Lake was our first hotel stop for 2 nights and our first proper taste of Sri Lanka. On arrival we had the politest greeting with drinks & snacks, received a tour of the hotel and was shown to our room - a complimentary upgrade to the super deluxe.  When the young lady asked if it was ok to come into the room and then took her shoes off, we knew we were on holiday and we knew this hotel, and Sri Lanka in general, was going to be epic. 

After getting our head around the size of the room, the gorgeous view from our balcony over the pool & lake, the huge bathroom and the secret cupboard (I'll leave that as a surprise) we headed for a wander around the lake and to the bar for a celebratory drink where we were met with the same high level of service from the bar staff. One drink quickly turned into three or four.

Dinner time was fantastic and we dived into anything & everything Sri Lankan - all of it tasted so good.  We were half board for info and the food was buffet style for us. They lit fire torches outside adding to the atmosphere. Safe to say we slept well on night one ready for our first excursion of the holiday the next day.

Jetwing Lake is perfectly located for Sigiriya Rock which we went to the following morning. We then had a few hours relaxing by the amazing pool watching the birdlife, and then in the  afternoon we had our first safari close by at Minneriya National Park.

Our second evening and the following breakfast was just good as the first. During this breakfast we also ventured into the world of Egg Hoppers.  You have to try them!  The lady cooking the Egg Hoppers deserves a shout out for her friendliness, and cooking skills of course. 

The setting is beautiful and unlike anywhere we had stayed before and the level of cleaniness all around the hotel & gardens is definitely worth mentioning. Our room was spotlessly cleaned during our stay. Every member of staff we spoke to was polite & friendly & professional, from cleaners & gardeners to reception & restaurant staff. The sustainability & eco side of the hotel is also worth mentioning and it was nice to stay somewhere which has a real commitment to it.  Most of it you don't see but the little things, like water & bathroom condiments being refilled in glass bottles, I'm sure makes a noticeable difference.

From Jetwing Lake we went on to stay at Jewtwing St Andrews and Jetwing Yala later in the holiday and each of these hotels, although both different in style, was equally as good. I would highly recommend staying at any of these Jetwing hotels.",Couples
Colombo,Cinnamon Grand Colombo,4,To many people doing one job,"Lovely Hotel. Reception very efficient.  Found to many people doing one job.  The bell boy is perfectly capable of bringing the bags and answering questions.  Does not need two other people in suits coming as well and keep talking and explaining things as after a long flight you want to be left alone once your bags are brought up.  They keep talking till you give a tip to get them out of the room   to enable us to relax.  In the breakfast area again not only the waiter the floor Manager keeps bending your ear talking and not letting you get on with your breakfast.  I also found a lack of Sri Lankan Fruits and Juices. The bananas were kept so high in the buffet bar any person under 5 ft 5"" will need a step ladder to access.  Stayed later at the Mount Lavinia and they had a variety of SL fruits and juices. Varieties of Bananas changed everyday.",Couples

The delivery matched perfectly with what was advertised on the website and I was glad that all the guests agreed that both the main, and side dishes tasted exquisite. Considering the quality of the food, and the plethora of side dishes I believe it was well worth the price. Thanks for serving us an amazing lunch - I hope to order more in the future.",Friends

Galle,"Jetwing Lighthouse, A Luxury Reserve",3,"Beautiful Hotel, But Poor Communication and Disappointing Guest Experience","I stayed at Jetwing Lighthouse last year but decided to write this review now, as I believe it might help others who are considering booking this hotel. 

While the hotel itself is beautiful and the location is stunning, my overall experience was disappointing due to a lack of proper communication. One of the key things guests should be aware of is that buffet meals are only provided if there are more than 50 guests staying at the hotel. Otherwise, meals are served as a limited set menu — something I was only informed about after I checked in, despite booking my stay a month in advance. 

This isn't just about the buffet. It's about how the lack of transparency can affect the entire guest experience. When you're paying a premium price, there should be more consideration and flexibility around such matters. 

I’ve stayed in other hotels across Sri Lanka — even during the fuel crisis — and they still managed to provide buffets and excellent service, regardless of guest count. So it’s disappointing that a hotel of Jetwing’s reputation doesn’t communicate clearly or make such efforts. 

To be clear, I don’t blame the staff — they were friendly and did their best. But this is a management issue. Guests should be informed of important service limitations ahead of time so they can make informed decisions. 

Again, it’s not just about the buffet — it’s about how such things, when poorly handled, can negatively impact what could’ve been a memorable stay.",Family

The welcome with king coconut water was a refreshing touch after arrival. The rooms are spacious, well-furnished, and equipped with excellent amenities. Its commitment to sustainability is impressive—arguably one of the best I've seen.

I stayed in a sea view room, which was fantastic. It was just after the full moon—clouds moved across the sky, occasionally letting moonlight shine through. The atmosphere was serene, and I deeply enjoyed the solitude.

There are two swimming pools: one ideal for families, and another 25-meter lap pool that I especially appreciated—something I’ve rarely seen in hotels. Swimming there while listening to the crashing waves and watching them break into white foam was a unique experience.

The staff were warm and professional. Dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and very well arranged, offering a wide variety.

Overall, this was a memorable stay—one of the best in recent years. I definitely plan to return for a longer visit.",Solo

Galle,"Jetwing Lighthouse, A Luxury Reserve",5,"Jetwing Lighthouse – A Thoughtfully Curated, Unforgettable Stay for the Whole Family","Our family’s stay at Jetwing Lighthouse was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment we arrived, we were met with genuine warmth, attention to detail, and an atmosphere that perfectly blends luxury with the heart of Sri Lankan hospitality.

We were graciously welcomed by Umesha, whose kind and professional demeanor set the tone for the rest of our stay. She also hosted our afternoon tea, a serene experience overlooking the ocean with a lovely selection of teas, pastries, and savory treats. Her thoughtful care made the moment feel truly special.

Dining was consistently excellent across all three restaurants. Under the steady leadership of Awilse, every meal was served with precision, warmth, and attention to detail. The food was incredible—beautifully presented and rich in flavor.

Our children had an amazing time thanks to Imasha and Arushana, who organized creative activities like seashell jewelry making, stick figurines from coconut palm leaves, and a fun ice cream treat. They made our kids feel welcome, valued, and entertained throughout the stay.

The pool experience was another highlight, especially with Buddhika ensuring everything was clean, safe, and comfortable. The fact that the pool is filled with fresh, pure water from on-site wells was impressive—it made swimming feel even more refreshing. At the pool bar, Nimesh and Danidu stood out with their friendly and attentive service. Always serving with a smile, they made sure our family had everything we needed while relaxing poolside.

My wife also enjoyed a phenomenal spa treatment, which she described as peaceful and deeply rejuvenating.

Each night, we returned to a perfectly prepared room thanks to the daily turndown service—a small but impactful luxury that added to the overall comfort of our stay.

One of the standout experiences was the complimentary tuk tuk tour to Jetwing Kurulubedda, their sister property nestled in the jungle. The serene surroundings and breathtaking views of the six villas made for an unforgettable afternoon. We were served a unique and refreshing mangrove apple drink, crafted onsite and unlike anything we’ve tasted before.

Thanks to Imasha’s recommendation, we also enjoyed a guided tour of Galle Fort—organized entirely by the hotel. From the transport to the knowledgeable guide, it was the perfect way to experience the fort’s rich history without any hassle.

Adding a cultural touch to our stay was the traditional Kandyan dance performance hosted one evening at the hotel. It was a vibrant and captivating experience that brought Sri Lankan tradition to life right on the property.

One final note that truly impressed us was how well-maintained the resort is. We regularly observed quiet upkeep and repairs happening throughout the property—especially important for a beachfront hotel. It showed us how much care and pride the team takes in preserving the beauty and quality of Jetwing Lighthouse.

This resort is more than a destination—it’s a complete experience. Every team member, from the front desk to the bar staff, went out of their way to make our family feel at home. We left with full hearts, cherished memories, and an eagerness to return.

If you’re visiting Galle, do not miss the opportunity to stay at Jetwing Lighthouse. It is, without a doubt, a gem of Sri Lanka.",Family

Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,Beautiful Lagoon Views Amazing Spacious Room,"We stayed at this beautiful tropical paradise for 10 days, therefore, we got to know the history and the staff a bit to write an honest review.

Architecture:
Amaranthé Bay was built only 10 years ago, built for comfort with an American type of architectural design, similar to the Hilton or the Marriott.  Luxury and spacey, high tech but elegant.  Quality materials, the hard wood floor was a feature that I appreciated very much.  Sunlight fills the room all day long, the jacuzzi room could easily serve as a sauna.  The balcony with quality wooden chairs and table was comfortable to sit and watch the sunset plus the view of the lagoon and way over the yonder.  I loved the touch screen light control panel for all the lights throughout the 50m2 suite, the sitting room was spacious, the king size bed was comfortable, the big mirrors with surrounding led soft lights…big shower with rainforest shower head, good pressure and load of hot water.  
The towels are big and fluffy as they machined dry and not sundry, hence, it was a joy to dry myself with these towels.  I don’t mind sundry but machined dry feels like I’m at home in the states.  Amenities/toiletries were nice and handy, 2 one liter bottles of water daily more when we asked for more.  
Good housekeeping, a team of two male staff the whole time we were there.  They were very friendly, helpful and very polite.  
The ground was immaculately clean and well kept, ground keepers constantly on the move keeping the garden beautiful.  The pool guy was super friendly, helpful and thoughtful, no minute detail could escape his attention.  

Overall, the whole complex was very well designed and maintained, of course, it’s a tropical country with high humidity so there ought to be some damage to the paint but I noticed that they do their best with the up-keeping.  

Now the food was another matter entirely, there was absolutely no consistency.  One day it was fine from the buffet breakfast when there were more guests then the nest day same breakfast buffet but it was not well cooked or well prepared.   One time, the milk rice was cold and as hard as a rock.  Unbelievable!
The dishes weren’t authentic enough for us especially the level of spiciness, knowing that their dishes were prepared to serve guests that are not used to spicy dishes.  Hence, we made it clear to the kitchen staff that we wanted authentic spicy Sri Lankan dishes, it worked but as soon as there was a difference chef or not our usual server to take note then it all went back to square one again.  Well, needless to say, we were disappointed in the dishes they have in the menu.  Fixed menu when there weren’t enough guests, buffet when the hotel is busy.  

Though, we must give credit where credit is due, the management and the staff were very kind to accommodate our requests, they even took the dinner order ahead of time to make sure all was in order.  However, as soon as there was a change in staff or chef rotation, all the work went out the window.  There was a huge lack of communication, consistency and discipline.  
We enjoyed massively the accommodation but we were very disappointed in the dishes that they served.  We had high expectations before we arrived to Amaranthé Bay as we stayed at 4 Sri Lankan hotels before arriving to this lovely hotel and we had amazingly delicious and authentic cuisine until then.    We would return but will be eating elsewhere unless they made massive changes to their menu but will we risk it at the time of booking?",Couples
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,Excellent hotel and team,"The service was excellent, everyone very serviceful, very attentive, especially the manager, he always asked us if we needed anything and even played darts with my little sister when she didn’t have a partner, above and beyond friendliness. Rooms are very comfortable and very spacious beds, I recommend to go kayaking at sunset, gorgeous views",Family
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,Excellent Floridian Style Resort,"Ok what’s the score here ?
	1.	The rooms are magnificent and all the rubbish about them being  poorly maintained is in my experience completely baseless. We had two rooms , as we wanted to stay at a higher floor , and they moved us. Both rooms were excellently maintained. 
	2.	Each room was extremely large  50 m2 and as it was a suite had both a jacuzzi and a normal shower room. 
	3.	If you’ve ever been to say Florida it reminds me a lot of say a Ritz Carlton Resort there … very Floridian vibe 
	4.	We’ve stayed this trip in much smaller boutique hotels in Sri Lanka which I probably prefer but that’s purely a personal preference 
	5.	What about the food ? Well I wasn’t that impressed at first as we booked half board directly with the hotel and I felt that the food was a bit bland as it has to cater to a very diverse audience and to be be honest we like fairly authentic hot local food. The management and the catering staff couldn’t have done any more to try to accommodate this after we let them know.  So well done to them. But I have to be honest here the restaurant completely lacks consistency. This is a last minute addition to my review and it’s a very sad comment to make . From the very first time we went to the restaurant we said we didn’t like our food bland so if we are ordering something Sri Lankan we expect it be authentically spicy. We would say that and it wouldn’t happen after a few days they got this right decent rice and curry etc. but on our last night there we ordered dishes we’d had before …both completely bland right back to square one  . I even had exactly the same dish I’d had the night before. …we had to ask for chilly to be added to both our rapidly cooling dishes after we’d tried them and the manager said the staff didn’t know we liked the food spicy as they cook everything with no spice . This is unacceptable for someone who’d eaten there 10 nights in a row. Maybe I’m being unfair but the wait staff knew ..the chefs knew as my wife spoke to them but the every time the managers in the restaurant got involved it was wrong. For a while we had the same waiter he would ensure we got what we wanted but constantly changing who it was is almost bound to lead to the inconsistency we witnessed. This is undoubtedly the biggest issue with the hotel which prevents it being what it absolutely could be. There is  no way I would chose to my eat the evening meal in the restaurant while it continues to be like this …..sorry but that is how it is. 
	6.	One other more minor thing I didn’t like but this appears to fairly consistent in Sri Lanka is the prices being quoted then plus this tax and that tax and service etc. probably fine for Americans who are used to this but most of the audience here isn’t used to that. Just tell me how much it is please ? As it’s got service than do we not tip does all that go to the staff directly ? Anyway that’s a criticism more of Sri Lanka than of the hotel  

So in conclusion would we stay there again ? Definitely..I didn’t see anywhere in Trincomalee or surrounds that looked any better or even close. I would definitely eat dinner out not because the chefs cant cook or the waiting staff cant wait but because sad to say they can’t deliver anything like consistency. 

What about Trincomalee? It’s certainly far less developed that further south. There is plenty to do. Rather surprisingly we saw two large wild elephants crossing the road just a couple of kms from the hotel when we went off to see the wild crocodiles in a lake 

I found I got much more smiles from people outside of the hotel  with the odd word or phrase in Tamil particularly the fishermen on the beach 

So back to the hotel. Staff try extremely hard to accommodate requests and were without exception extremely nice. Good examples of this include the guy at the pool who could not of worked harder running around getting towels,  cleaning the pool , keeping his eye on junior swimmers. The people who cleaned the rooms who worked extremely hard to keep the place immaculate, the gardeners who made the place so beautiful, the guy delivering the delivering the  bag who carried monster weight bags up flights of stairs. All these the small cogs in the wheel did their jobs with grace and smiles 

We stayed for 10 days so I think we got a good idea of how this place works. We also spoke to a Swiss guy and he had stayed there a month or so. No one would stay there that long at for Sri Lanka a relatively expensive place if it didn’t have high standards 

One final suggestion maybe it would be even better if it was adults only place ? Kids and a breakfast buffet is a recipe for sticky fingered disaster.",Friends

Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,Peaceful Luxury at Its Best!,"We stayed at Amaranthé Bay Resort & Spa last week, and the entire experience was nothing short of peaceful, luxurious, and truly memorable. We booked the Junior Suite Room, and it exceeded our expectations — everything was spotlessly clean, incredibly comfortable, and well-equipped. The in-room Jacuzzi added a perfect touch of relaxation and created some truly unforgettable moments.

The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay, always making sure we were comfortable. The food was good, and we enjoyed everything we tried.

The resort’s location is stunning, surrounded by nature and calm waters. One of the highlights of our stay was the canoe ride — such a serene and beautiful experience that I’ll always remember.

From start to finish, everything about the stay felt well thought out and pleasant. I would definitely recommend Amaranthé Bay to anyone looking for a relaxing and luxurious getaway. Would love to return again!",Friends
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,"Fantastic experience at Amaranthé Bay Resort in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka","We were a family of 5 and stayed for one day but it was a fantastic experience:

1. The staff were amazing, always cheerful, kind and helpful, especially at the hotel's reception - Mayuran and Wirwin (apologies if I got the spelling wrong).
2. The rooms were spacious and amenities like the swimming pool and jacuzzi were great.
3. Overall, the food was excellent, and we had a very memorable 4-course dinner.
4. Many thanks to their partner Lawrence for giving us access to a pristine and beautiful sandy beach near the Silver Beach Hotel. One of the best I had ever seen.
5. We went whale and dolphin watching with their partner boat operator, and had a fabulous time. Highly recommend licensed boat pilot Vijay who showed calm and experience, and brought us to the precise locations where the whales and dolphins could be found. This trip is only available in the morning from 6 am to 8.30 am.

We hope to be back for a longer stay the next time. Highly recommend Amaranthé Bay Resort to anyone planning a visit to Trincomalee.",Family
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,1,Setting the Record Straight: Misleading Response from Hotel Management on M Wagner and P Roberts reviews,"There are several serious inaccuracies and omissions in the hotel’s response that need to be addressed.
	1.	We did not “change our minds.” We raised concerns before arrival.
We contacted Booking.com before arriving to request a cancellation waiver due to concerning recent reviews on Google. These were not isolated incidents, and many described exactly what we later saw ourselves: a worn-down, poorly maintained hotel far from what the photos suggest. Several of those reviews have since been reported and removed, just like the hotel tried to do with ours. This pattern of review suppression speaks volumes.
	2.	We were asked to lie in writing.
After we arrived, saw the condition of the hotel, and decided to leave, we were asked by hotel management to submit a written statement claiming we had changed our travel plans in order to be considered for a refund. That was completely untrue. We did not change our plans — we stayed in Trincomalee as planned and booked a new hotel 10 minutes before checking in, as shown clearly in our Booking.com account history. We have a recorded phone call in which this demand is made, and we have submitted this recording, along with all written correspondence, to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
	3.	The core issue is value and misrepresentation.
This property is priced like a luxury resort but does not meet that standard! The photos online are outdated and misleading. In reality, the hotel is old, visibly run-down, and poorly maintained. After traveling across Sri Lanka and staying in several more affordable places, it was shocking to find this was the most expensive and least impressive of all.
	4.	We have documented everything.
Every part of our experience — the false refund condition, the misleading photos, and the lack of cooperation — is backed by evidence: recordings, whatsapp communication, booking timestamps, and photographs. We have formally reported the hotel and submitted all materials to Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Let this also be a warning to not book with Booking.com (check their google rating reviews) since Booking.com has said they cannot assist! 

We stand fully by our review. It reflects a documented experience — not opinion, and certainly not defamation.

Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,1,Luxury in Name Only — Misleading and Mismanaged,"Booked this hotel for a much-anticipated, high-end finish to our Sri Lanka trip. What we got was anything but. The property is dated, badly maintained, and extremely overpriced. After staying at several budget-friendly places around the country, we were shocked to find those were in better condition than this supposed five-star resort.

Upon arrival, we attempted to cancel and request a refund after seeing the state of the property — a request the hotel flatly rejected. Instead, we were met with condescending and unhelpful responses. One manager even insinuated a refund would be possible if we submitted a written statement claiming a change of travel plans, which was absolutely not the case. This felt like an attempt to rewrite the facts to suit their policies.

We have only left one public review (on Google) to date, yet the hotel accused us of damaging their reputation and suggested we remove it — making this entire ordeal feel more like a PR battle than any genuine customer service.

For those considering this hotel based on star rating or images — please read recent reviews and look closely at the photos. We do not recommend this property and are still in the process of resolving this through Booking.com’s head office.",Family
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,5,Exceptional service,"Sri Lankan hospitality at its best! From the security guard, to the staff manning the pool, housekeeping and front desk, everyone was super pleasant and helpful! The junior suite with the jacuzzi and balcony is worth the upgrade. Loved the breakfast spread too!",Couples
Trincomalee,Amaranthe Bay Resort,1,⭐ 0-Star: Severely Misrepresented and Managed with Arrogance,"We booked this hotel expecting a luxury experience to end our Sri Lanka trip. What we found on arrival was shocking: a severely outdated, run-down property that bore no resemblance to the photos or description. It was a massive letdown — especially given the price. Hostels and backpacker lodges in the area were in better shape and cost a fraction of the rate.

Before arrival, we became concerned after locals and recent online reviews raised red flags. On arrival, our concerns were confirmed — and we immediately expressed that we weren’t comfortable staying. Management’s response was dismissive, at times aggressive, and entirely unprofessional. Instead of addressing the issues, they insisted on keeping the full payment under the pretense of a “non-refundable” policy — regardless of the false advertising.

Worse still, we were asked to submit a written statement falsely claiming we changed our travel plans — something we refused to do out of principle. This was apparently required to “consider” a refund. We chose not to play along with that narrative and escalated the case to Booking.com.

We travel extensively and are always willing to pay for quality. This was not quality. This was a bait-and-switch disguised as a luxury resort. Avoid at all costs.",Couples

The breakfast buffet has a sufficient selection of local and non local choices.

Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,Sandy toes; sun-kissed nose 😀,"We had a memorable 😀 2-day stay at Taj Bentota Srilanka. The resort is situated in a pristine area, right on a private beach, which provides  a peaceful and scenic retreat. The sea-facing balcony in our room offered breathtaking views — and we clicked lovely photographs showing waves from there!

The swimming pool was the highlight ,many peoples were making reels for their social media. Kids loved the play area, again sea facing, open area. On our first day of stay, face painting was available. The health club was well-equipped with elliptical and treadmill machines, tried my hands for a quick workout.

In the night, there was the lavish dinner spread—a wide variety of dishes, and the Indian food, kadahi paneer to dasi and hopper,  was exceptionally good. Breakfast also impressed us with its extensive variety, kids have a lot of options to select their choice of food.

The bathroom was spotless, stocked with Taj branded toiletries, and the staff service was full of smiles and attentive throughout our 2 days of stay.

We absolutely loved the Desi-style fish served to us during our anniversary dinner at Palm – it was a delightful touch!

A couple of things did take away from the experience. At the beach, no beach beds were available unless we paid extra – which felt a bit unreasonable for such a basic amenity. And during checkout, it was quite odd to find out that LKR and UPI online payments weren’t accepted. It would’ve been helpful to be informed about these payment restrictions earlier.",Family

Colombo,"Taj Samudra, Colombo",4,Exploring new horizons 🇱🇰🎊✨️,"We stayed at Taj Samudra, Colombo, and while the property has its strengths, it didn’t quite match the experience we had at Taj Bentota.

The location is convenient, right in the heart of Colombo and just across from the beach—though it’s important to note that you have to cross a busy road to reach the shore, so it’s not as private or serene as some other Taj properties.

The pool was decent, but felt a bit underwhelming after the stunning one at Taj Bentota. On the plus side, the food was  good, and a special mention goes to the passion fruit jam at breakfast—absolutely delightful!

Our room was neat and comfortable, though we missed having a balcony, especially in a coastal city. Also, the lawns and outdoor areas felt a bit neglected, not quite up to the usually impeccable Taj standards.

In summary, Taj Samudra offers good service and a prime city location, but could benefit from some updates and better outdoor maintenance to truly live up to the Taj brand.",Family

Palatupana,Cinnamon Wild Yala,5,"Glowing Review: Cinnamon Wild, YALA — A Once-in-a-Lifetime Safari Retreat","Cinnamon Wild Yala is, without question, one of the most extraordinary places I’ve ever stayed—and I’ve traveled the world extensively. Tucked on the edge of Yala National Park, it offers a truly immersive nature lodge experience with an unmatched combination of comfort, adventure, and deeply heartfelt hospitality.

The grounds are stunning. I stayed in one of the beachside huts, slightly elevated with the ocean just visible through the lush foliage. Even when you can’t see it clearly, you can hear the waves—soothing and constant. Walking through the property at any time of day or night feels like part of the adventure: peaceful, a little wild, and deeply restorative. The rooms are lovely, spotlessly clean, with powerful air conditioning (a must in the Sri Lankan heat), and the overall environment is carefully maintained without ever feeling sterile. The entire property radiates a respect for nature and quiet luxury.

But the heart of Cinnamon Wild is its people. Every member of the team—from the staff helping guests move safely at night to the restaurant crew and naturalists—was professional, kind, and incredibly competent. I was traveling solo, and never once felt out of place, uncomfortable, or overlooked. Quite the opposite.

One man, in particular, made an unforgettable impression: Saman, who works in the restaurant and bar area near the lobby (not the rooftop). Saman is a gem of a human being—warm, genuine, and generous in a way that can’t be taught. He spoke to me about his children and his life with such honesty and kindness, making me feel completely at home without ever crossing a boundary. It’s rare to find someone so naturally gifted in service and connection. One night, he arranged a private, candlelit dinner for me by the pool—even suggesting I invite my delayed friends—and when I dined alone instead, he made sure I felt relaxed, welcome, and totally cared for. It’s hard to express how much that meant. Cinnamon Wild is incredibly lucky to have him. He embodies what true hospitality is meant to be.

As for the safari experience—this is the real reason to come to Yala, and booking through Cinnamon Wild is absolutely worth it. I paid $200 USD and felt it was a bargain. My experience was private—just me, an expert naturalist, and an incredibly skilled driver, both arranged through the lodge. Their knowledge of the park and its rhythms was astounding. Thanks to them, I had a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with a young female leopard—less than two years old, not yet named. She emerged gracefully and stayed near our vehicle long enough that we shared a real moment. I saw every kind of wildlife I could have hoped for. My friends, who booked outside the hotel for a cheaper rate, were deeply disappointed by comparison.

The Cinnamon Wild safari team doesn’t just “do the drive”—they read the land. Their guide knew exactly where to go, and the driver was not only skilled on Yala’s notoriously rough roads (I was totally comfortable the entire ride), but also respectful of the animals and other guests. This wasn’t tourism—it was reverence.

In short, Cinnamon Wild is a place I would return to in a heartbeat—and send my family and closest friends to without hesitation. It’s rare to find a property that combines this level of natural beauty, comfort, and truly exceptional human care. If you’re considering Yala, don’t think twice. Book Cinnamon Wild—and if you’re lucky, Saman will be there to greet you.",Solo

While the overall experience was excellent, what truly made our stay memorable was the outstanding support from Miss Sohani. She was incredibly attentive, proactive, and ensured every detail—both work-related and personal—was handled smoothly. Her dedication and warm hospitality were truly exceptional.

We also want to highlight the rest of the staff, who were equally supportive, friendly, and quick to respond to any requests. The entire team contributed to a well-organized and comfortable stay. Highly impressed and grateful for the service!",Business

Palatupana,Cinnamon Wild Yala,5,I can't wait to come back!,"This was my first time staying here and I loved every minute of it. From the second I walked in, the staff at the front office were super welcoming and check-in was quick and easy — exactly what I needed after a long trip from Colombo.
I stayed in a Jungle Chalet and it was really spacious, clean, and cozy. You feel so close to nature, it’s honestly such a peaceful vibe.
The safari organized by the hotel was AMAZING — I actually got to see a few leopards which was a huge highlight for me! The Nature Trails team did a great job and made it such a fun experience.
The food was also sooo good — totally worth it. But my favourite part of the whole stay was stargazing at the rooftop restaurant. It was magical! ✨
If you’re thinking of visiting, I’d say go for at least 2 nights — one night is just not enough to take it all in. I just can’t wait to go back!

Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,4,Every destination has a story to tell 🧡🇱🇰🌿,"Our  stay at Cinnamon Citadel Kandy was a relaxing experience in the heart of nature. Set along Sri Lanka’s largest river, the surroundings were incredibly peaceful. The swimming pool overlooking the river offered a stunning backdrop—perfect for unwinding and capturing some amazing photos.

The lavish dinner buffet was excellent, and we especially enjoyed the delicious South Indian options. Breakfast had plenty of variety, catering well to both local and international tastes.

Our room was comfortable and well-equipped, and though it didn’t have an ocean view, the river views were equally calming. The bathroom was clean and stocked with all necessary amenities, and we appreciated the thoughtful service from the friendly staff.

However, one drawback was the lack of a lift. We were assigned a basement-level room, which made going up and down a bit inconvenient, especially with kids.

Overall recommended for river view and lovely gardens.",Family
Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,2,The most underwhelming food experience of our trip,"This property is located in a lovely and calm setting, and we appreciated the peaceful environment. I’m sharing this feedback with the hope that it will be useful for the management to improve the overall guest experience.

Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with several aspects of our stay. There was a persistent drainage smell coming from the bathrooms, which made the rooms unpleasant. We chose this property based on the Cinnamon brand name and the expectation of a luxury experience. However, we felt let down, especially as we had brought guests with us and ended up feeling embarrassed by the quality of the accommodation.

The food experience was particularly disappointing. We ordered afternoon tea, which took over an hour and a half to arrive. Wanting to avoid the buffet, we opted for à la carte in hopes of enjoying authentic Sri Lankan rice and curry. Sadly, this too took over an hour to be served, and the quality was well below expectations. The fish curry was bland, more like boiled fish in salted water, and the other dishes were equally uninspiring. It felt like basic, careless cooking rather than a reflection of Sri Lanka’s rich culinary heritage.

Please pass this feedback on to the chef and kitchen team: authentic Sri Lankan cuisine deserves care, passion, and respect. It’s disheartening to see such a missed opportunity to showcase the country’s gastronomy to visitors.

While the front-of-house staff were friendly and did their best to accommodate us, the overall experience was marred by poor food service and quality. We’ve spent the past month travelling across Sri Lanka and have been consistently impressed by the hospitality and food elsewhere. Sadly, this was our most disappointing experience, and we left with great regret.

We sincerely urge the management to review the à la carte offerings and take immediate steps to elevate the culinary standards. Please don’t let the charm of this beautiful place be overshadowed by subpar food and service.",Family

Staff were next-level friendly. From the welcome drink to remembering my coffee order, they nailed the little things. Breakfast on the terrace was a win—string hoppers, fresh fruit, croissants, all while the river glided by. Evenings by the pool, lanterns glowing, with live music in the background? Perfect vibe.

The hotel is only a quick tuk-tuk ride to the Temple of the Tooth, but it still feels peaceful and away from the city noise. If you want relaxed river views, great food, and warm Sri Lankan hospitality, book Cinnamon Citadel. We’re already planning our next trip back!",Family

Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,3,Standard Cinnamon hotel which doesn't cater so well for A-La-Carte dining.,"I stayed in 3 Cinnamons on recent trip to Sri Lanka, enjoyed this one the least mainly because of the arrival. We arrived Sunday afternoon after hot trip to find the pool absolutely mobbed, no seats/sun-beds and a queueing system in place for a seat. Waited about one hr for a seat to become free (A free beer would have perhaps compensated for that!). Seems on Sundays the pool is open to the public and its packed.  Bad start. Pool was empty on Monday though., seems its just a ""Sunday thing"".  Room was good with scenic view over the river.  Good shower.  Caters to large bus tours and we were a two, so we really wanted to avoid the buffet-style eating with large bus parties which is a bit of a cattle-market.  We were shown to the bar as an alternative but, as others have commented, the seats there are very low and its not really suitable for eating.  We kind of felt like a second class citizens. Buffet breakfast was fine (Same as other Cinnamons), beautiful view onto river. Service was good. It’s not a bad hotel, but if you don’t care for the buffet and arrive on a Sunday, you will be a bit under whelmed.",Couples

Kandy,Radisson Hotel Kandy,5,"Warm, smart people running a fabulous hotel!","The staff and the management here are exceptionally kind and helpful!
My wife has a gluten and dairy allergy and we had informed the hotel prior. They made sure that at every meal, they were physically present to proactively guide on possible options, and ensure the meal yet remains wholesome and has variety. At one point, they didn't have tomato juice readily available, but the FnB Director ensured that they prepare a tomato juice in their kitchen, and get us to try that, if that's good! We were blown away by their warmth!
The rooms were fairly large, with a Balcony, and lovely view of the city and the lake in front....it rained that morning, and we had a lovely view of the rains from the balcony! Lovely restaurant with large spread for breakfast, with a nice sitting area outside as well.

Kandy,Radisson Hotel Kandy,1,Not following the standards expected.,"I am staying at radisson Kandy Srilanka. Had come late due to traffic congestion of 4 hours. So decided order ala carte from room as it was raining outside. 

Called the restaurant and asked for dal and simple roti which they said “not available”. 

They don’t know the difference between buffet and ala carte in properties like radisson. Such properties usually provide food whenever required due to their high standards. 

Escalated the issue to the manager who was on leave and  so explained to duty manager that radisson cannot deny food and order being simple could be arranged. He said will look into the matter. 

Thereafter no one called and then they stopped taking the calls. Finally when we got in touch the restaurant told that they will send but didn’t ask how many rotis which we had to convey.

Later when food came we were shocked to see something else in place of rotis. Such a harassment for long time and non radisson like behaviour.

So would not suggest to stay here. Mean find other similar better property",Family

Palatupana,Cinnamon Wild Yala,5,Hospitality That Went Above and Beyond!,"My friend and I had the absolute pleasure of staying at Cinnamon Wild Yala from June 16th to 18th, and from the moment we arrived, it was an unforgettable experience.

Check-in was a breeze—smooth, welcoming, and full of warm smiles that instantly made us feel at home. Throughout our stay, the staff were consistently friendly, professional, and genuinely helpful. A heartfelt thank you to Devin, Shashika, Pubudu, Sandaruwan, Divya, Ishani, Roshani, and Sandushi – your hospitality was truly exceptional and made our stay so memorable. Keep up the amazing work!

Our room was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The housekeeping team was fantastic—always cheerful and ready to help with anything we needed. We especially loved the cozy beds, the reliable hot and cold water, the well-stocked minibar, and all the little thoughtful touches that made a big difference.

One of the best parts of our trip was just being surrounded by nature. Waking up to birdsong and spotting animals like squirrels, rabbits, crocodiles, deer, and even buffalo right around the property was magical. It really felt like we were part of the wild, in the best way possible.

A highlight for us was definitely the “Crocodile Day” event organized by the Nature Trails team. It was such a well-run and engaging session—complete with snacks, drinks, and fascinating info. Huge thanks to Rohan and the entire Nature Trails crew for making it such a fun and educational experience. We learned so much and really appreciated the effort that went into it.

The food at Cinnamon Wild deserves its own shoutout. Every meal was a treat, thanks to Chef Nandana Perera, Sachini, and the entire kitchen team. Everything was so delicious—we were seriously spoiled!

Special thanks to Sahan, the F&B Manager, and the amazing restaurant team: Himanshi, Champika, Heshan, Ishan, Danushka, and Umesh. And a big thank you to Himal, the Chief Steward, for being so kind and supportive.

I would state there’s something for everyone be aware there is no where else to go so we opted for half board which was perfect for us as breakfast and dinner. The staff are amazing and it all feels very special. While we were there an elephant roamed into the lake right next to the pool and bar area and seemed to enjoy the vegetation and the attention.  We went for a full day safari in yalla national park and we booked through the yalla national park web site page but the hotel runs trips also we would recommend a full day safari if you can we saw leopard’s elephant crocodile almost everything on the list plus lots of other animals it’s literally dripping in animals and really good fun.",Couples

They also graciously packed us a lunch to bring while were out on an all day safari. To this end, I'd say it's worth just booking the all inclusive, as there are no other restaurants around the area. You're going to end up eating there anyway, so save yourself the trouble.

My only complaint is that our guide asked for someone from the hotel to come pick us up by security, as the roads in are extremely bumpy and he was concerned for his sedan. The hotel refused because it wasn't raining that day, and as such, our guide had to trek down a dirt and very bumpy road that wasn't made for cars. Having a service to pick-up guests between all of the hotels would have really made things feel smooth.",Family
Palatupana,Cinnamon Wild Yala,5,Comfort with Adventure,"We visited Cinnamon Wild for 2 nights and wished we had stayed longer. The property is peaceful and surrounded by natural beauty. The highlight was sitting on our chalet deck in the early morning, sipping tea while listening to the jungle sounds. The pool was a great place to relax between safaris, and the rooftop bar has stunning views. The service was excellent—staff always had a smile and offered helpful tips for the park. Thanks Nature Trail Team, Sandushi, Roshani, Sahan, Tharindu and Team.. Huge thanks to Property manager Lasha too.. 
A must-visit if you’re looking to combine comfort with adventure.",Friends

Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,A fabulous stay at a wonderful hotel,"I like to thank each and everyone of the team at Taj Bentota Resort and Spa for such a wonderful and memorable holiday at such a beautiful hotel earlier this month.

 

The hotel has such a lovely team of staff working at the resort and they all helped create a fabulous break for my husband I celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We left on Saturday 7th June with lasting, fond memories and very much looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka again, if not in Bentota, we will definitely book another Taj hotel on the island.

 

We'd also like to extend our gratitude to all the unsung hero's working behind the scenes to create such a beautiful ambiance. The maintenance team, the gardeners, the chefs, they all do a tremendous job ensuring everything works well,  the grounds looking beautiful and the guests fed to such a high standard 

 

The house keeping staff looking after our room were exceptional and the waiters, waitress and guys working around the pool were all so friendly and never without a smile. The reception team were always welcoming and helpful and the security team and the front gate were always ready to greet us no mater what time of day or night.  There are too many names to remember but each and everyone of them deserves recognition for their hard work, enthusiasm and dedication.",Couples

Throughout the day they have different activities for kids too like face painting. Excellent Indian food, with Chef Dalip Singh very happy to customise food the way you want. My kid loved the food. Very courteous and presentable staff, all speak good english. Especially person named Saman was very helpful. Water seeps into the room slightly through the glass doors if it rains heavily, but its not that big a prob. Staff is happy to help. Overall verdict: go for it, wont regret it!",Family
Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,Fabulous hotel with fabulous staff,"Arrived at the hotel around 11am after a very efficient 1h30m transfer from Colombo airport to be greeted by conch blowers and fresh passionfruit juice. Our rooms weren't ready but we're taken through to the lounge and given complimentary refreshments whilst we waited. Travelling with our 20 year old son, we had 2 rooms on the ground floor overlooking the gardens with glimpses of the sea and beach. Rooms spacious with plenty of hanging space but limited for drawers. Comfy bed and complimentary tea/coffee and bottled water replenished daily. Disappointed to only have a shower in the bathroom as we love the Tajs usual deep soaking tubs to relax in. Room was kept spotless by Rukmal and Happy. 

Food as always at the Taj was excellent, wide choice at breakfast and in the evening (we were staying on half board). Chef cooked us a few dishes to try including the best ever chicken tikka and a wonderfully spicy Sri Lankan chicken curry. Service in the restaurant excellent, particularly Asiri, who was professional, friendly and went above and beyond to make our visits special. We enjoyed the cricket chats and the wonderful service. We also dined in the Oriental Pavillion which was superb and the Fish restaurant which was nowhere near as good, service slow and despite informing staff I did not eat fish, was served a fish starter. 

Evenings were quiet in the hotel but free pool tables are a bonus in the bar and staff efficient and friendly.

Pool was mostly tranquil until the British children arrived towards the end of our stay and the constant shouting from Jack, Charlie and Louis caused us to retreat to the beach. No issue getting loungers or parasols and pool team very helpful at all times.

Outside the hotel are a small selection of restaurants and a shop selling soft drinks . About 5 mins walk is the village where there is a supermarket and the liquor shop (supermarket does not sell alcohol). There's a bigger town about 15mins walk away with more choice. We caught the train to Galle for the day which is very straightforward and well worth doing. Outside the hotel are tuk tuks and the drivers will take you wherever fkr a fixed price - we did the Bentota River boat safari and Turtle Sanctuary, both of which are recommended. 

A great hotel with fabulous staff and we can't wait to visit again next year (hopefully staying in a room with a bath!)",Family

Check in experience saved by the wonderful Chaminda who ensured my room was great and then proceeded to suggest where I needed to go for the product manufacturers I was looking for and found me the right driver for the job - Sampath.  As I always travel alone for business I also enjoyed my daily chat with Chaminda who was always keen to see how things were going. 

Sampath went so far as to attend meetings (at my invitation) with me so that he could translate when required and had then provided an invaluable follow up service. 

If I could package the caring nature and service of these two, I’d package it up and recommend it to business customers.

The location is perfect, right across the ocean with breathtaking views and conveniently close to key landmarks in Colombo.

Special thanks and shout out to  to Ms. Thamali Wijesiri and Mr. Samrat Datta who ensured every detail of my stay was perfect and fabulous. We are grateful  to them for  going above and beyond to make our experience so memorable and unforgettable.

  My room was very large with all the amenities and was as clean as could be with a lovely Balcony overlooking the sea which made mornings even more special. The bed was very comfortable and the room service was quick and efficient.
The pool surroundings were calm and well kept and provided an oasis of tranquility in the city. I also liked the green gardens and the feeling of serenity that the premises gives although located in a busy area of Colombo.

I really liked the buffet breakfast and Dinner at POC, a huge variety of local and international dishes.One of the greatest highlight of our stay was the fact that there was Indian vegetarian food available. As vegetarians, we felt quite pleased to get the original and tasty Indian food . A big  thanks to Chef Nair and Chef Anuj. I cannot fail to mention names of Ruwan and Dasum who served not only efficiently but also with a smile which was very impressive.

One can hardly find this kind of commitment and elegance in service, and the staff of Taj actually embodies the gist of Indian and Sri Lankan hospitality.

On the whole, Taj Samudra combines classic style and the service of the international level. I would definitely recommend  it to other business as well as leisure travelers.",Family

Spoke to the manager at Ports of Call, that arrogantly disregarded pretty much everything we mentioned, including that it was that way when we arrived which before anybody had served soup.
Very disappointed to see a so-called five star hotel not even bother to clean their dishes.
Regarding the spread of food - flavorless, bland and without much to imagine.
Had only three types of fruits.
Cannot put into words how disappointing this experience was. How we call this a five star hotel is beyond my wildest understanding.
Side note - the doors in the bathrooms were hanging on to their hinges, the dustbin was overflowing and the food, terrible. 

Brace yourself to see the photo of a dish at a five star hotel.

The check-in process was quick and smooth, and the staff were polite. The room was clean, quiet, and equipped with all the basic amenities needed for a short stay, including a comfortable bed, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and a private bathroom with hot water.

The hotel offers a restaurant with a decent selection of meals and snacks, which was convenient after a long journey. I also appreciated the airport shuttle service, which was punctual and saved me the stress of finding transportation.

Palatupana,Cinnamon Wild Yala,5,A Magical Stay in the Wild 🌿,"I had the pleasure of staying at Cinnamon Wild Yala on the 27th of May for a one-night familiarisation trip with Cinnamon Hotel Management — and honestly, I’ve never felt so welcomed at a hotel before.

Even though we were part of the Cinnamon team, we made it a point to be treated just like any other guest, and the staff absolutely respected that. Their warmth and hospitality were so genuine — it truly felt like home in the middle of the wild. If I had to describe the experience in one word, it would be magical.

From the moment we checked in, everything was smooth and hassle-free. Huge shoutout to Sandushi, Achala, Divya, and Pradeep for making the check-in process so seamless.

The food was incredible, especially the breakfast buffet! Thank you to Chef Manjula and Himal for not only preparing such delicious food but also checking in on us to make sure everything was up to standard — it absolutely was.

Now onto the cocktails... Wow. A massive thank you to Sahan, Amar, and Thamoth — our amazing bartenders. Hands down the best cocktails I’ve had. If you visit, please try the “Jungle Fowl” — it’s an explosion of flavour and leaves you wanting more!

A big thank you as well to our Nature Trails Yala safari guide, Sampath Gunasinghe. Your knowledge, stories, and passion for wildlife added so much to the experience. It made the safari feel personal and inspiring.

And finally, to Resort Manager Lashanthan Gopalan — thank you for being so warm, friendly, and attentive. You have an incredible team who clearly love what they do. It shows in every interaction and creates such a welcoming, authentic vibe.

To anyone who loves wildlife, nature, and a bit of adventure — I couldn’t recommend Cinnamon Wild Yala enough. I’m already looking forward to my next visit!",Business

Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,Family holiday,"We had a wonderful stay at Taj Bentota in April 2025, as part of a special birthday celebration. 

The hospitality and service of Taj staff was second to none and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We made many special requests to accommodate the needs of my mother and all of them were catered for. 

The food was excellent - as you would expect of a Taj hotel! But a very special mention to the chefs Jasveer Singh and Piyush, who went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying the food (we were perhaps the few vegetarians staying at the time) and sent across specially curated plates of vegetarian food for us. 
Breakfast included traditional Sri Lankan, Indian fare along with a continental spread and an omelette station. For dinner we tried the Oriental Pavilion on one occasion, which was really good but limited in choice for vegetarians. We then had a la carte dinner at the main restaurant (when we were indulged with extra plates of food) and the buffet dinner on another occasion. For lunch, we ordered a la carte and ate by the poolside. 

The service at the restaurants even during busy periods such as breakfast and dinner was very efficient. In true Taj Bentota style, no one was ever hurried and took the time to answer queries we had around local outings. Thanks to Sam, Janitha, Dilshan and the rest of the staff! 

The rooms were very comfortable. We had requested two adjoining rooms and we were given a lovely suite. Jinendra, our room cleaner, would add the fun touch to his cleaning by creating towel animals in the rooms. The spa treatments were very relaxing with time before the actual treatment in their steam room, which was a nice treat and the most delicious detox ginger tea after. The concierge staff were very helpful in terms of answering queries and helping us organise trips to see the local area and very accommodative of the requests we made, on behalf of my mum.

Prices do reflect what you would expect at a Taj hotel but then again so does the service and quality. We’ve stayed at many resorts and hotels and the hospitality and service at Taj Bentota is worth mentioning. 

All in all, it was an excellent stay and I would recommend the place to anyone looking for a stay in Bentota.",Family
Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,"Would go again, pleasant stay and ambience.","Initially we had booked 3 nights at Cinnamon bay, needless to say, we shifted to Taj the next day only as we had a terrible experience at Cinnamon bay. Rooms at Taj are sophisticated and property has been well managed. Staff are polite & accommodative. 

Being vegetarians, our experience regarding food has been comfortable across the Taj chain and this was no exception. At Taj Bentota , specially chef. Paramesh Gowda and chef. Dilip Singh made our stay still better & comfortable by making delicious food with lots of affection.",Family
Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,4,Okay but not great,"We stayed for a week. It wasn't the same level as the Taj we are used to (e.g. Taj Village) but it was okay. The housekeeping staff are amazing. Samal was really an asset and I hope they promote him because he has been in the same job for two decades or so. The air conditioning is centrally controlled so there is no way to adjust this. The technician came a few times and then with duty manager but they could not repair it. The duty manager suggested to me that the problem was me as no one else had complained about it! 
All in all the warmth was missing from this hotel. The breakfast was a bit chaotic and if one wanted something, one had to go to the senior staff or chef. 
We also saw the waiter handling the basil leaf on our food by hand, just before laying it on our table. Yuck!
There were some protests outside the hotel from the locals who were complaining about the hotel. There is a train track right next to the hotel so one can hear trains pass by at all hours and of course they honk from time to time. 
The water in the pool was naturally warm and one could swim even if it rained. On one ocassion the staff wanted to go home so they made us come out of the pool on the pretext that they could see the rain approaching but there was no rain.  The other restaurants within the hotel were not really tasty or usable. We tried to go outside but were recommended a very bad, overpriced but terrible tasting restaurant by our tuk tuk guy. The waiters were letching at the small children. Do not go outside to the restaurants around. Potentially try the other luxury hotel nearby which also has their own restaurants. We did not try those. Overall an ok experience but would not be going again.",Family

Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,1,Serious Safety Incident and Disappointing Staff Response at Taj Bentota,"We checked into Taj Bentota yesterday and were initially asked to wait as the room wasn’t ready — which we did patiently. About 30 minutes later, we were informed that the room was ready, though we were cautioned the floors had just been cleaned and would dry in five minutes. Since it was lunchtime, we decided to head to the restaurant first and returned to the room about 20 minutes later.

Within minutes of entering, my wife slipped in the bathroom due to a pool of water left on the floor, which had clearly not been dried properly. She sustained a painful sprain and a deep cut on her arm, requiring medical attention. The injury disrupted our plans for the remainder of our stay.

What made matters worse was the hotel’s lack of urgency or compassion. When she called guest services to report the incident, the executive was dismissive and abruptly ended the call. We had to escalate the matter ourselves, eventually speaking with the General Manager, Mr. Sibi Matthew. Instead of acknowledging the seriousness of the lapse, he attempted to offer inducements — which felt inappropriate — rather than expressing genuine concern or accountability.

We’ve always associated the Taj brand with high standards of care and hospitality, having stayed with them for over 25 years. Unfortunately, our experience at Taj Bentota fell well short. The poor housekeeping, lack of supervision, and unprofessional handling of a safety incident have cost us two out of three days of what should have been a relaxing holiday.

I would urge future guests to exercise serious caution. We expected better — especially from a brand like Taj.",Family
Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,5,"A holiday ,we will always remember..","Our recent family vacation at Taj Bentota Resort & Spa was excellent ,the ideal combination of natural beauty, elegance, and friendly hospitality.

From the minute we arrived, the staff greeted us with  warm smiles and  Sri Lankan hospitality.

We enjoyed a fantastically smooth and welcoming check-in experience at Taj Bentota. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient, and we felt right at home. 
A heartfelt thank you to the check-in staff, Ms. Nilusha, for  smooth check in.

The  location is spectacular, directly on the beach with breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. The hotel is wonderfully designed, with lush gardens, a relaxing pool area, and direct beach access for long, tranquil walks. 
 Our room was spacious, very clean, and well-maintained, with a private  sea view big balcony . Housekeeping performed an excellent job . The beds were really comfy, and room service was efficient and pleasant.
 As vegetarian tourists, we sometimes struggle to find variety and flavour while dining overseas but Taj Bentota exceeded all of our expectations.
The resort provides an excellent assortment of Indian and International vegetarian food, both at the buffet and ala carte. Every dish was freshly prepared and very tasty. 
The chefs were more than happy to accommodate our food choices  and we felt genuinely cared for and a major reason for that was the outstanding culinary experience, led by the incredibly talented Executive Chef Piyush Mishra.  I express my heartfelt gratitude to him for making our stay memorable, taking the time to understand our food choices and ensuring that each meal was a lovely experience.
A special thank-you and shout out to the Indian chef Dilip Singh whose cooking  made us feel at home. From delicious curries to  tasty South Indian items at breakfast,we enjoyed every bit of it.
I cant miss out to mention names of Maduka ,Bimal , Ruwan,and Janitha who not only served with efficiency but also with a smile, which made a lasting impression.

Overall, Taj Bentota is an ideal blend of nature, comfort, and elegance, complemented by Taj's hallmark hospitality. We are already looking forward to returning! Highly recommended for romantic and family getaways.",Family
Bentota,Taj Bentota Resort & Spa,1,Absolutely inhuman and insensitive staff - DO NOT STAY HERE!,"We checked into the Taj Bentota today. A loyal Taj customer and a shareholder I was expecting a pleasant experience, as I usually have experienced.

As the room was not ready, we waited for over 45 minutes after which we were told that the room was ready but the bathroom was wet and would dry up in 5 minutes.

However since our toddler was hungry, we did not head to the room instead it to the restaurant. After a quick light meal that took about 20 minutes, we headed back to the room and my wife visited the toilet.

Instead of experiencing a dry floor, they was stagnant water on which my wife slipped and had a long cut on her arm. 

Guest services was dismissive about about this, no regret, and rather the lady abruptly disconnected the call.

We were offered a visit to the doctor and a first aid kit, however, the first aid kit did not have a disinfectant which is necessary for cleaning up such a wound or a cut.

After a while, the general manager, Siby Matthew came to meet us, wanting us to calm down, offering to make up for the horrendous experience. We were enticed with better service room, upgrades, blah blah blah.

It smacked of insincerity and a lack of ownership. This was absolutely criminally negligent to let a guest check in when the room is not in a position to accept visitors and to top it all the attitude of guest services to bang the phone and not having a well stocked first aid kit. This is nothing but criminally negligent behavior that the management of IHCL has to take notice of.

As a loyal Taj customer for over 25 years and Ash shareholder was stood by you through the troughs of Covid, you have already broken my trust and faith.

I would definitely not recommend this property to anyone even my worst enemy.",Family

Kandy,Radisson Hotel Kandy,5,Radisson Hotel Kandy More than just a view.,"Staying at the Radisson Hotel in Kandy was one of the highlights of my trip. The hotel offers a stunning top lake view that’s simply unforgettable peaceful, scenic, and perfect for unwinding.

One of the best surprises was the Global Gem Hub, a gem shop located away at the back of the hotel lobby. It may be easy to miss, but it’s a true treasure. The prices here are much more affordable compared to outside shops, and the quality of the gems is exceptional.

What really stood out was the staff .the salesmen are genuinely trustworthy and honest, which is a rare and refreshing experience when shopping for gems. They took the time to explain everything and made me feel confident in my purchase without any pressure.

With incredible views, comfortable accommodations, and the bonus of a reliable gem shop right inside, Radisson Kandy offers a complete and memorable experience. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting this beautiful city!",Business

Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,1,F & B MANAGER @ CINNAMON CITADEL WITH A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE,"I stayed @ Cinnamon Citadel with a French Incentive group of 106 persons / 57 rooms (from 07th to 08th May 2025) 
Unfortunately a considerable number of guests complained about the accommodation of the hotel as most of the top floor rooms were flooded due to leakage of it's roof due to heavy rains. I had to find alternative rooms together with front office staffs and hotel was also running almost full house on the same day.
Somehow with greatest difficulties, we managed to get the alternative rooms arranged and matter was sorted.
However this type of a situation cannot be accepted at all with so called ""Cinnamon Properties""

As this was an incentive group and whole tour was with Cinnamon properties (Lodge, Trinco Blu & Cinnamon Citadel) we have arranged a cultural dance show at the hotel (arranged and paid by the Travel Company) and venue was approved in written format by the Assistant FOM. 
In spite of all those, the F & B Manager (Nalin or Naleem) came and spoke to me in a very rowdy manner with an unacceptable attitude. Then I clearly informed him that I do not want to have any conversation with him. 
However, except him, the other F & B staffs were very cooperative and did everything which they could do to make the group happy.",Business
Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,2,"Underwhelming, poor service","Not worth it.
You come to Cinnamon Citadel expecting greatness but it just leave you wanting.
Starting with the positives - Christina at the reception is really helpful and can really brighten up your day. The orange cordial is amazing and so is the location of the pool and the bar but the buck stops here.
The service or whatever they may want to call it is pathetic to say the least. We were travelling with a baby and they were least accommodative in all their efforts. Ask them for fresh apples or cookies or dates and all they can say is that we don’t have them and the next minute they shall be serving the same to someone else.
The worst part, we asked for water on the first night at around 10pm and they stated that everything is closed and we shall not be able to provide.
A blemish on hospitality is what Cinnamon Citadel Kandy truly is.",Family

The hotel is beautifully located by the Mahaweli River, offering stunning views and a peaceful atmosphere – perfect for a romantic getaway.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and taken care of. The staff was exceptional throughout our stay. We especially want to thank Jaliya ,Srimali & Thiloka, along with the entire team, for their outstanding service and genuine hospitality. They made us feel very special and comfortable.

The food was absolutely delicious, with a great variety of choices, and we really enjoyed every meal. Our room was spacious, clean, and very cozy – just what we needed for a relaxing honeymoon.

Overall, it was a fantastic stay, and we’re so happy we chose Cinnamon Citadel for this special day. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Kandy.

Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,2,Needs a lot of Ironing,"Booked for one night with the sole purpose of getting away from the hassle in the city with a bit of nature. Served the purpose... up to a certain extend. I would say, the ambiance is amazing. Mountains, the river and the quite surroundings are a definite seller. Balcony was private, spacious and peaceful. Take a bit of effort and the rest can be amazing too.

I won't say the whole experience was unsavory but the bitter bits were avoidable without any effort at all. At first, I tried to reach the hotel for two days and no one picked up. Messages went unanswered. When they finally decided to pick the telephone, on the third day, it was after 6 or 7 rings.. I was shocked. 3 rings is the golden rule. At check in, I was told that the information provided over the phone was slightly incorrect. I had to stand on my grounds for the reception staff to accept the fact that it's either stick to what I was told or I walk out. 

Walked into the room, beautiful, spacious and very cozy room. Well arranged and spotless. Loved the interior. Alas, the bed was two twins made as twin beds, for a couple booking!!!! The reason given was, we upgraded you... I did not come to stay  as a hotelier, I came as a guest and to forget about work. At the end I had to think as a hotelier and ask the staff to convert the bed to a Double using the bedding. One of the very first things every hotelier does when the occupancy is high. And the staff didn't think of it.. Blasphemy.  

There were some minor maintenance issues, almost unnoticeable. But the balcony door wasn't one of them. The rollers were not working. Only one side could be opened properly. The curtains had clearly visible stains and the headrest of the bath was either moldy or worn out. AC was blowing the whole night. I understand it's a 4 star but none of the four stars in my cluster will dream of selling a room with these conditions.

Room Service was closed by 11pm I think. Given the location of the hotel, not having a 24*7 room service is a bit of a turn off. When we ordered room service the next morning, it took more than 30 minutes for the food to arrive. 

The staff clearly needs to be trained on telephone etiquette. You don't hang up on a guest in the middle of a conversation. Happened all the four times we called. Looks like the majority of the staff are trainees. The boy who came to convert the bed was scared to talk, the girl at the reception withered when I spoke in a firm tone. 

Invoice does not show the base price and tax. I had to ask why am I charged extra for the minibar cos it did look like an extra charge. The receptionist had to explain that the price is including tax. Not the best approach when it comes to billing. 

When I book into a Four Seasons , I expect the standards of the chain regardless of the location or the star rating. When I booked Cinnamon, I expected the standards of the Cinnamon. Painfully, it wasn't the case. I was disappointed. 

Clearly, the place needs more attention to match the price tag.",Couples
Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,2,Had its day,Very poor arrival well after check in time room not ready so they gave us any room … sure not what we paid for.

It is a wonderful hotel with delightful landscaped gardens and a superb pool. We had a mini suite on the ground floor with fabulous views over the Mahaweili River Estuary which was teaming with wildlife such as birds and fish. The hotel fixtures and fittings are very modern and it has obviously been updated since some of the reviews from the last decade. The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful and the food and service were fabulous. They even went as far as to lay on a special shellfish banquet next to the river on Valentine’s evening. Reception were very helpful at organising excursions or arranging for Tuk-Tuks to visit local attractions.

Kandy,Radisson Hotel Kandy,5,Our first but certainly not our last!,"This was our first visit to a Raddison in Sri Lanka, and it was a wonderful stay

The room was adequately spacious but a bit too small for a triple. Maybe there was another bed, and that did hamper the space inside the room.

The pool and bar were on the top terrace, and it was very scenic and served up good nibbles and cocktails. A good mix of signature cocktails was also available. Beer and other liquors were also served

The food was also delicious, and we tried some signature cocktails (Raddison Heat and Raddison Fever) were also exceptional. The atmosphere was elevated with music from the 5 piece calipso and the  guests who were dancing to their lovely tunes.

The road leading to the hotel entrance has a school, and it was blocked because of the haphazard parking of the trishaws, school vans, and parent's vehicles. The hotel should guide these culprits to be more disciplined as it is bad publicity to the hotel and Sri Lanka if this is not addressed. I actually turned back on my first attempt as it was blocked and assumed I had taken a wrong entrance and on my second attempt it was again blocked and it took 15 to 20 minutes and a lot of circumspective driving of 300m to reach the hotel. This should be resolved quickly before it is escalated to a more unbecoming situation. Law enforcement should take action to resolve this if everything else fails

But that is external and besides the stay was wonderful nevertheless. 

I will definitely contempt another visit and will recommend the Raddison Kandy to everyone!

Thank you, Raddison Kandy!!",Family

Lovely big open lobby area with bar overlooking the pool and the forest across the river, lovely to sit in the evenings. Nice pool and seating area.

Jayantha, in the restaurant, was the only person who made me feel like a person, not an inconvenience. He remembered that I liked ice water and was always happy.
I was there for the New Year Festival, and it was lovely to see local Sri Lankan life.",Solo
Kandy,Cinnamon Citadel Kandy,4,"Another surprisingly poor welcome, is it me?","The Citadel was our last stop before flying home, so I guess we had been spoiled elsewhere as we found this more like a transit stop than anything. Having said that the buffet food was extensive and of high quality. The rooms were good size, except perhaps the first floor balconies. Again,  a moan about the disinterested manager who 'welcomed' us at the start of our visit. He was clearly on another planet, tried to hand us a couple of Iranian passports (presumably trying to get rid of us?) and then did the bored, rattled off intro, might have well not bothered, it wasn't a great welcome. Even our driver guide was surprised. However, the hotel is well placed for the sights of Kandy, so well worth considering.",Couples

We booked the Deluxe Suite with a private pool, and it was amazing. Super spacious, beautifully designed, and had the most incredible direct view of the ocean – waking up to that every morning was something special. The whole villa had such a peaceful, luxurious vibe.

A big shoutout to our personal butler, Rushan, who really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. He was always there when we needed anything, super friendly, and really made us feel at home.

The food was excellent too – every meal was delicious and there was a great variety to choose from. Whether we were dining by the pool or in the restaurant, the quality and service were spot on.

We truly loved every bit of our stay and are already talking about coming back – hopefully for a longer visit next time. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to relax and treat yourself!",Couples
Bentota,"Jetwing Saman Villas, A Luxury Reserve",5,The Most Magical Proposal. A Truly Unforgettable Stay at Saman Villas.,"I had planned a surprise proposal for my girlfriend, and Saman Villas turned what could have been a stressful day into an unforgettable, magical experience. From the moment we arrived, the team went above and beyond to make sure everything went exactly to plan.

Every detail was flawlessly executed, our room was perfectly located, the flowers were kept fresh and cool, and the dinner setting was beyond perfect. The staff paid attention to even the smallest details, like tailoring the menu to our specific tastes and adding dishes simply because my fiancée mentioned a craving. We were also surprised with a celebratory cake upon our return visit, a thoughtful gesture that truly touched us.

Special thanks to General Manager Mr. Farrel, who took time out of his busy day to check in on us, reassure me when I had last-minute nerves, and ensure everything unfolded seamlessly. Mr. Badde, our butler, was incredible, no request was too small, and every detail was handled with care and precision to make our stay truly perfect. Even the cleaning staff went the extra mile by preparing our room during dinner so we could return to a space ready for a restful night.

What makes Saman Villas stand out isn’t just the luxury, but the sincerity and warmth of the people. Their dedication to sustainability is also evident throughout the property, from the eco-friendly amenities in the room to the thoughtful practices observed during our stay.

Saman Villas will always hold a special place in our hearts. It’s more than a resort, it’s an experience that blends serenity, luxury, and genuine hospitality. We’ll return every time we visit Sri Lanka, and I can’t recommend this property enough to anyone seeking an extraordinary escape.",Couples

Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,5,A Soulful Stay in the Heart of Jaffna – Jetwing is Hospitality Redefined,"I rarely write reviews this long, but my experience at Jetwing Jaffna truly deserves every word—and more.

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I wasn’t treated like a guest—I was welcomed like family. There's something beautifully genuine about the way the entire team connects with you. 

It’s not just hospitality here—it’s heartfelt care. Every need was anticipated, every request met with warmth and flexibility, and every interaction made me feel completely at home.

Let me begin by applauding the leadership of Mr. Sujeeva, the hotel manager. Calm, courteous, and incredibly hands-on, his quiet dedication reflects in every corner of the hotel. 

Whether it was a special meal request or a last-minute change in our schedule, his team's responsiveness and Mr. Sujeeva’s attention to detail made our stay seamless and memorable.

Special gratitude to the exceptional concierge staff:

•Mr. Prasad, with his encyclopedic local knowledge and thoughtful recommendations, made every outing in Jaffna a meaningful experience.

•Ms. Mathumitha, whose gentle kindness and ever-present smile brought a special warmth to every interaction.

•Mr. Jeeva, so quietly efficient and considerate—his service came from the heart, not a script.

They didn’t just assist us; they cared for us. That’s something no star rating can measure.

The rooms were immaculate, with modern touches blended beautifully with Jaffna’s cultural elegance. From the window,
 I watched the town pulse with quiet energy—temples, tuk-tuks, and trees swaying in the coastal breeze. It felt peaceful and alive at the same time.

The food was extraordinary. Every meal was a celebration of northern Sri Lankan cuisine—spicy, soulful, and unforgettable.

 I had a few dietary preferences, and the kitchen was wonderfully flexible and thoughtful. It's rare to see this level of attention even in high-end hotels.

Above all, what stayed with me most was the sense of being looked after like family. Jetwing Jaffna isn’t about luxury for the sake of it—it’s about comfort, community, and care. 
If you're traveling to the north of Sri Lanka, you’re not just visiting a place—you’re stepping into a rich culture and warm hospitality. And there’s no better base than Jetwing Jaffna.

To Mr. Sujeeva, Mr. Prasad, Ms. Mathumitha, and Mr. Jeeva thank you for making my trip unforgettable. 
You are the heart of this hotel.",Friends

On the day of arrival we  were very fortunate to have met Mr Amaran a Senior Manager there. He was very friendly and professional. When he heard that it was our first visit and wanted to visit our late Parents homes, he went the extra mile to brief our driver on the route to take etc. It was a wonderful gesture and we managed to find their homes.

Nuwara Eliya,The Bellwood Manor,5,A world class stay in the misty mountains of Sri Lanka,"Bellwood Manor was such a delight! The estate is beautiful and the rooms are large and comfortable. It was nice having a small electric heater fireplace in the room as the weather was chillier than expected since you are up in the mountains. A very different climate than we came from in Colombo. The experience feels like being a guest in the home of a friend (a very well-to-do friend) more than a hotel because the stay is so warm and welcoming. 

Every meal in the restaurant was a delight. (You must try the Sri Lankan breakfast.) Janaka provided wonderful service and we were always given way more food than we could eat but wished we could finish it because the flavors were so good. Not just the taste but also the presentation of each dish was well done. 

The private sauna experience in the spa was a nice, relaxing surprise. While I did not personally take advantage of the other spa services, my husband enjoyed his Vietnamese massage. 

The ability to communicate with the staff via WhatsApp proved very convenient and Staicy was always prompt, polite, and helpful in her responses. 

Since we visited during the rainy season we hired a car to drive us around to the tea plantations and waterfalls. If we had wanted to walk to town, it would have only been a short 10 minute walk but we wanted to see some of the sights a bit further out. 

I highly recommend Bellwood Manor on your next visit Nuwara Eliya.",Couples

Highly, highly recommend Bellwood Manor. We’ll definitely be back!",Family
Nuwara Eliya,The Bellwood Manor,5,Surprisingly amazing,"Excellent hotel and even better staff. I had my doubts about the hotel despite excellent rating. 

Ambience 
In the middle of the Nuwara Eliya yet peaceful. Most points / places to visit (except tea estates and farms) are walking distance. 

Rooms
Spacious airy. Modern yet with old colonial charm.
Rooms have most amenities available in regular hotels.

Staff 
Courteous, friendly and caring. A big shout out to Stacy and Janaka who made our stay even more comfortable. Stacy is helpful, knows her brief and whilst toeing hotel policies still manages to make your stay more comfortable and fun. Janaka was always around - he followed our food requests to the T. 
Irshad without hesitating subscribed to a channel we wanted. It was amazing no questions asked - you are our guest you want it we will get it (for reasonable requests).

Food and Restaurant 
The best hoppers I have had ever. Super light and delicious. Our first time experience of 4 course breakfast - local fruits, granola with curd, hoppers with 4 curries and 2 sambals least course tea/ coffee/milk. 
We were asked our food preferences / dietary restrictions they were followed. 

The three course dinner was amazing! 

Only down side they don’t have 24 hour kitchen - so if you are the kinds who has food cravings middle of the night not sure if this place is for you. 

Amenities 
Plunge pool cum jacuzzi, steam room and sauna room. All three are situated in the out house with the spa. Only issue we faced was that the pool, steam and sauna were in such a small area that the steam from the steam room hits you on the face (whilst in plunge pool) if anyone opens it’s door.

I would not recommend the jacuzzi being on if you have young children who are also going to enter the pool with you. As the chlorine in the water and pressure from the jacuzzi spouts can make their eye really burn.

They have bicycles and also offer horse riding for a price. 

The horse rides and horse care takers were both very good. The first say they took us up the single tree mountain and next day they offered to take us on a different route through the race course and ‘forest’. The price u thought was high but after enquiring rates at tourist points it wasn’t that bad plus these horse rides are with people known to the hotel sand arranged through themso it’s better.

Conclusion 
Worth a stay if you don’t have young children with you.",Family

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,5,Shangri-La Colombo – A Luxurious Escape for the Solo Traveler,"Shangri-La Colombo – A Luxurious Escape for the Solo Traveler

I recently spent two nights at the Shangri-La Colombo at the end of my journey along Sri Lanka’s South Coast. I genuinely wish I had stayed longer. As with every Shangri-La property I’ve visited, this one delivered exceptional service and luxurious comfort from start to finish.

Arrival & First Impressions

From the moment I arrived, the front desk staff greeted me warmly, offering a refreshing cold drink—a much-needed touch after a long flight. The lobby and reception area were stunning, with a grand, elegant atmosphere that immediately made me feel pampered. Staff were always around, attentive without being intrusive, and genuinely hospitable. Their consistent presence and helpfulness made me feel supported throughout my stay.

Room & Upgrade Perks

Thanks to my American Express Platinum benefits, I received an upgraded room along with a $150 USD credit at CHI, The Spa. My room was nothing short of luxurious, with a super comfortable bed, a spacious bathroom, and a beautiful walk-in shower. The ambiance and decor reflected a calming, high-end aesthetic that was perfect for unwinding after travel.

CHI, The Spa Experience

I fully maximized the spa credit with a 90-minute deep tissue massage—an intense yet much-needed treatment. I honestly think the masseuse broke me (in the best possible way). It was powerful, therapeutic, and exactly what my body needed. I also added a collagen face mask and a hot oil hair treatment, which left me feeling refreshed and cared for. I wanted to book more treatments, but they were fully booked, and my time was limited—so I highly recommend making reservations early. A special shout out to Geethma at CHI Spa, very friendly, front desk staff who organized everything with a beautiful smile.

Breakfast & Dining

Breakfast was included in my stay and featured a generous buffet with both Sri Lankan and Western dishes. I sampled local favorites like dosai, idly, hoppers, uppuma, and curries, alongside more familiar options like eggs, bacon, sausages, and cereals.

A quick heads-up for fellow travelers—Sri Lankan breakfasts are not shy with spice, which gave my morning a real kickstart! That said, I found some of the food, like the milk hoppers, a bit bland. They tasted more like plain hoppers; adding more coconut milk and a hint of jaggery or sugar would have made a big difference. Overall, the buffet leaned slightly toward a mass-produced flavor, and I think a bit more attention to seasoning could elevate the culinary experience.

Pool, Location & Facilities

The 4th-floor pool area was a highlight, offering breathtaking views of the ocean and city. I arrived just in time to catch an incredible sunset, which made the experience all the more memorable.

The hotel is directly connected to the One Galle Face Mall, making it super convenient for shopping and dining. While I felt the mall could benefit from a better mix of stores, the convenience factor was a big plus. I also appreciated that the surrounding area felt safe and walkable, even at night.

Nightlife & Exploring Colombo

One evening, I took a relaxing 10-minute walk to the Honey Beach Club, a nearby bar and nightclub. It wasn’t very lively midweek (I was there from Wednesday through Friday), but I imagine it picks up more on weekends. Still, the walk itself was pleasant, and the hotel’s location makes it easy to hop in a Tuk Tuk or car to explore other nightlife options around Colombo.

Final Thoughts

As a solo traveler, I couldn’t have asked for a more seamless and indulgent experience. From the outstanding hospitality to the comfort and elegance of the room, and the rejuvenating spa treatments, the Shangri-La Colombo provided the perfect end to my Sri Lanka journey.

While a few elements—particularly some of the buffet dishes—could use refinement, the overall experience was luxurious, welcoming, and thoughtfully designed. I felt completely safe, cared for, and relaxed throughout my stay.

If you're traveling solo and looking for a blend of elegance, convenience, and personal care, I highly recommend Shangri-La Colombo. It exceeded my expectations—and then some.",Solo

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,5,"Luxurious Ambience, Impeccable Style","From the moment I entered Shangri-La Colombo, the luxury vibe was unmistakable. The hotel effortlessly blends modern elegance with warm hospitality, making it an ideal destination for high-end events and memorable photo opportunities. Every corner, from the grand lobby to the wedding halls, exudes class — it’s truly a visual treat for anyone who appreciates sophistication and style. The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of Colombo with sweeping views and easy access. The neatness and attention to detail were impressive — everything felt pristine, polished, and thoughtfully designed. And of course, the cuisine was a highlight — diverse, flavorful, and beautifully presented. 
One minor issue, however, was with the parking process. Guests entering for weddings or events should be clearly informed (at the entrance or via signage) that a parking pass is required to avoid payment. I had to return to the event hall  just to obtain one, which could’ve been avoided with better guidance. Despite this, the overall experience was top-tier — a perfect blend of elegance, atmosphere, and exceptional service. Would definitely recommend for events, stays, or just soaking in Colombo’s finest luxury.",Friends

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,1,"Disappointing experience at the Shangri-La, Colombo","We booked a “triple room” at the Shangri-La, Colombo, which was accepted by Shangri-La and of course paid for as a triple however, what we received was a small, old, bed pushed into the corner of a double room. There was no room left for one person to get off the double bed, as the rollaway bed was squeezed in. This is definitely not what would be classed as triple, although it was booked and charged as one.
Although feedback was provided to Shangri-La (Colombo), these were simply dismissed. We were told that Shangri-La does not have triple rooms, so to accommodate triple room requests they simply put a rollaway bed, with no thought to the placement of this bed in the room. I am not certain which storeroom they dug out the old, dusty, rollaway bed from. The “bed” was still partially covered in sticky tape and bits of plastic and was not what I expected from a five-star hotel. We stayed at several 5-star hotels during our trip to Sri-Lanka in April 2025, including the Galle Face hotel and never encountered such poor service.
What I expected from a hotel of this caliber is to attend to our concerns, view our room and see if anything could have been improved.

Avudangawa,Aliya Resort & Spa,5,"A calm, pleasant spot with great staff","This hotel is set in a peaceful natural area that’s perfect if you’re looking to relax and take a break. It’s not the kind of place with dramatic views or luxury features, but the surroundings are quiet and refreshing—trees, open sky, and the kind of calm that makes you slow down without trying. It’s a good choice if you want a simple, relaxing stay away from the noise.

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and have all the basics you need. Nothing too fancy, but everything works well and feels thoughtfully put together. There’s a sense that the place is cared for, both inside and out.

What really stands out is the staff. Everyone we met was friendly, down-to-earth, and helpful without being overbearing. Whether you needed directions, tips on where to go nearby, or just a quick chat, they were always ready with a smile. It felt more like being welcomed by hosts than just checking into a hotel.

Overall, this is a great spot if you want somewhere simple, peaceful, and well-run. The setting is gentle and natural, and the people make it even better. Would definitely return for a quiet weekend away.",Solo

Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",2,Caution!,"We were booked to stay here in the roof top villa room for 4 nights.  We have stayed in lots of different places over the years and this is the first time we have ever decided not to stay.

On entry, the hotel was lovely with a real wow factor and walking into the gardens was so peaceful. We were then taken to our room which we knew was at the very bottom of the garden - we were taken by tuk tuk (back out of the hotel grounds onto the main road and then quite a way down a couple of back alleys).  On asking where the path through the garden was for us to walk to the main part of the hotel (either for breakfast or in the evenings) we were told there was a dispute with the neighbour who had locked a gate meaning we could not walk through the garden and we would have to use the route the tuk tuk had taken.  This was a good 10 minute walk; at night the alleyways were pitch black (several potholes, dogs and dog poo) and the main road extremely busy.  We in no way felt like we were part of the hotel and felt very remote. We were also advised the hotel were not offering evening meals (as advertised).  All of these things were advised to us very factually rather than as an apology.

The room was advertised as being accessed by 2 sets of stairs (what it didn’t mention was that one set were extremely steep, up a narrow space with no handrail and then at the top you actually access the room through a hatch, similar to a boat).  To lock our room we had to use a chain and padlock.  There were lots of monkeys to see from the room but do be aware that as from about 6am they are extremely noisy jumping on the roof and the room is very light as several of the windows had missing blinds.

Once we had seen our room we did ask if we could change room into the main part of the hotel but they were fully booked and we therefore made the decision to stay overnight (by then it was getting late) and leave the next day.

I rarely write a bad review as I appreciate things can go wrong and I feel it’s how they are dealt with that is important but on this occasion I feel the review is justified. We should have received prior notice about the path being closed (and evening meals not being served) so we could make our own decision whether to change our booking without losing time on our holiday having to make alternative arrangements and find different accommodation.  Also, I think the access to the room should be made much clearer prior to booking.  Whilst we had no issues, others may struggle with the steepness of the stairs with no rail and getting in and out using the hatch style door. 

It does appear to be a nice hotel and very peaceful considering how busy Marissa is but care should certainly be taken when making a room selection.",Couples

Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",4,Beautiful hotel in Mirissa,"The Spice House is a very beautiful hotel; our room was lovely and the pool area was lovely and relaxing. 

We stayed just for one night, but the owner took the time to meet us on arrival and talk through her recommendations regarding the local area, including restaurants and activities. 

We had a whale watching trip booked, so we were leaving early in the morning which meant we'd miss breakfast, but the owner prepared a little take-away breakfast for us to take on the boat which was such a nice touch and we really appreciated it. However, one thing we wanted to mention is the owners response to our whale watching trip that we had booked in advance. It was very clear they had a preferred tour company, which was not the one we had chosen to go with, and they were quite negative about them and made suggestions for us to go with another company. Although I am sure the owner had good intentions and just wanted us to have an enjoyable time, it did make us feel a bit uncomfortable and we did worry we had chosen a bad tour company. However, we stuck to our guns and continued our boat tour with the company we booked with and we are glad we did because we had a great time. I would perhaps say to the owners that if they felt another provider is better, they could have contacted us prior to our stay to recommend the other company as telling us the day before just made us feel quite anxious.",Couples

The lush flora and tiered gardens are stunning, and while there are a few monkeys nearby, they’re not a bother. The lovely pool offers a perfect view of the gardens. That evening, we dined at Ruwan’s recommended local restaurant, Petti Petti, where the food and service were excellent. Tuk-tuks are easily accessible for getting around. The morning’s breakfast is delightful, featuring tea/coffee, fresh fruit, fruit juice, a traditional savoury, toast & condiments and even a piece of chocolate cake, making us reluctant to leave.

Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,LOVED IT,"This place is amazing. We stayed in the Clove Cottage which was rustic but beautiful. It was very private with a balcony that looked out over the jungle. The gardens were beautiful with lots of different colours of the native plants. There were lots of monkeys, squirrels, peacocks and beautiful birds to keep us entertained. The staff were fantastic. They would always stop and speak to you to ask how you were going, what you were doing that day and if there was anything they could do for us. They were the absolute best. The breakfast was different everyday with a mixture of Western and traditional. They did the best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten. The pool was nice and warm so easy to get into and overlooked the beautiful gardens. 
The beach is just across the road and town is a 5 minute walk or a quick Tuk Tuk ride. There are plenty of places close by to eat or drink.
My only negative is the roof over the balcony keeps the breeze out and makes it a bit hotter but I understand the roof would be perfect if it was raining so it's not really a negative.
I would recommend this place in a heart beat and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay here so enjoyable. 
If we ever go back to Mirissa would never stay anywhere else.

Colombo,Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo,5,"An unforgettable experience at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo","Our stay at the **Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel** in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional, and we were fortunate enough to stay here twice—once when we first landed in Colombo, and later when we had a layover before our flight the following day. Both times, the experience was truly memorable, and this hotel has now become one of our favorites.

Nestled beautifully on the bank of **Beira Lake**, the hotel’s location is perfect, offering a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the city. Surrounded by the modern skyline of high-rise buildings, including other major hotels, the view from this property is simply breathtaking. It is a stunning blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty, and the moment we arrived, we felt the luxurious yet welcoming atmosphere.

The check-in process was impressively smooth and high-tech, handled entirely on an iPad, which was a refreshing experience. Special thanks to the young trainee, **Mr. Dulimina**, and his manager, **Mr. John**, who went above and beyond to offer us a lake-view room. Their hospitality was top-notch, and we were thrilled with our room.

The room itself was spacious and pristine, offering a spectacular view of the **swimming pool**, **Beira Lake**, and the majestic **Lotus Tower**, which can be seen in all its grandeur, especially at night when it lights up in dazzling colors. The nighttime view of the Lotus Tower from our room was simply enchanting, making the entire stay feel magical.

The housekeeping team did a fantastic job, keeping the room spotless throughout our stay. We were especially happy with the attentive service, as we were provided with water bottles whenever we needed them, even late into the evening.

The **breakfast and dinner** experiences were absolutely WOW! The **Sri Lankan cuisine**—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—was superb, and the hotel’s elaborate menu of **Indian, Asian, and Italian** dishes left us spoilt for choice. Every meal was a delightful treat, and we truly enjoyed the variety and the delicious flavors.

One of the best things about this hotel is its **central location**. It’s close to local pubs, restaurants, and popular tourist spots like the **Dutch Museum**, which was one of our favorites to explore. Another highlight for us was the **live music** played at the bar, located right in the lobby. Sipping drinks while enjoying the tunes and overlooking the swimming pool made for the perfect relaxing evening.

During our stay, we also had the pleasure of experiencing some amazing events. One memorable night was the **Saturday dance and fun event** hosted by the hotel. It’s a plush event for outside guests, but for hotel guests, entry is free—though drinks are extra. It was a great way to wind down and enjoy the lively atmosphere. As a bonus, we had the chance to meet members of the **Sri Lanka and Bangladesh women’s cricket teams**, who were staying at the hotel, and we even witnessed a beautiful **Sri Lankan wedding** taking place. These unexpected extras added so much to our experience, making it all the more memorable.

Finally, we have to extend a big thank you to **Joshua**, **Tharushi**, and **Madhushikha** from the restaurant, who welcomed us with such warmth and smiles every time we dined there. Their kindness and service made our stay even more enjoyable.

Overall, our experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was absolutely wonderful, and we will **definitely return** to stay here again. The hotel’s mix of luxurious comfort, superb location, and outstanding hospitality has won us over. We can't wait to come back!",Couples

Colombo,Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo,5,Located near everything,"After arriving before midnight and an hours trip from the airport, we arrived here where I was staying for the next 2 nights. Funny, explosive vapour detector at the gate followed by a baggage screen prior to getting into the hotel. Not sure if that was to do with the Military Sports conference or a thing from when terrorists bomb the Marriott.
Up after a few hours sleep and a nice welcome to traditional Sri Lankan buffett breakfast. 
The hotel itself was pretty good, I didn't have any issues. Any poolside service was pretty quick. Need to learn how to make a good pizza, the only letdown. It is close to  the Centre of town, the beach and the main temples that are there. I would definately stay here again if I was return.",Solo

All the staff were kind and efficient but our butler Rushan was by far the best of them all. He made sure all our needs were met and went out of his way to ensure we had the best possible stay, asking the chef to prepare foods not on the menu that we wanted and even brought chilli's from his own garden for us to try.

Situated on a stunning beach that offered a unique sense of being in the middle of sea, Jetwing Saman Villas delivered both the privacy we sought and exceptional luxury from arrival to departure. While the accommodation and food were outstanding, the highlight was the exceptional hospitality. Special recognition goes to Kavindu, Thilani, and Sashika for their attentive care, though the entire staff was remarkably kind and considerate. 

We stayed in a deluxe suite with a pool which was so much fun. Each room has a designated butler whom you can call if you need anything but we didn’t not have to use this service since everything you need was there already. The minibar was free for use for the first instance and had a reasonable range of local alcohol and fizzy drinks. The bed was very comfortable and the room had automated blinds that ensures a good sleep.

The food was delightful as well. They were made with a twist of Sri Lankan flavor and apparently most of the items are locally sourced . Hats off to chefs for creating such amazing dishes. We wanted to taste a bit of everything and the staff was so kind to accommodate.

The framed photograph and sweet box presented at check-out were a lovely and memorable gesture. Thank you, Saman Villas team, for your wonderful hospitality.",Couples

But this time absolutely incredible, the food was a complete game changer. beautifully presented, full of flavor, and clearly prepared with care and creativity. Every dish we had was delicious, from starters to dessert. It felt like the culinary experience had been completely elevated since our last visit, and we were so pleasantly surprised.

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,4,Lovely Stay with a Few Suggestions for Improvement,"This was my third visit to the hotel, and overall, it was a great experience once again. The hotel is superb — from the food to the staff and all other facilities, everything was well-maintained and worth the price. I would definitely return and recommend it to others.

A few suggestions that could make the stay even better:

Checkout Time Flexibility: The staff was quite firm on the 12 noon checkout, and I felt rushed. It would be great if there was some flexibility. One more small note: the lunch buffet starts at 12:30 PM, but checkout is at 12noon , so we were left with half an hour of waiting around without much to do. Maybe this timing could be reconsidered to improve the guest experience.

Bar Location: The bar is a bit far from the pool area. Having it closer by the side of the pool would be more convenient — nothing like enjoying a cocktail while relaxing by the pool.

Friday Night Music: The DJ music on Friday night was extremely loud. I couldn’t even hear my husband speaking next to me. Since most guests come to relax, soft restaurant background music would create a much more pleasant atmosphere. We all come to enjoy dinner with the great sea breeze. Not to listen to very loud music.

Saturday Water Aerobics: While some may enjoy it, the session felt unnecessary and a bit disruptive, especially as the pool is small. A calm poolside environment would be more in line with a relaxing weekend getaway.Its disturbing to others who are not participating. 

Toilet Cleanliness: The lobby toilet smelled nice and seemed clean overall, but the toilet seat was quite dirty, which was disappointing. Also, the small plant pot inside the toilet area looked unattractive and neglected.

That said, the 4th-floor rooms offer a lovely view, and if a few of the above points are addressed, this place has all the potential to be an exceptional getaway spot. Looking forward to my 4th visit soon!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,4,Spent a nice day at Citrus Hikkaduwa,"Delicious food was served, and there were a few live stations.  The aqua aerobics class was enjoyable.

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,5,"Citrus Hikkaduwa offers a beautiful beachfront location, clean and comfortable rooms, great food, and excellent amenitie","Our stay at Citrus Hikkaduwa was truly memorable and exceeded our expectations. The location is perfect—right by the beach with stunning views of the ocean and easy access to local shops and attractions. The rooms were clean, spacious, and well-maintained, with all the modern amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The hotel also offers a beautiful pool area and a wide variety of food options that cater to different tastes.

What made our experience truly special, however, was the exceptional service provided by Mr. Nandana. From the moment we arrived, he went above and beyond to ensure we were well taken care of. His attention to detail, friendly nature, and professionalism truly stood out. Whether it was assisting with special requests, recommending local activities, or simply checking in to make sure we were comfortable, Mr. Nandana’s hospitality made us feel genuinely welcome and valued.

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,1,Please believe the reviews about this Hotel! Do NOT Stay.,"First problem: No real information on the differences between Deluxe & Superior rooms on the website. 
We booked a hotel with a lift, thinking it would go to all rooms, NO, it only goes to DELUXE rooms.
Our room was up two flights of stairs (not suitable for either myself or my Wife) the response from the staff when we raised this was that ‘it’s not their website’ but nowhere stated the superior rooms were not accessible. 
That was when the nightmare really started, this was by far and away the worst Hotel room I have been allocated in 40+ years of travelling the world. If this is their idea of superior I hate to think superior to what? 
The decoration was dated and needed a good update, however the Mini Fridge had mould and dirt across the front and inside, (see photos) the floors were dirty, the inside of the bathroom door was also covered in something and mould, rainfall shower head looked like it had never been cleaned in the 15+ years since it was put in, black mould all over the shower and bathroom. 
Unsurprisingly, I went back to reception to complain and the Duty manager came out and agreed that the room was not of the standard that they would want to supply, he couldn’t move us to a Deluxe room but “May be able to tomorrow” at an additional charge of £20 per night for the remaining 12 nights of our Holiday.
We were shown a different room which was down one flight of stairs, so still not accessible. The facilities were the same as the previous room, they were marginally cleaner but the shower was filthy and mouldy. So much so that even after 20 hours travelling I wasn’t prepared to have a shower in the room. The sheets also had dirty marks on them (we didn’t notice until later as it was late at night and we’d been travelling nearly 24 hours at this point). We agreed to stay in the room for that night on the understanding that we would be leaving the next day unless they could come up with a suitable room. 
The “all-inclusive” restaurant is actually a “some inclusive”, Coke is, but Coke Zero isn’t, different meals are and aren’t, and the quality is poor. Breakfast was no better.
When we were at Breakfast we saw the Duty Manager but he didn’t come to talk to us. After Breakfast we decided that we needed to find a different hotel, so we went on a tour of the other hotels in the area and found somewhere better to stay.
When we checked out, the Duty Manager finally offered us an upgrade to a Deluxe room and showed me around 3 rooms which although they were better and cleaner- hard not to be- they still had black mould in the showers. Their surprise that we still wanted to leave, after their disinterest and poor customer service meant for me it was just too little too late. We checked out and because we hadn’t accepted the offered ‘upgrade’ we received no refund. 
This is the first bad review I have ever written about a trip ever, normally if things aren't quite what I was hoping for, I can accept different standards for different people.",Couples

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,5,The Staff are absolutely amazing!!,"We have had two weeks in this lovely hotel.   It is Low Season, and there were plenty of staff available at all times as it wasn’t overly busy.

The whole place was exceptionally clean.  The room cleaner was a master of towel creations and he really made us giggle.

We had a super friendly and attentive restaurant waiter/barman called Sanjeewa who was lovely and we very much enjoyed his company, but quite honestly EVERYONE single member of the staff there bent over backwards to help us and to chat with us.

Yes - there was a lot of curry on the menu…. It is only to be expected.
We wanted burger and chips once or twice - which was available on the room service menu.   It was delicious.   We don’t eat Fish ourselves but the food that a group ordered from the A La Carte menu went out and I was really impressed with it!!  The staff were so chuffed with how it looked too - there was almost a parade as servers and chefs presented it proudly to the guests .,. It was lovely to see.

We both had a brilliant time!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,4,"Great Staff, lovely people and a great location!","Amazing Staff… they are a credit to you! The staff made our 2 week, all inclusive stay. Nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with a smile and a chat. Comfortable rooms, good authentic Sri Lankan food and a great atmosphere. The rooms are basic, but clean and comfy. The hotel is situated very close to shops, bars and restaurants and makes a great base for exploring. We made our way around by hailing a ‘tuc tuc’ great fun, but a bit dubious at times. We went on the safari and our guide was amazing, seeing the elephants in the wild was beautiful, this was followed by a visit to the elephant orphanage which was lovely. Overall a great place to stay",Couples

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,1,Absolutely the Worst Hotel Experience I’ve Had – DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"I stayed at Citrus Hikkaduwa on May 3rd, 2025, and it was hands down the most disappointing hotel experience I’ve ever had — both in Sri Lanka and abroad.

I made my booking through Agoda (Booking ID: 1605562865) for a Deluxe Room with Full Board (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The confirmation email I received from Agoda clearly stated that all three meals were included. I even have screenshots from Agoda showing the pricing breakdown:

LKR 18,123 – Bed & Breakfast

LKR 22,182 – Bed & Breakfast

LKR 23,417 – Dinner & Breakfast

LKR 26,095 – Full Board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

I obviously selected the Full Board option and paid accordingly. But when I arrived at the hotel at around 1:45 PM, I was told by the reception that meals weren’t included. I showed them the official confirmation from Agoda, and unbelievably, they responded by saying, “Those are the benefits you can get if you pay extra.”

Absolutely ridiculous.

After keeping me waiting until 2:30 PM just to check in, they refused to offer what I paid for and told me to contact Agoda myself — completely washing their hands off the issue. If you’re listed on Agoda, you should know how to handle booking issues with your partner. That’s basic hospitality. Instead, the reception staff showed no professionalism, no empathy, and no problem-solving ability whatsoever. They were also rude and dismissive, showing zero understanding of what customer service means.

Later I had to follow up with Agoda, and both Agoda and Citrus started bouncing the blame back and forth. Citrus claimed they received the booking via Expedia, not Agoda, which I as the end customer, do not care about. I booked through Agoda. I received a full board confirmation through Agoda. That’s the end of the story for me. Their Reservations Manager, Upendra, sent excuse after excuse, repeatedly saying “we didn’t get the booking from Agoda”. Then who took my money? Who sent me the confirmation? Why are you even listed on Agoda if you can’t handle a booking through it?

It’s funny (and tragic) how this hotel boasts about being a top brand in Sri Lanka with the following mission and vision on their website:

Vision: “To be the ultimate hospitality brand in Sri Lanka.”
Mission: “To deliver exceptional hospitality by going beyond the call of duty and extending personalized, friendly and professional service at every given opportunity.”

These statements are laughable considering the treatment I received.

The only saving grace during my stay was the restaurant staff at SALT, who were genuinely kind, respectful, and professional — unlike the rest of the hotel staff who clearly need hospitality training from scratch.

To the hotel’s Director of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Mani Sugathapala, perhaps you could use this review as a negative marketing case study. You can reach out to me if you’d like a detailed breakdown of how your brand failed at every possible touchpoint.

This hotel doesn’t deserve even 3 stars, let alone the inflated ratings it shows online. I had higher expectations when I booked, and now I just feel cheated and disappointed. You ruined my vacation.

I’ll be sharing this review on Agoda, Google, TripAdvisor, and social media platforms to help others avoid this nightmare.",Couples

Avudangawa,Aliya Resort & Spa,5,Lori Adventure,"My partner and i were staying for 2 nights in the Aliya Resort & Spa. Combining top-notch service, an amazing view over sigiriya, beautiful and luxurious rooms and excellent food, this hotel is one of the finest destinations you can head to in sri lanka. 
As an animal lover, you have so much to discover in this beautiful facility. In addition to peacocks, geckos, monkeys, cows, bats, chipmunks, monitor lizards, and much more, one animal in particular managed to impress us. During a four hour night safari, we were able to spot very rare and shy loris.
Our guide Akash and his colleague made it possible for us, to see not only one, but in total 9 of these fascinating creatures. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.",Couples
Avudangawa,Aliya Resort & Spa,5,An exceptional three nights at Aliya Resort & Spa,"I stayed at the Aliya Resort and Spa with a small group of Australian guests.  We were a group of 11.  Aliya Resort is a sprawling estate that provides all of your needs and wants without being intrusive.  The property has a large capacity, but you never feel overcrowded or neglected by staff.   The food is amazing - fresh and plenty of selection. Staff attentiveness is second to none - from housekeeping, spa, pool service, reception and of course the incredible waitstaff and bar staff.  I would love to name every single staff member but.  There are two standouts, which I know had their team members supporting them as well.  Supun, one of the head waiters was fun, friendly, professional and attentive.  His humour was well received by our group - along with his team in the bar.  Isuru was also a stand out.  His personal service to our small group at one of our dinners was exceptional.  He was polite, friendly and informative.  He also was supported by other staff, but the group loved him as well.  Thank you to all staff that looked after us.  Would return here to the resort in a flash.",Friends

Colombo,Cinnamon Life City of Dreams,4,Overall a good property with lots of potential.,"We as the ex retired Flag Officer’s, checked in to Cinnamon Life City of Dreams on 27 June 2025 to celebrate our comradeship…

The introduction to the property was given by your staff (our comrade Rajendra Wattowita). This introduction & the package made us to select your property for our event.

Though this is a new property…
From the inception, it gave a different perspective.
The hotel security staff guided us correctly to our parking spots in an orderly manner & guided us correctly to the vast property.
Front Office: 
Staff were courtier and did the checking in /out fast. Guided us to our rooms. Good job.
House Keeping:
Staff were professional and attended to all our requirements. Good professional work.
F & B:
Staff was good & the spread was large,  but the taste of the food has to be improved… 
In the morning breakfast certain items in continental / English breakfast were not available in the spread. When inquired the answer given was not suited for a five star property (but later on the requested item was provided). Good attempt…
Hence professional cookery aspect has to be enhanced to suit the client’s tastes.

The buffet was excellent, with a wide variety of tasty dishes. We especially enjoyed the Sri Lankan traditional sweets – compliments to the chefs!

We also tried in-room dining, and it was an outstanding experience. The person who answered the call was very professional, and the food was delivered promptly. The staff who brought the food was knowledgeable and polite.

Colombo,Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo,3,Misinformation from Long Feng manager Mr.Deen,"Extremely disappointed with the experience we had with the Manager at Long Feng, Mr.Deen and feel the need to bring this to the attention of both the hotel and other guests.
When we called to make the reservation, we clearly asked Mr. Deen (the manager at Long Feng) several times whether our vouchers and promotions would be valid for the “All You Can Eat Dim Sum.” He confirmed multiple times over the phone that they were valid. Based on his confirmation we proceeded to make our reservation and visit the restaurant.
However, after our meal, we were informed that the vouchers were in fact not applicable. This directly contradicts everything Mr. Deen told us earlier. This is not just a simple mistake — it’s a complete failure in communication and accountability on the part of someone who is supposed to be in a position of responsibility. If he wasn’t 100% sure, the bare minimum he should have done was to double-check before giving us a definite answer. Instead, he gave us false information with complete confidence, which led to an embarrassing and frustrating situation for us as customers.
Frankly, it’s unacceptable for a manager at a five-star hotel to behave in such an incompetent and careless manner. Guests rely on your managers to provide correct details about promotions etc. 
I sincerely hope you take this seriously and ensure that issues like this are addressed — both in terms of accountability for Mr. Deen’s actions, and making sure such miscommunication doesn’t happen to other guests. This kind of service is simply not acceptable from a hotel of your reputation.",Family

Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,4,Food was good lack of pool comfy room,The food options were good. The room was comfortable. The bathroom was on the smaller side. There was no pool but there was a bar on roof. We had fun there as it was near to beach with food trucks. We walked to the nearby fort. I recommend visiting as it was good,Family
Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,5,Fantastic,"Spent three nights at Jetwing Jaffna on a trip to the peninsula. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but, never had been to Jaffna and I wanted to visit. Jetwing is a great base around which to plan a trip to Jaffna. It is new, rooms are fantastic, staff is very friendly and helpful. Restaurant and the food is exceptional. If you go there, try to get the Jaffna Seafood buffet. Unbelievable! Very convenient to drive or take a rental car to rest of Jaffna from the hotel. Also very walkable to the main city attractions including the bustling market.  Fantastic value for money.  If I go back to Jaffna, I’ll definitely stay at Jetwing again.",Friends
Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,3,"Absolutely OK, but a bit average","The location is great, the rooms are comfortable, clean and tasteful. There's a lovely view from the balcony over the Library and Town Hall towards the sea. Breakfast was decent. But this isn't one of Jetwing's special hotels, in terms of ambience or service. It is a functional and perfectly alright city hotel, but no real charm or character. The service was mostly pretty average (at best), with only a few exceptions  - a shoutout for the young man on reception who directed me to St. James' Church, Nallur for a funeral, who was super helpful and proactive. We had no hot water on the first night in any of the three rooms we occupied. Nothing was done about this, despite repeated requests. Various fixtures and fittings in the room were broken, and it was really difficult to get these fixed. Many of the staff didn't speak English (including some of those on reception!), so dodged any interaction with foreign guests (we were a mixed SL/international group), and avoided responding to requests or questions. There's a rooftop with potentially great views, but no effort to create a tasteful space or to make the most of it. Jetwing ... you're a good hotel chain, with an enviable record elsewhere ... but I think you need to up your game on this hotel. It could be so much better.",Friends
Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,3,Very Average! We won’t be back.,"Very average for a Jetwing. The dinner buffet was atrocious. Very limited items with no vegetable curries. Breakfast and lunch were actually good. The staff didn’t make us feel welcome. No smiles. 

We also stayed at Mahesha Bhavan, which was delightful and friendly. It’s quite the opposite.",Family

Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,5,Outstanding customer service in a personal crisis!,"We stayed here for 3 nights. We loved this hotel, it was full of character, the rooms were lovely, the  and the quality of the food provided in the restaurant was outstanding. But the big issue for us occurred when I was taken ill in the night. The night manager arranged transport to hospital. Later the general manager, Nilanthi, arrived at the hospital and did everything she could to make me comfortable, to support my husband and to smooth the process for me. What was a scary experience became much more tolerable thanks to her and her staff. I can't praise this hotel enough, I would give 10 points out of 5 if I could! Thanks Jetwing Jaffna!",Couples
Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,1,Disappointing Experience at Jetwing Jaffna,"We recently stayed at Jetwing Jaffna and were quite disappointed with the service provided. Given the high price, the experience did not meet our expectations.

Firstly..we did not receive the welcome drink that was supposed to be offered. Additionally, there was no assistance with luggage management, making our check-out quite inconvenient.

A major issue arose with our takeaway breakfast. Since we were exploring Jaffna, we had specifically ordered two pure vegetarian and two non veg breakfasts. However the vegetarian packs contained eggs and cake, which was unacceptable as we are strictly vegetarian. This left us starving and highly disappointed. Even on other days, the buffet spread was very limited.

Having stayed at four different resorts within the same hotel chain, this was by far the worst experience. We hope the management takes these concerns seriously and improves the service for future guests.",Family

But I just wanted to address few things one is the room is old and I think the cost of the room abit more costly for the value which paid, the floor are not clean and having mosquitoes issue at night.
For the breakfast, I don’t find many choice compare to they buffet at night, I don’t think so breakfast are free which already into the room bill, this Abit not fair and not worth at all",Solo

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,5,A True Five-Star Gem in the Heart of Colombo,"I travel frequently and place great importance on the quality of the hotels I stay in. Without a doubt, Shangri-La Colombo is the best five-star hotel I’ve ever booked. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, and although the hotel itself is large, you never feel overwhelmed or crowded. The atmosphere is open and serene, and the staff delivers truly personalized and attentive service.

A special mention goes to Ms. Senali Ratnadasa, Assistant Guest Manager, whose kindness and sense of hospitality made our stay even more memorable. Encounters like these give this hotel a unique charm—far from the impersonal feel of many large hotels.

The hotel also features a high-end, fully equipped spa, offering a wide range of treatments in a serene setting that allows you to feel completely relaxed and rejuvenated.

I will definitely return and highly recommend Shangri-La Colombo to anyone seeking a true five-star experience while visiting the city.
See you again soon!",Family

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,1,"Complaint Regarding Banquet Function on March 29, 2025- Incident involving banquet kitchen staff member piyumi","Complaint Regarding Banquet Function on March 29, 2025

Dear Shangri-La Colombo Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction regarding an incident that occurred during a banquet function on March 29, 2025, involving your kitchen staff member, Piyumi.

During the event, I observed that Ms. Piyumi was unprofessional in her interactions with guests. Specifically, there was a moment when she appeared to argue with a guest rather than assisting them with their needs. Furthermore, I witnessed her engaging in behavior that was not in line with the hospitality standards expected at Shangri-La. 

Additionally, I noticed that she appeared to be consuming a drink while on duty, which is concerning for a staff member working at a guest-facing event. This behavior not only reflects poorly on the standards of your establishment but also potentially affects the experience of your guests.

I believe that proper training and adherence to professional conduct are crucial for maintaining the high standards that Shangri-La is known for. I hope that this feedback will be taken seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that all staff members uphold the values of hospitality that your hotel represents.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.",Business

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,2,Sapphire Lounge,"This place used to be one of the friendliest spots in Colombo, with excellent staff and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Since 2021, it has been our go-to location for business catchups and my mum’s favourite lounge whenever we are in Sri Lanka.

However, my last two visits, in January and June of last year were quite disappointing. The service was noticeably slower, and the staff no longer carried the same friendly, attentive attitude that once set this place apart. What was even more disheartening was the sense that service now seems divided  with locals often receiving less favourable treatment.

Hospitality and service excellence should not be based on appearance or assumptions about where someone comes from. Every guest, whether local or foreign, deserves to feel equally welcomed and valued. After all, locals also contribute significantly to the success of a business.

Although I am not a local myself, I still felt that the spirit of excellence this place was once known for has sadly faded. I truly hope to see the standard of service return to what it used to be  inclusive, warm, and exceptional.",Family

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,5,Feels like 7 star,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, internationally. In fact, I wished I had a lifetime free allowance to stay here!

Impeccable. Infallible. Flawless. 

A Wow grand entrance hall. Massive. Wonderful introduction by reception staff. 
They will go that one step more to surprise and please you e.g. anniversary, birthdays etc. Balloons and cakes etc. I was certainly taken aback as I entered my room. 

Breakfast is well worth the price. You will be spoilt for choice. What a variety of food! 

Concierge - especially Janaka, are the best to make the most of your trip in Sri Lanka. 

Hotel are very flexible with regards to late check out, as ALL hotels should be.  NOTE, all hotels of the world!. I say this because not all airlines can land at a time conducive to hotel times. 

A great mall linked to the hotel is very handy when it comes to shopping, dining, souvenirs etc.

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,4,Top quality hotel with great room view and breakfast,"We stayed in a deluxe twin room, 2 twin beds with a lake view. The room was just spacious enough for 2 people. It had all the amenities we required but you could hear music from the ground floor (as our room was situated on the lower floors). Nice view from my room of the lake and the hotels nearby. 

The staff were friendly enough and helped us when we need them. Conveniently, the hotel is connected to the mall, so it’s another way to enter the hotel. Understandably security is a constant aspect of the hotel but once you get to know the people, its painless. 

The breakfast was fantastic at his hotel with lots of options. The seating was no issue, so we never had to worry about getting a seat. Whilst we were there, many events took place at the hotel (wedding & bank events) so it can get a bit busy.

I had issues getting an uber from the hotel as the hotel has 2 entrances (I believe). The staff tried to help but it came to no avail. I think the security can scare of some of the scooter drivers, so you are best of walking to the front of the mall to get them.

The main tourist sites are not really close by, but I would say that the hotel is situated in the middle, with the sites north and south of it.",Family

The staff is very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was very good. We only stayed one night and regret not having booked more nights.",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,A wonderful stay in mirissa,"We absolutely loved our time here. The rooms are spacious and the bed is comfy. Breakfast is really lovely, selection of fruit, fresh juice, toast, jam and your choice of eggs. We loved watching the monkeys from our balcony in the trees. The guest house is close to all amenities and tourist attractions including coconut tree hill and swimming with turtles.  The hosts were lovely! Anything asked was never an issue. Thank you so much both for a wonderful stay. If we come back to mirissa, we will sure to stay with you again! Steph and alex",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,Loved this place!,"Quiet, lovely spot tucked off the main road, with a beautiful, lush garden and pretty pool. Feels like a little oasis. Beautiful rooms decorated in the Sri Lankan style, with pretty artefacts and four poster beds. Great service and absolutely delicious breakfast included.",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",3,Not as expected,"We cannot fault the owners who were helpful with advice on activities and where to eat, and were clearly supporting the local community. The main villa also looks lovely. However, we wanted to flag a few pointers (especially with solo travellers in mind) for future guests. 

We were put in the second villa - not the main spice house. To reach this you either need to walk through a boggy jungle for five minutes or through a side alley filled with guard dogs and strays. This is fine in the day, but pitch black at night and pretty frightening. 

One evening at around 10pm we walked home through the side alley (the recommended path from the owners) to be met by four snarling dogs. We felt threatened and turned back to the main street to try the second entrance to the property. There was then someone available to guide us home with a torch through the jungle route. On our next evening we arrived back later and walked through the jungle alone with phone torches as no one was at the property to guide us. It’s not what you want when simply trying to get home, and we’d worry for someone doing this alone. 

We both have dogs and are comfortable around strays, but even one of the workers when we flagged this story the next morning admitted that some of these dogs can be aggressive and that he has thrown stones at them before to keep them at bay.. 

During the night we were kept up by very loud dog fights down the alleys where the villa is located. In the morning (from 8am) we were woken by loud construction works on a new property adjacent to where we were staying. 

The reviews are so glowing on here for those staying in the main property, but as guests in the second villa we left feeling a bit disappointed.",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",3,Inaccurate website,"There are some positives: Sri Lankan breakfast was lovely, the waiting staff are kind, and it’s close to Turtle Beach and the infinity pool that comes with the villa rooms. Tuk tuks to take you around the property.

However, no hot water in the shower each morning, and no umbrellas available to walk to breakfast (10 min walk to house from the villa or tuk tuk ride). 

The website must have been written pre-covid and needs updating. There was no chef for food (except breakfast), they do not take credit cards and require cash payment. 

Overall it is probably fair value for money but not for me - I stayed in other Sri Lankan properties in the same 2 weeks who had solar heated water and never woke up to a cold shower.",Family
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,Fabulous Stay & Highly Recommend,"Where to start! Phil, his wife and team  are absolutely amazing. We absolutely loved our stay in the rooftop room at the villa which had such an amazing pool looking out towards the jungle.  We woke to the sound of monkeys, peacocks and the bread van daily and loved it ❤️ Nothing is too much trouble and the team were always so friendly and helpful as were Phil and his wife.  Only a 5 minute walk away from the beautiful Mirissa beach, Coconut Hill    and Parrot Rock. We'd highly recommend staying here if you're thinking of visiting Mirissa.  Thank you so much for a fabulous stay ❤️ Ian & Susan xx",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,A cozy home stay with a beautiful garden,"The Spice House is actually a house run by its owner Mrs. Vatsala and her husband. Its located on the main street of Mirissa that runs parallel to the beach. Its placed behind a few properties that face the main road and cannot be viewed directly as one walks by. But once you enter the space, you are transported into a beautiful tropical paradise. It has a beautiful pool in its backyard. There are a few rooms in the main house and a few in the garden. Clean and well maintained. Our host took care of our food preferences well. Enjoyed our stay in The Spice House.",Family

The owners have really done a wonderful job building villas with a couple of swimming pools in a very lush, tropical setting. The owner was English who has married a Sri Lankan lady and he clearly has an eye for design as the room was beautiful with some lovely design features. The room was one of three a short walk away from the main house and the rooms shared a kitchen and beautiful swimming pool that wrapped round a covered lounging area. We spent a lovely time in the pool watching the monkeys feeding on the trees in the extensive garden.",Couples

Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,5,A Delightful Stay in the Heart of Jaffna,"Jetwing Jaffna offers a wonderful experience that blends modern comforts with authentic local charm. From the moment you step in, the welcoming ambiance and attentive staff set the tone for a memorable stay.

The rooms are well-maintained and beautifully designed, with an interior that perfectly combines elegance and comfort. Everything was in great condition, making it a relaxing retreat after a day of exploring. The meals at the hotel are a highlight—infused with the rich and distinct flavors of Jaffna cuisine. Each dish feels like a celebration of local culture, and it’s clear that the culinary team takes great pride in their work.

While the hotel offers an impressive range of amenities, the absence of a swimming pool was slightly disappointing. A pool would enhance the overall experience, especially for guests looking to unwind further.

Overall, Jetwing Jaffna is a fantastic choice for anyone visiting the region. The delicious meals, cozy rooms, and authentic touches make it a destination worth revisiting. It’s an ideal base for exploring Jaffna while enjoying a touch of luxury. Highly recommended for travelers seeking comfort and a taste of local culture.",Business

The rooms were not only clean and equipped with all the essentials, but they also offered a lovely view, which added to the overall experience.  

Breakfast provided a good selection of dishes with slight changes every other day, keeping it fresh and enjoyable. We also had dinner on the rooftop one evening, and while the rain disrupted the ambiance a bit, the food was excellent.  

The staff deserves a special mention for being incredibly accommodating and attentive, always ready to assist with any requests. The hotel's central location was another highlight, making it easy for us to explore nearby attractions, dining options, and shopping spots.  

Overall, it was a memorable and enjoyable stay. We would highly recommend this hotel for its great service, beautiful views, convenience, and comfort.",Family
Jaffna,Jetwing Jaffna,3,Give the same facilities given to the other Jetwing hotels to this hotel also.,I expected more than this from your hotel as it's managed by a reputed company. We were really disappointed to see that this hotel didn't have a pool. It would be much better to give the same facilities that given to the other Jetwing hotels. It would  have been much better to have two harm chairs in the room and a small garden area to relax in. But I really appreciate the hospitality given by your staff & the tasty food served.,Family
Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,5,"Lovely hotel, 5 Star staff 😊","I was unsure about this hotel after reading some of the reviews, but I have to say it was unfounded. We stayed in a deluxe sea view room on the 3rd floor. From the minute of our arrival we felt very welcome. We were greeted with a refreshing drink and didn’t have long to wait for our rooms. The hotel is in a beautiful setting on the beach and with plenty of bars and restaurants outside on the road in both directions.
We stayed on an all inclusive basis and found the food very good with plenty of choice. We did eat out nearby also on occasion.
Yes the hotel could do with a little updating in particular the rooms and pool. However there were works being carried out whilst we were there and I believe they were closing in April to carry out more. Saying this however everywhere was miticulously clean. Only issue we found with our room was storage. There was a lovely wardrobe area, but the room could do with some drawers. There wasn’t many coat hangars but we just asked our room boy and he got us more.
The staff at this hotel really make it. Every one of them with a smile on their face and very helpful. They make it 5 stars! Three of the staff in particular made our holiday. Nuwan who within minutes of our arrival spoke to management in order for me to have coke zero (I am diabetic) included in our all inclusive (as it isn’t normally) which was above and beyond. He also looked after us on many occasions in the restaurant. Also Chinthaka and Sanjeewa who again looked after us, always having a table ready for us every meal time. All were a pleasure and we had some great chats with them. They are a credit to the hotel. Our room boy (can’t remember his name) left our room clean and with great towel art every day, thank you.
Also a special mention to management, who on Independence Day made us feel so included in your celebrations. We really enjoyed it, especially the tea 😊. A big thank you to you all and your staff.
Would I stay again? Without a doubt.

Always smiling, polite and helpful. During the rain I went to the store for fruit, but it was raining heavily. There were no hotel umbrellas, but Malsha was nearby. She lent me her private umbrella.

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,5,Exceptional Hospitality and Honesty – A Remarkable Experience for Our Japanese Business Partners,"On the 31st of January, Mr. Saman Jayasooriya and his foreign business partners from Japan visited this hotel, and they were truly impressed by the outstanding service they received. From the moment they arrived, the hospitality was exceptional—starting with the front office, where the staff provided a warm welcome. The food was excellent, the service was seamless, and the entire team carried out their duties with professionalism and dedication.

A particular incident during the visit highlighted the honesty and integrity of the hotel staff. One of our Japanese business partners had unknowingly left behind a valuable laptop. The hotel staff promptly contacted them, ensuring its safe return. This act of honesty deeply impressed our foreign guests, as they were amazed by the sincerity and ethical values upheld by the Sri Lankan staff.

Mr. Saman Jayasooriya and his team expressed their gratitude, especially towards the front office manager, Mr. Sampath, who played a key role in providing exceptional service. Our Japanese partners repeatedly mentioned how this experience strengthened their admiration for Sri Lankan hospitality and professionalism.

Given the remarkable service and integrity displayed, I would confidently give this hotel a 100% rating. It is a place that not only offers comfort and excellent service but also upholds the highest standards of honesty, leaving a lasting impression on international visitors.",Business
Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,2,A disappointment,"I immediately regretted my decision to book this hotel for my family and me as soon as we entered our room. The room quality was poor far below my expectations for a reputed hotel. Having stayed at Hikka Tranz several times, I had hoped that Citrus would at least be a decent alternative. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

The room we received was extremely basic and lacked essential amenities, except for shampoo and body wash in the bathroom. To make matters worse, the toilet wall had visible fungus, which was both shocking and disgusting for a hotel of this reputation. Even the swimming pool was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We genuinely felt that the experience was not worth the money we paid.

In the morning, as we stepped out of our room, we were greeted by a plate of leftover food on the floor. Additionally, a broken bed and mattress were left in the hallway. Even the framed pictures on the walls had mold growing inside them. It was disheartening to see that no effort had been made to maintain or improve the hotel's quality. When we inquired about this, the staff mentioned that renovations were planned for April, but this still did not justify the current condition of the hotel.

The only redeeming factor of our stay was the staff they were wonderful! They ensured that we had a pleasant experience wherever possible, and even at the restaurant, they served us with warm smiles.

I sincerely hope that the hotel management takes immediate action to refurbish the hotel and improve its standards. Otherwise, guests will soon realize that the pictures shared online do not reflect the reality on the ground.",Family

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,1,Avoid the Restaurant,"I stayed here for 2 nights as part of a group of 10 on trip to Sri Lanka. We used the hotel restaurant on the first night. We placed the food order at 19:05. More than 1 hour later my meal still hadn't arrived. The others had finished their meal by that time. We kept pushing for my order and that may have caused additional problems as I was ill during the night and following day as a result of the meal. The meal was a fish dish (see photo) that was supposed to come with yellow rice and a salad. Nothing but the fish arrived. Supposed to be spicy. It wasn't. The fish's face summed up the meal. As others in the group said. As I was in group, I should have been advised when I ordered how long it was going to be. Didn't dare ask for a refund after seeing previous reviews on here.",Friends

We stayed at the upstairs room which I think is the better choice compared to the more costly room with a pool in the downstairs.
The staff really took this place to the next level, offering the best care, and going out of their way to make the experience more memorable 

The food too , was excellent. Enjoying the meals while enjoying the calming waves of the sea, was so enjoyable. Also the complimentary brief  foot massage they provided was a nice touch.

Our Butler, Niroshan, was amazing and was always there to greet us when we went for breakfast and dinner. He even set up our floating breakfast in the pool which was beautiful!

The villa was really spacious and had all the amenities you could want for your stay. We stayed in a few different locations in Sri Lanka and Jetwing was the only place where the air conditioning actually kept the room sufficiently cool in the heat and humidity!

There is access to both beaches either side with security making us feel extra safe. The beaches were both amazing and very quiet, often only another couple or 2 to share them with.

On cons; stayed in a triple bed room, however the spare bed was very uncomfortable. I have been in many stars hotels and the spare bed were always top notch, quite disappointed considering hertiance.

There are two large pools, and the view from the main pool is simply amazing.
The resort boasts a huge, clean beachfront, though the sea is quite rough, so swimming isn’t really possible.

We tried both the dinner and lunch buffets, which offered a nice spread of local and international dishes. However, the lighting in the restaurant could be improved — it feels a bit dark and uninviting.
That said, the staff were consistently friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

Rooms are nice, comfortable, and well-maintained.",Family

My husband had a spa massage which he reported to be fantastic (he’s quite the connoisseur), and we both enjoyed the “mini spa” (hot tub, steam room and sauna) which you can book for private use.

Hosts can also organise tuktuk to Weligama and good at recommendations for surf school etc.  They can also organise whale watching although we got a much cheaper deal from guy on the beach and it was great, but we were not peak season.

Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",3,"""Dissapointed...""","When reading reviews and believing this particular place was more than what it actually is, it was, for us ,a very disappointing experience..
So much so, we decided we would seek alternative accommodation to stay at after our 1st night...
A warm greeting did await our arrival... but from that point, things went downhill on our experience...
The Owners wife explained that no dinner would be available because their chef was attending a wedding, which is great for him, but what do we do for food?
So we had to get our driver to hunt out a restaurant in the area so we could eat..
So if you book any establishment and it says food is available, then if your chef has family commitments, you still have an obligation to your guests/ clients in relation to a booking made with you..
It's your responsibility to ensure what is described on booking materials is actually available..
The room was small and too dark for our taste..
When we left the room too go out, we left fan/ aircon on to keep room cool..
When we returned it had been switched off..
Now if I pay for something, I expect to use it for the time I've paid for..
Never experienced this happening anywhere in the world during our many travels..
No hot water available for using sink in the bathroom..strange , but true..
Many mosquitoes ( which I totally understand with the nature of the country), but in all other hotels we've used in Sri Lanka, they have repellent in rooms..
Either electronic or sticks...
Sheets aren't changed daily..
So if you're sweatting and having to keep using sheets, that's not good in my opinion..
One other point, the owner wanted cash in regards settling bill..
No cards accepted at all..
Or you can send money to their UK or EUROPEAN  bank accounts..( very strange in my opinion..)
I certainly wouldn't transfer any money from my account while abroad..
If you like overlooking just houses and small forest type  area, then you'll be fine..
pool is OK but not as big as pictures for advertising seem to suggest..
Camera angles in adverts and paraphernalia always look goid dint they in many a hotel..
No good for us. I'm afraid.. 
As I titled review..dissapointing experience..
You watch the odd review written to put this down the line..",Couples
Mirissa,"The Spice House, Mirissa",5,Beautiful Hotel with Wonderful Hosts,"My husband and I stayed at The Spice House for 3 weeks over the Christmas and New Year period and we loved every minute. Phil and Wathsala were perfect hosts. They helped plan trips, arranged tuk tuk and taxi's, currency exchange and they had an extensive library if you wanted something to read. We stayed in the Clove Cabin which is just outside the main house. The room was perfect for our needs and having a fridge to keep everything cold was ideal. The cabin had a lovely size balcony and in the afternoon you can sit and watch the monkeys, palm squirrels and the beautiful coloured birds. The grounds are beautiful, lucious and really well kept. The pool area's in both the main area and in the Spice Villa are peaceful and so relaxing. They have a lovely team, always willing to help and always smiling. If you need a tuk tuk driver, ask for Jaya. He was a brilliant tourist guide, pointing out attractions and suggesting places to visit. 
I would definitely stay here again.

Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,4,"If you don't want a guest house, this hotel is worth considering","By European standards, it is 3 stars. Stayed in it for 8 days, the hotel has both pros and cons.
Not a bad hotel for Sri Lanka. But you have to remember that this is not Turkey or other resorts. It has its own atmosphere, and the hotel is written out in it

Location: Located in a good location, near a large supermarket, a lot of good cafes and vendors with souvenirs.

Beach: For swimming is not suitable, immediately goes coral reef. That would swim need to walk five minutes to other beaches. Near the beach with turtles, but I would not recommend swimming there. A lot of people, parked boats, and next to the river-stock of waters. The bay is quiet though.

Hotel: the hotel is taken care of, but on local. In places gray, but from the humidity can not go anywhere. In the room did not work one bulb, the door to the balcony was like after the war. But the rooms are spacious, air conditioning works properly. Nothing was stolen.Also I will note as a plus, at us poisoned mosquitoes on the territory. For all time we saw only two of them. Dengue can not be afraid. On the wildlife, the hotel is large, so scarce. Lizards, ants, and crows. On the tree sometimes there were chipmunks.

Staff: The staff is not annoying, on tips do not ask for tips, quickly fall behind. But the local callers often spin not far from the hotel, and every day fool the head.

Food: usual for Sri Lanka. There are both local spicy dishes and not spicy cuisine. There was enough fruit. Although, only breakfast is enough, there are a lot of cafes nearby.

Services: there is a restaurant where the food is quite good, the prices are slightly above average in Sri. There is also a massage. On the territory of sunbeds for sunbathing, towels are issued, but you can not take them to the beach. Ryadam cool diving services. Guys are professionals.",Couples
Hikkaduwa,Citrus Hikkaduwa,4,Very warm welcome,"This was our second time at the citrus this time stayed 13 nights. The staff are very friendly and made you very welcome. The breakfast was good.

Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,4,A few tweaks needed,"The location of the Shangri La is a real plus. The rooms are well designed with everything you expect. We had access to the Horizon Club Lounge, which was also good for high tea and pre dinner drinks. 

The downside to this hotel came at the pool. We arrived at the pool after breakfast at 9.30 am and managed to secure some of the last sunbeds, with many reserved but no one using them. The 2 beds next to use were reserved for more than 5 hours before guests came to use them, this should not be tolerated by the pool team as the pool area is comparatively small to the hotels capacity reserving of sunbeds should not be allowed. 
Breakfast was also quite overwhelming and not a relaxing experience at all. 
Some small tweaks and this hotel would be fabulous.",Couples
Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,5,"Excellent Stay, highly recommend the breakfast","Breakfast here is the best.  Don't book without it. The service and hospitality here was just first class.  I've been to many hotels and this one is one of the best.  Great location to port city and Galle face and mall.

Bilal at the central restaurant (main restaurant) was fantastic.  Never met  such a genuine, caring and service oriented individual.",Family
Colombo,Shangri-La Colombo,3,Shangri-la you can do better!,"I am just leaving the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, concluding my stay here. This was my second visit to this hotel. My first visit was in October 2024, and I must say, I was absolutely delighted back then, which is why I recommended it to a few friends who joined me this time.

However, my experience this time was somewhat different. It started right at check-in, which took an unreasonably long time. The staff was very friendly, but we had to wait far too long to get to our rooms, even though we arrived at the hotel after 3 PM.

Another issue was the selection of drinks at the pool bar—it was very limited, and I struggled to find something suitable for myself. Additionally, given the hotel's category and level, I expected better housekeeping services. Specifically, I anticipated a turndown service in the evening, but no one came to check if we needed anything. This was quite surprising to me.

One of the biggest disappointments was the dining experience. We had dinner at the à la carte restaurant, Shang Palace. We ordered a multi-course menu, and while the food itself was delicious, the service and presentation left much to be desired. Instead of serving individual portions for all five guests, they brought everything in large communal dishes and scooped the food onto our plates. The overall presentation was unappealing and not up to the standards expected from a luxury hotel.

Breakfast was an even bigger disappointment. I remembered Shangri-La for having one of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had. As someone who travels extensively for work—staying/inspecting in over 200 hotels per year—I had high expectations. This time, the experience was very different. I wanted fresh mango juice, which was readily available on my previous visit, but this time, the selection of fresh juices was extremely limited—they only had three options. I ordered an orange juice, but it never arrived. Similarly, I requested a coffee and was given one from a machine more suited to a three-star hotel, rather than a proper espresso from a professional machine. Even after specifically mentioning it, I received the same poor-quality coffee again. Overall, breakfast was a major letdown.

I must say that I am disappointed with the hotel. For my next visit to Colombo, I will have to reconsider whether I return. A renowned hotel chain like Shangri-La should not allow such a decline.",Business

In the middle of so much wonderful nature and animals and yet the rooms felt like a luxury hotel. Tye service was fantastic and so, so friendly. Our personal assistant Sanoj was truly kind and generous and always around when we needed him. All the staff we saw daily, so friendly and lovely. DEFINITELY do the loris walk at night time with the naturist. He was fascinating and showed us so many things (sleeping snake in a tree, fruit bats, fireflies, a porcupine and many other things). Never actually saw a loris but who cares?  It was an amazing adventure.",Family
Sigiriya,"Jetwing Vil Uyana, A Luxury Reserve",5,One of the best hotels I went to in my life.,"The place was like a natural heaven, We stayed only for 1 night, and for only that I felt as if I could live there forever. The food courses didn't have a big selection but to food was so superb, the pool was also large and nice viewed, it was a nice forest and we walk around in the nice roads they have provided. and there is a private view point for the hotel which we could see Sigiriya, We could rent a bike for free and go around the roads of the hotel, the minibar had beer, wine, coca cola, arrack. and they will refill it each night we stay and it was all for free. The room which we booked (Paddy dwelling with pool) contained an outdoor plunge pool, its deeper than it looks like from the photos. The only thing was that the website showed a facility in that room of a Bose Home Entertainment system but it was not there. and our butler Lakshan was very kind and good, and the staff are also very friendly. On the whole, its one of the best hotels I have been to.",Family

Sigiriya,"Jetwing Vil Uyana, A Luxury Reserve",5,A unique and breath-taking experience,"Jetwing Vil Uyana is a unique experience, unrivalled by any other. The eco lodge concept has been executed to near perfection, and whilst the tangible aspects of the venue are breathtaking, it is the service that is truly superior to anywhere that I've experienced. We were taken care of our personal butler, Suranga, aided by his colleague, Sanoj. They went above and beyond to make sure we well taken care of and anticipated all our needs. The food was generous and absolutely delicious. The onsite farm tour was an organic experience in itself, and the Loris bushwalk at nightfall was a cherry on the top of a beautiful stay. The only thing I could say needs improvement was at the Spa. The vibe we got from the staff there was in stark contrast to the warmth and hospitality from everyone else at the eco lodge. All in all, yes, it is pricey compared to many other places in Sri Lanka, however, I would happily spend every cent all over again given the opportunity to do so.",Family

A special thank you to our butler Prasanna, who was incredibly helpful and attentive, making sure our family felt right at home. Also, Sithmini at the reception was very friendly and welcoming — her warm attitude truly made a difference.

From the moment you arrive, you feel really well looked after and it's a really special place to stay. The lovely rooms are dotted around the site so you don't feel hemmed in and we loved being surrounded by wildlife. Monkeys running around was magical and an elephant walking through the hotel grounds was a first! We didn't see the resident croc but were lucky enough to see the loris on the night walk. (recommend booking this as it gets busy)
The food was excellent and we were particularly impressed with the choice at breakfast. We had a really early start one morning but they sent us off with some pastries and still welcomed us for breakfast on our return. 
The staff are amazing, particularly Thusara who looked after us throughout. We also loved the little touches like offering a small plate of snacks on arrival and  with evening drinks and putting sarongs in the bedrooms for the temples. 
It's in a perfect location for Dambula, Sigiriya, elephant safaris and Polonnaruwa.

Sigiriya,"Jetwing Vil Uyana, A Luxury Reserve",5,"An ideal place to experience peace and calm, while still enjoying luxury.","We stayed at Jetwing Vil Uyana and chose a Paddy Dwelling with a plunge pool. The room was spacious, with a simple yet luxurious interior, surrounded by rustling trees and the sounds of birds and other wildlife. It truly felt like we were immersed in nature.

We had a personal butler who catered to all our needs and ensured our stay was incredibly comfortable and peaceful. The entire staff was warm, attentive, and always ready to make our stay as relaxing as possible.

There were several excursions to choose from, and we went on the Loris Trail. Although we didn’t get to see any lorises, the naturalist shared fascinating insights about them and the ongoing conservation efforts within the premises.

Jetwing Vil Uyana is the epitome of eco-friendliness. Everything you see, smell, and touch feels like it belongs to the surroundings. The hotel is designed in a way that blends seamlessly with the natural habitat, causing minimal disturbance.

The entire place radiates peace and beauty. Traditional Sri Lankan architecture has been thoughtfully woven into a modern luxury setting, creating a truly unique atmosphere.

Kasiami did outstanding Balinese massage and Ningsih did a wonderful facial and massage for my wife. 
The location is a bit far from Columbo airport at about three hours and there are no nearby store, shops or village but everything else about this property is a five out of five from us.

As we were touring the cultural triangle through the day, we probably didn’t experience all that this retreat has to offer. The service provided by our personal butler Ravi was definitely next level. He always seemed to be there whenever we needed anything and couldn’t be more helpful. ( except when my other half asked if curry and chips were a possibility for dinner😂). The surroundings are so tranquil you could almost imagine it being a Buddhist temple where one could discover themselves. The lodges are spacious, immaculately clean and a perfect view when looking out from the bed in the morning. The food was exquisite with good choices.

We saw peacocks, water-monitor, monkeys, giant-squirrel, butterflies and numerous birds.  The lodge was extensive, secluded, lovely and with it's own plunge-pool.

The staff are very friendly, our butler Samman was particularly great. We stayed in a Marsh Dwelling. The room itself was very quirky and a unique experience which was fun. The bathroom is ""outside"", while still being private. Perhaps an odd experience, but there were alternate loos as well. 

We used the bath/spa in the room after hiking Sigiriya. Lovely deep bath, but be careful of frogs in the pipes! We accidentally boiled some... 🐸 

Our pool area was lovely and we got to see some ""greedy"" monkeys playing in the trees which was very special. 

The food was ok, not great not bad. The menu was the same everyday, so 3 days was enough time to get bored of the offering. The breakfast however was good. Try and spot the crocodile!

The spa was ok, good value. A 90 minute massage was £45 GBP. However, the spa treatment rooms are open above the water so there were a lot of bugs. 

Bugs are an inevitable of this hotel, due to location etc. However they are doing a lot to try and counteract them (citronella planting etc.)",Couples

Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,"A"" MUST GO TO "" destination!!","We spent 7 nights at Uga Chena Huts on an all inclusive basis booking via Emirates Holidays.  Very relaxed place to be and rather informal which we appreciated.  Situated on  a picturesque beach  (not suitable  for swimming) and  adjacent to  Yala National Park. Plenty of wildlife to see within the parameters of the hotel itself, hence the need to have a Ranger with you when walking the beach.  Cocktails and nibbles available daily at sunset from a beach bar. The Huts are nestled in the bushes , provide privacy, are spacious, luxurious and kept  immaculately clean with everything you would need, including laundry service.  Private decks are large and  have a shower ,  and each hut has its own jacuzzi- swimming pool.  We stayed in Hut 2 on arrival  for three nights and had lots of wildlife visitors throughout the day and night, especially monkeys which we immensely enjoyed watching . We moved to Hut 1 just to get an ocean view.  Not so many wildlife  visitors  to Hut 1 though an elephant did walk along the beach on our last evening!.  
Mini bar was free and well stocked though the  wines left a lot to be desired!!. Room was serviced twice a day.  Bed is enormous and extremely comfortable. Wifi is good and reliable. We used the hotel pool  and the spa facilities and thoroughly enjoyed them. 
The staff are  all exceptional. Every member of staff was  pleasant, polite, and couldn't do enough for you.  The food is extremely good, imaginative dishes, varied menu, quality,  fresh local  ingredients  and a chef who takes pride in what he produces.  What lets the restaurant down is the wine that is available. It's terrible, poor quality and limited choice  and not befitting of a 5* hotel or the fabulous food the chef produces.  We did mention it and we hope something is done to rectify this .  
We had the services of an excellent knowledgeable Ranger for our five safaris and we also visited Sithulpawwa Temple with him. He also took us   to a local fishing village and  on  a beach walk  in the vicinity of the hotel.  We saw everything we wanted to  on the Safari's and thoroughly enjoyed them. The hotel provides a picnic for each trip too.  
We would highly recommend this place.",Family
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,A Magical Escape into the Wild – Uga Chena Huts is Simply Unforgettable!,"From the moment we arrived at Uga Chena Huts, we knew we were in for something extraordinary. Nestled between the lush Yala jungle and the sparkling Indian Ocean, this luxury eco-resort effortlessly blends nature with elegance — and every moment we spent there felt like a dream.

The Vibe:
There’s a peaceful energy throughout the property — calming, rejuvenating, and full of soul. You’re surrounded by nature, but the comfort is uncompromising. The thatched-roof villas are spacious, beautifully appointed, and come with private plunge pools and outdoor decks where you can hear the jungle hum around you. It’s luxury in its most natural and refined form.

The Food & Gastronomy:
The culinary experience at Uga Chena Huts is second to none. Every meal was a celebration of Sri Lankan flavors, with an exquisite touch of international flair. From freshly caught seafood to fragrant local curries, each dish was crafted with care, creativity, and authenticity. A special thank you to Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara from the main restaurant, whose attentive service and warm smiles made every meal feel like a five-star experience — their hospitality was as unforgettable as the food itself.

The Safari Rides:
The game drives into Yala National Park were beyond thrilling. Our friendly ranger Sandun was not only incredibly knowledgeable but also genuinely passionate about the wildlife and the land. He brought the jungle to life with fascinating stories and insights, and we were lucky enough to witness some breathtaking animal encounters, including the majestic Sri Lankan leopard.

The Bar & Lounge Experience: Best smoothie ever, so do the cocktails.
Evenings at the lounge were something we looked forward to every day. Whether it was a craft cocktail or a custom creation inspired by local flavors, the bartenders never failed to impress. Huge thanks to Sathish and Nuwan, whose skill and charm behind the bar turned each drink into a celebration. Their energy and attention to detail added a vibrant and fun touch to our nights at Uga.

The Front Office & Service:
A very special thanks to Deshan and Dasun his front office colleagues at the front office who always pick us from buggy and guide us always — your kindness, constant support, and genuine care truly made us feel at home oh that sarcasm 😉 . From organizing our experiences to ensuring every detail was perfect, Deshan went above and beyond for us every step of the way. The entire front office team was friendly, efficient, and always ready with a warm smile — the true embodiment of Sri Lankan hospitality.

Final Thoughts:
Uga Chena Huts is more than just a luxury retreat — it’s a heartfelt experience where nature, comfort, and people come together in the most beautiful way. Thanks to the incredible team — especially Deshan, Sathish, Nuwan, Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara — our stay was filled with unforgettable moments, amazing flavors, wild adventures, and genuine human connection.

Unfortunately only one night for us, with an afternoon and morning safaris that were fantastic. We saw a family of elephants right up close and a pair of leopards - but we were told we had been very, very lucky. Lots of other wildlife including crocodile, deer, buffalo, peacocks and a wide range of other colourful and different birds. Hotel staff super helpful and the safari guide and driver amazing.

Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Luxury safari perfection!,"Absolutely flawless! I can’t fault our stay at all. The hotel is located in a beautiful part of the park with dramatic sea views that the hotels architecture makes the most off. 

The food was some of the best we’ve had at hotels in Sri Lanka.

Rooms are luxurious (the bed is insanely big and comfortable) and feel at one with nature, whilst also doing a good job of keeping the bugs/animals outside and sound proofing against nature! Having a pool right outside was a nice bonus in the heat. 

We visited the spa for massages in between safari rides and the massages were excellent! Definitely recommend a visit to the spa if you can. 

Our safari rides were amazing and we were fortunate enough to see the elephants and leopards! The hotel sends you out in small groups with their extremely knowledgeable rangers who are respectful of our comfort and of the national park and animals. 

Going out on safari with ranger Jabaya was the highlight, you could tell he really cared about the animals and about ensuring we had a good safari. Ultimately it’s all down to luck as to what you will and won’t see but his knowledge of the park and animal behaviours certainty helped us to see some amazing animals. 

The hotel had lots of little touches, like the snacks provided during the safari trips, and the sundowner session (beach front cocktails and canapés before dinner) which really helped to make the stay special. 

If you’re looking for a safari hotel/excursion which balances excellent safari trips, relaxation and luxury then this is undoubtably the hotel for you!",Friends
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Incredible,"We stayed for 2 nights but wish we stayed longer! 

Indhi and her team are fantastic and really added to our experience. Their attention to detail is fab, they knew who you were immediately. I mean everyone. We went to the beach for sundowners and the staff there knew I had an allergy without me saying so and recommended alternatives. 

We had some incredible food. The menu changes every 3/4 days so even on an extended stay you wouldn't get bored. My husband had some particularly good seafood. 

Safari itself was an amazing experience, rangers super knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely ruined me for other safaris as we were spoilt with drinks and snacks as well. The rangers & guides would come and check with you before your drive to ensure you knew what to expect.  Safety precautions were clear, we didn't have any issues and expectations were laid out. Ie we knew what to expect if an elephant did come into the hotel.",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Just perfect in every way....,"Completely fabulous experience- everything about this hotel is totally perfect, from the smooth and friendly check-in (even though we were early, the amazing food and drink, the location on the edge of the national park overlooking the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean, to the stunning 'huts'. And that's before you even go on a game drive  where they take care of every detail and use their knowledge, experience and  patience to give you the best possible experience.  Yes, it's expensive but the most incredible experience. Our guide Vibushana and the driver and spotter were just brilliant and were almost as excited as we were to see the leopards they got us to within 20 metres of. Cannot recommend this place, its manager Lisa and all the hardworking and charming staff highly enough.",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Natural paradise perfection,"We were lucky enough to spend 4 nights here with 5 safaris. Everything about our stay was perfect. We feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to have experienced Uga Chena. Firstly every member of staff will do anything to make sure your stay is beyond perfection. There is nothing they wouldn’t do for you. I couldn’t single out anyone as everyone who helped look after my family was just so wonderful. I have to say though our safari guide Jayaba was just the GOAT (my sons word!) and our driver we renamed Lewis Hamilton with  the best hair in Sri Lanka was the absolute best. Our safaris were incredible ….. off the beaten track away from the crowds so we really felt that it was just us in the park. We could see all the wonders of nature in its true beauty. We were truly blessed. 

The food is exceptional. Again nothing is too much trouble. My son has a severe peanut allergy and everyone was so careful which we were so grateful for. The portions were perfectly sized. During the safaris they pack you a selection of yummy snacks and drinks. The banana bread is divine! 

The resort itself is so sympathetically built into its environment with the respect the animals need. The pool area is lovely secluded to not attract any animals with attentive staff ready to bring you a refreshing cocktail. Sundowners on the beach each evening with snacks and more cocktails. 

The safaris take place at 6am and you are usually back for 9:30 to enjoy breakfast. The afternoon safaris take place at 3:15 and you are usually back by 6 for sun downers. Try to embrace all of the nature that Yala has to offer as I was just as guilty of it but if you become fixated on just wanting to see a leopard you will miss how beautiful your surroundings are. 

The huts themselves are spacious and luxurious. UK plugs and voltage. Laundry is included up to 15 items per day. We went in April and it was very warm so light clothing was all we needed. There are ponchos in the safari truck. Khaki coloured clothing is recommended to keep the insects away. Shorts  and a t shirt are fine even in the morning. With trainers. My husband wore flip flops … you don’t get out so you don’t need to wear sensible footwear but if you did need to get out in an emergency the terrain is muddy and uneven.  You can go straight to diner as you are. Or you can change for dinner into something more glam if you prefer. It isn’t formal though. But I did put a dress on two nights! 

Four nights felt like the perfect stay. As the resort is worth experiencing so you can relax. With four / five safaris. Our safaris were totally private which we preferred. The safaris are bumpy but it’s so much fun … And exhilarating. The safari jeeps are covered so you don’t need a hat and it will blow away unless you have string. 

You won’t be disappointed if you choose to stay here. It’s a truly a bucket list all round experience. 

Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.",Family
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,2,Waste of Money,"What a waste of money. Overrated. 

I’ll start with the positives: 

-Rooms are nice and spacious, maybe a touch dated but overall solid quality. Outdoor pool is good but again pretty dated. 

-Food is awesome. Not the best we had in Sri Lanka but very solid cooking. 

Now the negatives:

-Safaris are laughable. This was supposed to be the highlight of the stay and the reason to go to Yala. Our guide was essentially useless - did not point things out, just sat in the car. Driving was erratic at best and dangerous at worst. We almost canceled the rest of our stay after the first night it was so bad. 

-Management was nowhere to be found. We brought up our negative safari experience to the front desk and asked to speak with a manager - this resulted in them sending over the safari guide who we proceeded to have a highly confrontational, uncomfortable, and awkward conversation with. 

-The wine list is comically bad. For an all-inclusive hotel priced at $1500+/night I expect better than $5/bottle wine. And even the options to purchase were limited / uninteresting. 

At the end of the day, there are FAR better resorts for FAR less $ in Sri Lanka. Shoutout to Haritha Villas & Spa in Hikkaduwa (for example). 

Uga Chena is way overhyped and incredibly overpriced. Most of the time we were saying things like “damn - I really wish this hotel was as good as their marketing.”",Couples

He spoke clearly in English and made us feel very comfortable and well cared for. 
 Thank you.",Couples
Ahungalla,Heritance Ahungalla,3,The best average hotel,"Let's start with the best part of our experience - super friendly staff. We had lots of nice interactions with everyone starting from the Guest Experience Officer lady, through bartenders and cooks, finishing on life guards and security. We want to emphasize work of guys from pool bar (and probably misspell their names :) ) - captain Nelka, captain Kalinga, barman Jogatia and Thamsha. Unquestionably staff is the strongest point of that hotel.
Hotel is located next to the wonderful sand beach with tropical flora and fauna. It doesn't look like another boring hotel from Turkey, Spain or Greece. Its architecture is something refreshing and memorable.
Rooms also look very pleasant and not cheap. However the first problems appear there. It takes time to understand how light switches are organized and there is no main light source on the ceiling. Instead we got a big fan which was pointless with working air conditioning. Also if you are scared of insects better be prepared to meet some in the bathroom after rains. Hotel staff proposed us change of the room but we chose just additional insect spraying. If you want to go to tropics, expect tropical animals. :)
Huge disadvantage of this hotel is lack of any activities. Live band performances were the only thing happening there. We saw an animator maybe once when they were flying kites with kids. The animation plan in the hallway had nothing to do with reality. If you want to only sunbath, swim and chill it could be the advantage but it is not what is being sold here.
Food was mostly good but there was also some inedible foods. South Asian cuisine itself is very tasty and you will be able to experience that here. However some pork was impossible to bite and chicken almost always contained little bones which can make you choke to death.
Overall this hotel is nice but it is not a five star experience. It was just like an average three star hotel in Europe but located in more exotic location. Friendly staff is the biggest jewel in its crown. Next are beautiful beach and big main pool. Beside these three things Heritance Ahungalla doesn't offer anything memorable.

In the end it is important to mention locals selling trips and clothes next to the hotel. You will always encounter them when going to the beach or even walking next to the fence. They are very friendly but remember that every interaction is meant to sell you more stuff with relatively high price. But if you negotiate prices and stay assertive, you can have a great experience for relatively low cost.",Couples

Ahungalla,Heritance Ahungalla,5,Amazing stay at Heritance Ahungalla !!!,"This property over looking the sea offers a buffet to die for and an implacable service provided  by the staff.
While I was present lobster was offered in the buffet. Crispy prawns were offered to me  when I said I did not see it, for a mistake made by me. Finger sandwiches of variety was offered at breaky which was a nice touch !!!
Request a room close to the lift if you have difficulty in walking. Rooms have been well
maintained with all modern facilities though it is an old resort. Evening entertainment there as well. 
Staff extremely friendly ready  to help anytime. They helped me to get great shots of the resort, also did not forget to say goodbye at my departure. 
No loyalty program yet in place which is a draw back for frequent visitors.

The infinity pool was just mesmerizing and they had unique chalets as well. The inside of the chalet had a large bathroom and the bedroom was not that much spacious but it was cozy and nice. I was so in love with the hotel but One thing I experienced was the bad smell that came out of the washroom as the room and the bathroom was kinda connected through a door. We informed the necessary parties about this and they came to fix the smell but the bad smell was still there. That was the only negative thing that I encountered. We went snorkeling in the morning and got to see the most insane beautiful unrealistic sunset that i have ever seen as the sky was blood red and orange. I wish I could capture that moment but couldn’t as my phone battery died. I would love to visit this hotel again as this was that good.,Couples

Pasikuda,Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa - Thema Collection,4,All in all we would really recommend this place. From food to cleanliness and the amazing beach!,"We had a great experience here. Rooms were very clean. Service really tried their best to make us feel homely. From the amenities we used the Spa for massages and had a glorious time there. We also went snorkeling which was great. Beach was very clean and they provided for everything. The gym is small but it has some free weights and even a bench. Regarding the food we only had breakfast booked and ate dinner in the a la carte restaurants. (2 of them there). They really did their best to accommodate for my gluten free diet ( Including a very good gluten free bread for breakfast) Also they really went out of their way to decorate our room for my birthday.
They also have a separate room for activities such as table tennis and pool. 
Only thing to improve on: whenever there was a larger group we had to wait for service for a long time. Waiters as well as house keeping. They needed to be reminded several times for us to get more water for our room for example. (So that in the end we went and got it ourselves) The available staff is extremely kind however there are just too few of them. Dinner took us at least 2.5 hours - and not because we are such slow eaters. You are here for vacation after all so we were not stressed on time however you do need patience and reminders.",Family

The infinity pool is the place to be during the day or the late evening and the comforts of the accommodations are of highest quality.

Husband, wife, adult daughter and 10 year old son. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Was worried it was going to be a hot room for us but with the airconditioning and fans, the room was cool/cold enough for a perimenopause person. The shower was nice, not airconditioning but it had a fan. Breakfast was great-must try egg hopper plus pork bacon. We asked the chef to have a seafood feast on our last night and they delivered. 2 lobsters, 8 prawns and some crabs. You can dine in the main dining area, no airconditioning but lots of fans. Overall a great relaxing trip. Everything was clean, our rooms are cleaned everyday, water refilled. The men came around at night to refill any water bottles and the mini fridge/bar inside your room. Ruchie the activities coordinator kept our 10 year old entertained, played cricket, volleyball, made sandcastles, etc. If you are looking for the elephant print pants, I only found it in one store.

The hotel manager goes out of his way to speak to you on a daily basis, checking everything is OK. A special mention to Rupan for really looking after us and Robinson AKA  Denzel Washington for being a brilliant bartender. The organised trips are also reasonably priced and I would thoroughly recommend the short bicycle trip as a way of seeing the local region, as this was expertly led by our fantastic concierge.

Sigiriya,"Jetwing Vil Uyana, A Luxury Reserve",4,"Beautiful setting, lovely room","We booked a pool villa (see photo), which was very spacious and well appointed, on two floors, with its own pool (obv!). Although the bedroom upstairs had an on suite toilet, the shower was downstairs.  But a first world problem, admittedly!

Weirdly for such an upscale hotel, bathrobes were not provided, especially given the remoteness of the shower from the bedroom, quite a walk!  

We only had one dinner and the food was very good

Service was not flawless but mostly decent enough.  Our room came with a butler but when we arrived (within 90 seconds of the exact time when we told them we would, in response to an earlier Whatsapp) he was on his break!  

The check-in was slow which is not what one wants after a long drive. 

We were only there one night, as a stopover to break the very long drive from the tea country to the north-east beyond Trincomalee.  So did not really have enough time to relax and enjoy the facilities. The resort is designed to be Eco-friendly, and has a spa, but we did not use so cannot comment. 

So a few small things prevent me giving five stars but don't let that put you off, especially if you like to commune with nature!!",Couples

The food was of limited menu at an average standard with few local flavours. 
The rooms and facilities are spread out over a wide area;  several maintenance issues were frustrating - gates, gym equipment, toilets, bathrooms etc at the resort all had broken/dirty items requiring engineer attention. 
The resort presents as a luxury stay but falls short of expectations in that arena. 
Some good wildlife walk options offered by the resort are well worth the effort.",Couples

Sigiriya,"Jetwing Vil Uyana, A Luxury Reserve",5,Jetwing Vil Uyana,"The Jetwing Vil Uyana is an unusual hotel which blends into its natural surroundings. When wandering through the grounds, you will see monkeys birds, fish and the evenings are filled with the sounds of frogs. There are Fishing Cats and even a crocodile but we didn't see either. We had a Garden Room which was fine but maybe a little tired. Some rooms were being upgraded while we were there so, hopefully all will get a refresh. The food was great and the whole ambience at the hotel was so peaceful. My only slight negative would be the distance from some rooms to Reception and the restaurants. It is along sandy paths and could get quite muddy if raining. Despite this, we would still highly recommend a stay at the Vil Uyana. We would like to give a very special mention to Ravi (Ravinder).

Incredible room overlooking the lake with luxury touches like a deep double bath, compliments mini bar, veranda overlooking the lake and amazing aircon (our room was like a fridge when we woke up). The food was exceptional (especially the Sri Lankan curries) and the service very attentive. Lakshan, our personal host, was so helpful and happy to talk to us….he’ll go far.

Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,5,Our dream honeymoon at 98 acres resort and spa,"Our Dream Honeymoon at 98 Acres Resort

We chose 98 Acres Resort & Spa for our honeymoon, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. The resort is nestled among beautiful tea plantations with breathtaking views of Ella Gap, offering the perfect peaceful and romantic atmosphere.

Our chalet was charming and thoughtfully designed, blending beautifully with the natural surroundings. Waking up to the misty mountains and the sounds of nature was a dream. We especially loved relaxing on our private balcony — it quickly became our favorite spot to just sit back and enjoy the moment together.

A particularly memorable part of our stay was a traditional blessing ritual arranged by the resort. It was such a meaningful experience and added a lovely cultural touch to our honeymoon.

We also had complimentary access to the Ravana Pool Club, which had a great vibe and gave us the chance to unwind in a fun and relaxing setting. It was definitely a highlight of our trip!

While everything was truly special, we thought that a honeymoon cake or some romantic bed decorations could have made it feel even more personalized. Maybe it’s something the resort could offer future honeymooners.

All in all, our stay at 98 Acres was unforgettable. The staff were so warm and welcoming, and every detail was taken care of. We made some beautiful memories and would recommend this place to any couple looking for a peaceful and scenic getaway.",Couples

Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,4,Family Holiday Experience,"This was our second stop in Sri Lanka with family. 
We were all so in awe of the amazing picturesque views from pretty much every area of the facility. Our rooms had endless views of the canyon and mini Adams peak. So wonderful to wake up to and have a relaxing morning on the balcony. 
The room was so well layed out and spacious. Especially the shower and being able to look at the view while enjoying the rain head shower. 
Only negative would be to put a screen on the balcony door so you have the option of leaving open to allow ventilation. Especially as there is no AC. The fan however was ok. 
The restaurant and food was outstanding. Great touch having live music every night. 
One very disappointing experience was the Pekou tour that was organised by the staff manager with their inhouse naturalist (Sam). It was for 5 of us which cost 50usd each. Very expensive but we were happy to pay for the experience. 
Unfortunately Sam did not explain too much and seemed to be in a hurry as he was always well ahead of half of us. We asked for a toilet break only to be told there was not one available. 
Towards the end we wend down a very challenging descent which was very overgrown and we all experienced scratches and irritations as we had shorts. Sam had trousers and was oblivious to this. 
We were very disappointed with Sam and his lack of attention and knowledge of the area. 
Please in future pre-warn the guests of what to expect so we could be better prepared. Overall the 3 hour walk was very enjoyable and challenging. 
This did not take away from the excellent experience at your facility.",Family

The room was also gorgeous. We stayed in a suite, and the room had a GIANT soaking tub - like took 40 minutes to fill giant. It was SO wonderful to relax in after a long day! The staff also left us a beautiful bed design to celebrate our anniversary upon check-in, which was a wonderful extra touch!

The hotel offers a lot to do and you could easily spend a few days here. The on-site restaurant was very good, and the breakfast was large and delicious.

We only had one issue during our stay. During check-out, they were so kind as to do a blessing for my husband and I, giving us each a bracelet and box of tea. Immediately following, housekeeping came up and tried to imply we stole a face towel, which we absolutely did not. And despite a few minutes of back and forth, we left feeling really weird about it.

A great experience overall.",Family

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Luxury is the people that makes it ⭐️,"Where do I start;

The people ❣️ I always say and it has been said that sometimes it’s not about the property but about the people who brings out the luxury of a property. The kindness, attention to detail and the genuine service.
I booked the property same day directly at the hotel as I needed to get out of the previous property that I stayed for a night only and cause I want service and a place that is well maintained. 
Jake at the reception who accommodated with the last minute was very accommodative and patient to show me the room as I needed to have a look before I complete the booking and he has been helpful through out. Nimanthi who escorted me to the room very kind and also has been accommodative during my stay. Chathuranga from housekeeping also was great with his service and nothing is ever too much. Chanil from Weligama restaurant always with a smile and go out of his way to make sure all is going well and that I am comfortable. I asked him for mangoes and he brought two types so I get to try and see which one I like best, I mean now this is service not just cause I asked but went above what has been asked ⭐️.  Dilsha such a sweet heart, lovely conversation and as a solo traveler plus a lady there is a lot that can be. I think the property is very protective, conservative at a point and make sure that you are comfortable at all times and do whatever it takes to make you feel safe.
Thank you Randula Assisstant FO Manager that connected me with Dilshan from big fish restaurant who accommodated my customized food request and to be served in the room, he was such a charm.
 I wish I could remember everyone’s name that I encounter but just know that you all played a great role and have exceeded my expectations. I mean even the security team is just so kind and you can feel their positive energy.
3 nights well spent and it’s hard to fault anything when you have such team.

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,3,Disappointing stay .. nice property but untrained staff,"Nice property with surfing opportunities at the beach but significantly untrained staff and not a great recognition for marriott bonvoy elite members. Issues with late check out which was promised at time of check in and retracted the next morning until raised with the GM who kindly sorted it out. Strange experience at the pool where the staff started to close the umbrellas where we were sitting without providing any explanation. When countered they said winds are high. Strangely they closed 4-5 umbrellas and left the others almost 25 as it is. When confronted they had no answer why? Raised to the GM but did not receive any explanation till date as to why it was done selectively 

Bad experience with room service - specifically asked for 4 plates while ordering lunch and only got 3. Had to wait for another 15 mins for the 4th plate to arrive

The welcome card at the hotel is placed without writing your name. Shows how untrained the staff is 

Asked for an extra bed in the room and they said that they have zero roll away beds in hotel and can only provide spa mattress on the floor !! Very surprised that a marriott hotel keeps not even a single roll away bed in the hotel. 

Overall a nice property but disappointing experience due to staff. Staff is what makes the hotel and sadly at this property that is missing. They may take a lesson or two from nearby Sheraton property at Kosgoda where the staff are brilliant",Family

One of the highlights was the stunning view from our room—it truly added a special touch to our visit and made our time there even more memorable. The room itself was spotless, spacious, and thoughtfully arranged, clearly maintained with a high standard of cleanliness and care.

The staff were another standout. Every team member we interacted with was friendly, professional, and eager to help. 

However, one area that could use improvement is the dining experience. While the food was generally of good quality, there was a noticeable lack of variety in the menu during our stay. After a few meals, it felt quite repetitive, and we would have appreciated more diverse options to choose from.

Overall, this hotel offers a great combination of cleanliness, comfort, excellent service, and scenic views. With a bit more attention to the variety of food offered, it would be nearly perfect.",Family

The hotel interior, the view, the location, everything was impeccable. The rooms have a great view and offer a lot of different activities and games for all age groups.
But most of all we have to commend the services provided by all the staff members. We have to especially thank the kitchen team, the chef and especially Mr. Chamuditha. We are a Jain family of 11, hailing from India, with a lot of food restrictions that are generally unheard of in Sri Linka. We were able to personally coordinate all our meals with the chefs and the trainee chefs with Mr. Chamuditha as our mediator. We had a total of 6 meals at the hotel and not a single one was disappointing. They have accomodated our every need with a smiling face. Coming to Sri Lanka we were already worried about the availability of Vegetarian food let alone Jain, but we can now go back and say with surety that no such issue can occur at The Heritance.
Thank you to the whole team for making our stay such a memorable one! Hope to visit again soon!",Family

Ahungalla,Heritance Ahungalla,5,A wonderful experience 5***,"Heritance is a precious jewel on the southern shore. Designed originally by the visionary architect Geoffrey Bawa who brought the beautiful flora of Sri Lanka inside, incorporating it into the building. Expanded tastefully by the present owners. Giving its guests a comfortable and pampered experience. 

Set on a sandy shore with sea rolling in. Catering for all with that Sri Lankan smile and hello, you are welcomed to a wonderful experience. Mind relaxing and cleansing for the body and soul. Rejuvenated until the next time. 

Catering for every taste, a banquet awaits in dining experience, fit for any royal table. 

I congratulate and thank you for my amazing stay. Look forward to returning to the family. 

This is a sinhalese inheritance, please keep it that way. 

With thanks,

Ahungalla,Heritance Ahungalla,5,Just what I needed.,"I really liked the low level design of this hotel layout, with it's stunning, open reception, roofless courtyards with typical plants and tress, so you felt right in nature. That was one of it's selling points to me. I wanted a relaxing holiday and that's what I got staying here. I was very pleased with my room on the third floor, over looking the 'quiet pool' with the India Ocean in the back ground, it was a view to die for. My housekeeper Lasan kept my room very clean and tidy and entertained me each day with his towel origami and restock of bottled water.  I did have a minor issue at the beginning of my holiday in the Jutes restaurant with the waiting staff, as they are not assertive or aware enough when you sit at your table of asking you if you want water or drinks, I had to keep asking and I wasn't the only one (maybe more training needed?) but this was quickly sorted by Supervisor Chamuditha, whom I was very impressed with, by his professional manner of rectifying this issue and on my every visit to Jutes for the rest of my holiday I was well looked after by him or in his absence his colleague Supervisor Waruna. The buffet style layout is large over two areas with a lot of verity, which I found good and plentiful. I was on the All Inclusive package, which suited me, but  'Western Branded' alcohol is chargeable.  The evening entertainment was ok, but could be improved upon and there was no native entertainment. All, in all I have to say I really liked the relaxing vibe of this hotel and the staff's way of a slower pace of life, which you do have to get used to, but I do think they could take their customer service up a level, and it's not 'Western world' standard 5*, but it's very clean, comfortable and very unique in it's architecture and the staff were professional, polite, helpful and friendly.  For me personally, as a female solo traveller I felt very safe at all times.  Would I return? yes I would.",Solo

Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,3,A bit of a let down,"Stayed for 2 nights and went on 2 safari drives. We came here largely for the safari experience - particularly to see leopards and also elephants, sloth bears, mongoose, etc in their natural environment. We have done a couple of safaris in South Africa and Botswana, and hoped this would be similar in terms of animal spotting. Unfortunately, for us, the whole experience didn’t live up to what we hoped. The safari vehicles are limited to driving on roads (unlike other parts of the world where they can go off-road) that hundreds of other jeeps/trucks of tourists were on, leading to lots of dust and few animal sightings (other than the water buffalo, peacocks and birds that are all over). Our guide explained that the animals go inside the bush away from the cars/roads (understandably). We had planned to do a 3rd safari drive, but after the first two, we cancelled the 3rd.  Of course, the hotel can’t control the crowds or ensure we saw a leopard, but having come here for the animal experience, we were disappointed with the experience. In hindsight, this was an expensive and time consuming (3 days/2 nights) part of our trip for a safari experience that for us was underwhelming. 

The hotel itself was nice, but lacked some special touches to make it truly exceptional/5 star. For example, cold towels would be a nice gesture to offer guests when they return from game drives - it’s dusty and hot out there and would be nice so we could clean our hands. The restaurant needed better ventilation/a/c - though there are a few wall a/c units and some fans, it still was very hot during lunch. Also, some fans seemed to be broken as when we asked if they could be sped up, the staff said they could not. Food itself was fine.  One time we also found that the bathrooms by the restaurant were both out of soap even though it was just 10am.  We asked the front desk for soap, but he said it would “take some time” so we instead walked back to our huts to wash our hands before returning to our breakfast. 

Staff is kind and friendly.",Family
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Perfection - we did not want to leave!,"We had a two night stay at Uga Chena Huts in Suite 1, with a fantastic view of the Indian Ocean from our large deck and plunge pool. Uga Chena Huts is in an incredible location, beachfront with amazing views of the Indian Ocean from the bar, restaurant and the magical evening sunset bar on the beach.

Service was exceptional in all parts of the resort; check in, meal service, bar service and housekeeping were all of the highest standard with friendly, professional and well trained staff. 

There is a great variety of cocktails, spirits, wine, beer and other beverages available from the all inclusive offering, and we found the meal quality for breakfast, lunch and dinner to be of a high quality, with dietary issues / substitutions no problem at all. 

Our hut was spacious, luxurious and everything was of a high standard. 

We did two safari drives and the vehicle, drivers and guides are great. As Uga Chena Huts is so well run, it was great on a morning safari drive having the ability to drive past the 100 odd safari jeeps lined up to get into Yala National Park and enter the park straight away. 

The great location ensured plenty of animal spotting even from the resort including monkeys and a sloth bear walking across the driveway. The highlight was sitting at the bar in the evening whilst sipping wine and watching a large elephant walk through the resort illuminated by the moonlight. 

We absolutely loved our stay, our only complaint was that we only stayed for two nights and wished we had of stayed longer!",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,A unique hotel,Uga Chena Huts is fabulous place to stay. Set right by the ocean it is committed to sustainability. The room was large beautiful appointed with a private plunge pool. The food was delicious and all the staff were delightful. It has a unique setting. Each suite has a very private feel surrounded by lush vegetation. It is great to be able to walk to the edge of the grounds and look down on the sea though there is a strict no go area onto the beach due to the danger of the sea and at night the potential of wild animals. We took a day safari into Yala National Park. Our ranger from the hotel was Dush who was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and  tried to enable us to see all our top requests. The driver was particularly skilled and between them we could not have had a better team. Due to a monsoon downpour we did not see a Leopard but that only means I will have to return to this wonderful hotel. Strangely the room was a little under lit which was a bit frustrating especially after dark. Other than that it was faultless. Go and experience Chena Huts you will not be disappointed.,Friends

Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Everything excellent!,"OMG what can I say about this hotel that hasn’t already been said . . . Everything from the moment you check in to the moment you leave is excellent.  They don’t stop feeding you and the food is first class. They also try to collect you and deliver you everywhere you want to go by golf cart so you don’t even need to walk anywhere!  Even though each ‘hut’ has a plunge pool  we used the hotel pool one morning and we were the only guests there.  It was shady and monkeys were playing in the trees for a while when we were there so it was even better.  We wanted a drink and nobody was about so we asked in the spa and a member of staff was immediately dispatched to the pool area and stayed there until we left!
Only one very small point. The lighting in the hut is quite subdued which is fine most of the time, except as a lady when you are trying to get ready to go to dinner.
A part from that it was superb and thanks to everyone for making our stay and our 2 safaris so good 😄",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,3,5 Star Price Tag for a 3 Star resort - issues that could so easily be fixed with money and more imagination.,"After over 40 years of traveling, from ultra-luxurious five-star hotels to charming two-star surprises, we embarked on a three-week journey through Sri Lanka, staying at some of the country’s best properties. Wild Coast Tented Lodge? Outstanding. Eraeliya Weligama? Outstanding. Ceylon Tea Trails? Fantastic. Then came UGA Chena Huts—an experience so underwhelming it left us wondering how on earth this place maintains its high rating.

This is not a five-star resort. It is, at best, a three-star establishment charging luxury prices while coasting on its location and reputation. The owners have clearly decided that “good enough” is the standard, rather than investing in what could be a truly exceptional experience.

THE POSITIVES:

✔️ Spectacular location with breathtaking views over the Indian Ocean.

✔️ Kind and professional staff—they are trying their best despite what they have to work with.

✔️ Food is decent—not exceptional, but not terrible either.

✔️ Nice sundowner setting—a moment of peace before the reality of the resort kicks back in.

✔️ Beautiful beach dinner arrangements—a rare highlight.

✔️ Decent open-air bar area—nothing special, but at least functional AND OPEN …

✔️ Excellent safari rangers—if only the resort matched their level of professionalism.

THE NEGATIVES:

1. DATED, DATED, DATED.

The entire property screams neglect. This isn’t “rustic luxury” or “understated charm”—it’s just old, tired, and uninspired.

2. The Huts? Large but Utterly Soulless.

Yes, they are spacious. But space means nothing when it’s filled with boring, outdated furniture and zero atmosphere. Staying here feels more like being in a forgotten timeshare unit than a luxury retreat.

3. The Plunge Pools? A Complete Joke.

I cannot stress this enough—the so-called private plunge pools are an atrocity. Small, cheap plastic tubs, with tiny, worn-down decks that wouldn’t even be acceptable in a low-budget roadside motel. How anyone thought this was an acceptable feature for a luxury resort is beyond comprehension.

4. The Main Pool? An Absolute Misery.

Instead of using the stunning ocean views to create an infinity pool masterpiece, they’ve hidden it in the bushes. No atmosphere, no view—just an uninspired, lifeless pool area that feels like an afterthought.

5. No Proper Pool Bar – Just a Slow, Overworked Server on a Bicycle.

Want a drink by the pool? Be prepared to wait an eternity. There’s no real bar—just a lone staff member who has to bike over to fetch your order. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a beer or soda. If you want anything more complex—good luck.

6. The Dining Room? A Glass Prison.

Whoever designed the main restaurant must have hated nature, because instead of making the most of the setting, they shoved it inside a glass aquarium with AC. You can technically dine outside, but space is ridiculously limited. It’s a total mystery why a resort that markets itself as an “immersive nature retreat” has such an unwelcoming, uninspired dining experience.

7. The Food? Decent, but Laughably Boring.

For a so-called high-end resort, the lack of imagination in the menu is astonishing. And the ultimate insult? The ice cream selection: Vanilla and Chocolate. That’s it. In a country famous for tropical fruits, that’s all they could come up with?

FINAL VERDICT: A LUXURY RESORT IN NAME ONLY

Would UGA Chena Huts ever be a real five-star resort? Yes—IF the owners actually invested in it.

• The dining area? Rip out that dreadful glass box and open it up to the surroundings.

• The main pool? Move it, make it an infinity pool with ocean views, and give it a proper bar. Surround the bar and the “ new Dining area “ with an infinity pool ! Just copy what they have masterfully done elsewhere - like The Wild Coast Tented lodge 5 minutes away.

• The huts? Renovate them with actual luxury in mind, instead of letting them rot in outdated mediocrity.

• The plunge pools? Tear them out and build something worthy of the price you are  charging.

Right now, this place is a a bit of a joke. Upscale travelers aren’t stupid—they know when they’re being overcharged for mediocrity. If you want to throw your money at a subpar three-star resort disguised as a five-star experience, be my guest. But if you’re looking for true luxury, look elsewhere.",Family
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Hospitality at its perfection,"Hospitality at its perfection. We were taken care of even before we arrived and it didn’t end until we unfortunately had to leave. We stayed 2 nights and will definitely be back one day. 

A very well trained and organised team all working together to please their guests in an unbelievably beautiful environment. 

The “huts” are expensive but worth every cent.  Cuisine (including vegetarian needs!) and choice of beverages were remarkable. There was one comment concerning toilet privacy which is true, but that can be avoided by the partner going for a swim in your own pool. 

It would be unfair to name one member of the staff for his work as they all worked together as a team and were always in for a joke. The safari tours are a must even if you don’t get to see the leopard or the famous tusk elephant, the guides and the drivers are enthusiasts all the way. Thanks. 

Keep up the standard.",Family
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Paradise!,"On arrival we were greeted by Salman with the words ""welcome to paradise|"". And it was. Highlights are many but include the wonderful bungalow with its view of the lake (and bathing water buffalo); the sundowners on the beach over-looking the Indian Ocean; the amazing, creative and tasty food (all made on site to the highest standard); the fabulous cocktails; and the awe-inspiring safari with our knowledgeable ranger. Having elephants pass a few feet in front of our jeep was an unforgettable experience. But the icing on the cake was the amazing staff who, without exception, were friendly, helpful and professional. Seems unfair to single anyone out from such an outstanding crew, but a special thanks to Deshan for making us laugh on every buggy journey (sorry we missed your leopard suit!) and Sanjeewa for the 1st rate cookery class which we got to enjoy for our lunch.  This is that rare place - a truly all-inclusive resort.",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,AMAZING FABULOUS UNFORGETTABLE,"Paradise.
We stayed at Una Chena Huts for 8 nights and it was absolutely fabulous.
As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff and offered a beautiful welcome drink. I knew we were going to have an amazing holiday.
One of the best holidays I have ever experienced.
The huts are beautifully appointed villas with a large pool.
The room is huge, with  a fully stocked mini bar, a massive comfortable bed, The toiletries are plentiful and there is a separate very large toilet and separate shower.
Our villa had a view of the lake where we would see our resident water buffalo who I named Bert every day just wallowing in the water keeping cool.
Every evening at 6pm we were invited for drinks at the sundowner bar on the beach overlooking the beautiful ocean.
The restaurant served amazing silver service breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The choice of food was fabulous with a choice of 4 course European  or Sri Lankan specialties.
The chef would come and say hello during dinner to ensure the meal was satisfactory.
During  our stay we were visited by an elephant walking to reception, an elephant on the beach who made his way to the restaurant and reception. Monkey family enjoying the freedom of the resort.
One particular evening on returning to the villa from a night enjoying fabulous food and drinks we were greeted by Bert our water buffalo on the porch of our villa munching on the greenery and when he was full he wandered behing our villa of our villa.
Uga Chena Huts have a fabulous team of guides who arrange and take you on the safaris. We were lucky to be offered 2 safaris a day one early in the morning and one late afternoon.
Our guide Kalihdu was absolutely fabulous, his knowledge was exceptional. He was super friendly and changed our route through the park every day.
We were so lucky to watch a leopard just chilling in the bush who then decided to sit in front of our 4x4 just relaxing and cleaning herself for 5 minutes then we had the same experience with an elephant.
It was surreal seeing these beautiful animals in the natural habitat.
The animals we saw were leopards, elephants, water buffalo’s, monkeys, crocodiles, deer and an amazing array of birds.
All the staff at Una Chena Huts are absolutely fabulous. Leezel Daniel The resident manager must be so proud of all her staff. They were exceptional, always had a beautiful smile and going above and  beyond to ensure our stay was unforgettable.
Una Chena Huts is paradise and we will definitely return.",Couples

We highly recommend.",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Perfection all the way!,"We stayed for 3 nights at Uga Chena Huts. It was a great amount of time - and 4 nights might just be better to thoroughly enjoy the property as well as Yala. 

The room was such a great respite after the crazy Yala drives. So much space to sprawl out. Such a comfy bed and pillows. Great shower and pressure. The deck with pool was lovely and really enjoyed hearing the waves from the ocean and the birds. Only criticism is the toilet room - it needs a roof for privacy - no one wants to hear their loved  one’s issues going on in there! 

The service was spot on! They worked so hard to make eveyone happy and cared for. A shout out to Janith our ranger - he was so knowledgeable and made the drives fun and tailored them to my needs after I said no more bumpy “main road” of Yala - so helpful! (And on that note make sure to book Spa appointments! Your sore body will thank you after those safari drives) Tea in the spa was excellent! 

The food - amazing! Always ready to cater to our needs when we needed to change it up because of preferences. I will remember the fluffy truffle eggs from breakfast forever!! Best breakfasts I’ve ever had. And the quantity of food - you will never go hungry - ever! I had to start just having soup for lunch to save room for Safari snacks which is actually just lunch to go - and so good to! 

I can’t say enough or praise the property and people enough - wonderful in every sense. Oh and an elephant even made a visit to the car park where you board the safari vehicles as well as wild boar to top it all off! 

Thanks so much Uga Chena Huts!!",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Near Perfect Ocean Hideaway.  Wonderful.,"Uga Chena Huts offer a near-perfect 'Robinson Crusoe' boutique hotel experience.  (A mile away, the Wild Coast hotel offers a less-good experience, and costs more.)

The Uga Chena rooms are high-ceilinged and airy, many with views of the adjacent lagoon; the contemporary dining room and reception areas are beautifully designed - simple, pared-down and elegant - and the staff are smiling and attentive.

At sunset, they light a brazier on the beach and offer complimentary cocktails to watch the sun go own, with the roar of the ocean immediately adjacent.  Memories really are made of this.  The setting is utterly unspoilt and magical and surpassed our expectations.

Would we go back?  Absolutely.  A two or three night stay is probably best.",Couples

Special mentions have to go to the chefs for their fantastic food(we particularly liked the cookery demonstration and guide of the kitchens). The head waiter runs the restaurant with enthusiasm that runs all the way through his staff. Dush, our ranger, has a fountain of knowledge and such passion for the job he obviously loves, we learnt so much from him. A minor issue was poor lighting in the room, for ladies especially, however this didn’t detract from the ambiance and beauty of the spacious room.We both thank you for such a memorable stay.",Couples

At mealtimes Chinthaka was an engaging host and we were delighted to enjoy a table on the sand by lamplight on our final night. Thank you so much.
Our guide Kalindu was incredibly knowledgeable and alongside our driver made sure we had 3 unique drives looking at different aspects of the wonderful national park. Seeing a leopard cub stalking a buffalo calf was incredibly special and thank you to the driver ( sorry I didn’t get your name) for getting us to the perfect position to watch it. The national park is overcrowded with jeeps but we managed to steer clear of the queues and still see great wildlife. Thank you.
Finally to the behind the scenes team who maintain the high standards across the property. Thank you.

Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,The only place to stay for your Sri Lankan safari!,"Luxurious special jungle escape! The villas are gorgeous, well stocked w its own pool. Having safaris 2x per day included in the package was brilliant! Ranger Kalindu was with us for our stay and we got to see leopards, elephants, crocodiles, jackals, all types of birds and more. 

The food feels plucked from top restaurants (hats off to Chef Nuwan) combining traditional Sri Lankan specialties with European flair. You definitely won’t go hungry with their 4 course meal service, sundowner specials on the beach (happy hour drinks + appetizers) and many desserts! They arranged a beautiful dinner on the beach for our final night by a mesmerizing fire. What a treat!

And what would an amazing hotel be without great service? Ask for Nuwan as your server - he anticipates your needs and knew all our likes / dislikes quickly.

It is an oasis of low key luxury. The staff, accommodations, and food are all outstanding!
The safaris are an experience of a lifetime. Our zoologist Johnny made the trip for us. His knowledge of everything in the park was interesting and fascinating! In both rain and sunshine we saw many species of  birds, elephants, a leopard and so much more.  A shout out to our driver who handled the vehicle in all terrains and water levels!  A must visit place!!",Couples
Palatupana,Uga Chena Huts,5,Simply stunning,"This was a simply amazing.  When you find the place it is a long dirt track from the main road (which is quite normal in Sri Lanka) and Uga Chena is at the end past the Hilton, Cinnamon and a couple of other places down this road.  

So glad we picked the Uga Chena though as we could not fault it.  From the amazing HUGE room to the warm, friendly, helpful, brilliant team working there.  Uga have a few hotels throughout Sri Lanka and they vary greatly in price and facilities, Uga Chena is up there on price, but what you get is unparalleled and we had quite an adventure just in our 3 days there.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed most warmly and felt at home straight away.  As we walked to the restaurant a monitor lizard was fishing in the pond and caught a fish which was amazing to watch.  

The restaurant is small and intimate with aircon indoor seating and covered outdoor seating available.  There is an outdoors bbq where some items are prepared - the food is freshly prepared each day and the menu changes dependent upon what they have fresh that day.  My favourite was the lobster and Kris’s was the steak. But the curries are all delicious.

We had a culinary demonstration which was a treat and the prawn curry chef cooked was delicious.  

The outside bar and ‘sundowner’ bar are a treat with the bar close to the restaurant and the sundowner out near the beach, the weather and animals do not always allow the sundowner to operate, so go there when you can.  

The room is simply amazing - you will not be disappointed.  The bed is enormous, you can both starfish.  toiletries and amenities are plentiful with separate toilet and shower (excellent pressure), large bath, twin sinks and great aircon. The minibar is well stocked and replenished whenever you wish.  Try the ‘whispering wall’ - if you both stand in opposite corners and talk quietly to the wall, you can hear perfectly - or better still surprise your partner with this knowledge when they are in the toilet :).

The room has an outdoor pool - this is not heated so brace yourself.  But the view from it is perfect.

Our personal experience was quite the adventure even for just 3 nights that we were there.  We had 3 safaris booked and were paired with a very warm and friendly Australian family who we made friends with straight away.  Our Ranger ‘Gayan’ and his driver were absolute diamonds - so helpful and knowledgeable, spotting animals we wouldn’t even with binoculars. Our first trip out was leisurely until they received word of a possible leopard sighting - but it had gone when we got there.  On the way, we saw plenty though and were very happy with our journey.  Our second trip was early morning and we were treated the most magical hour or more when we saw a leopard taking a nap in a tree and watched her for as long as she sat there watching us, licking her paws.  

That night we were held hostage by an elephant who decided that the trees outside our villa were the best in Sri Lanka and we were unable to leave.  So we turned off the lights, made good use of the minibar and sat watching the magnificent beast as he completely ignored the rangers combined attempts to move him on.  We got to dinner about 9.30pm and could not have been happier!  We were treated to the brilliant service they offer none-the-less for our late arrival and the story of the elephant in camp was doing the rounds.  While we were at dinner, he moved on to the staff accommodation and they found themselves unable to go back till he had moved on - I hope they had a ‘lock-in’.  :) and enjoyed it.

Whilst we were there in January and the weather was a little against us with sporadic rain, we made the most of this magical place and the wonderful staff who looked after us.  On the morning that we were leaving, we went on a beach walk with our Ranger and our Antipodean friends and were again treated to the most magical walk on the beach.  We saw the recent prints of Leopard, Elephant, Sloth Bear and mongoose - all of which had travelled through camp during the night - incredible.  The most surprising was the sloth bear and it made up for not having seen him on our safari.  There are a couple of stray dogs here but they really don’t bother you.  

Animals we saw were:- Elephant, Leopoard, Buffalo, Boar, Chipmunks, Peacocks, Monkeys, Monitor Lizards, Gecko, lizards of all sorts, Birds too many to mention and crocodile.",Couples

I got to know him by a friend as the front office manager of the hotel and he did his job perfectly just as my friend told me. Himasha handled our reservations in the hotel arrival and he did his job really well. Talking about the rooms, it was clean and comfortable and the balcony is facing the sea which adds a nice view. They also have a restaurant and a pool in the roof top. We had a buffet for breakfast and set menu's for lunch and dinner. The meals were perfectly prepared and they gave us options to select in the set menu's. I would also like to mention the service provided in the restaurant since thet handled their guests in the best way. I would recommend the hotel to my friends too since the staff is friendly and the service provided was exceptional.

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,5,Culinary excellence in Negombo! Great service,"The wonderful, healthy food, and the great staff make this hotel breakfast buffet superb. 

Too many great people to mention, but Priyangi stands out for her super service, and hardwork. 

I recommend the sweet potato. It's cooked to perfection. 

Instead of using baked beans from a can, the Chef hand cooks black eye peas instead, which are so much better than canned beans. 

The pickled veg is amazing: I eat that all the time. 

You have to visit the Camelot. It's the best in Sri Lankan cuisine and service.

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,3,Nice location,"We recently visited this location for a relaxing day out, and it had the potential to be a wonderful experience. The location itself was beautiful, and the food was great, making it an ideal spot for a laid-back day. However, our experience was unfortunately marred by a few issues with the staff, particularly at the bar.

There was a staff member named Nishantha who, unfortunately, left a negative impression. His manner of speaking to customers was unprofessional, and it felt like he was treating us poorly. We were simply asking for an afternoon snack, but instead of helping, he directed us to different locations and asked us to join a queue for an event hosted by another company. When we followed his instructions, we were then told that we could not get the snack, and were sent back to the bar. This back-and-forth felt confusing and frustrating.

When we tried to explain the situation to Nishantha, his response was dismissive and rude, making us feel as though we were begging for something that should have been a simple request. We were visiting Sri Lanka from the UK, and my sister and her family came all the way from Australia. This visit was meant to be a special memory for us, but the lack of proper training and communication from certain staff members really took away from the experience.

It’s such a shame, because with the right customer service, this could have been a truly wonderful day. We hope the hotel provides more training to its staff on how to properly communicate and treat guests, especially in a place with such a strong reputation.",Family
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,3,Good for 2 nights,"This hotel is in a good location, right on the beach, with beautiful sunsets over the sea.
We stayed for 2 nights after our international flight. It suited our needs but we wouldn't choose it as a destination hotel.
Service was good, pleasant staff and surroundings. The breakfast was ok, the fresh fruit didn't seem that fresh and some of the bread wasn't nice to eat. Not the best breakfast buffet we've ever had.
We had a couple of snacks by the pool during our stay, but they were not brought with napkins (finger foods need napkins).",Couples
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,1,Never Ever again,"This is the hotel I will forever avoid.
I feel sad that I did not go through some of the reviews, due to lack of time , before I book.
I checked in on the 25th February in Camelot Beach for a stay of 3 nights.

Check In: As soon as I arrive at around 16hrs, I was offered to take a seat with a welcoming drink.
My passport was collected for the formalities.
After about 10-15 mins, I was still waiting for someone to come and check me in.
Surprisingly there were no other guests at  Reception, the staff were talking among themselves or looking at he computer.
When I was about to go and enquire if the check in would last long, I saw a bus arriving with about 10 persons.
Immediately, all the staff left their desk to welcome those guests while I was still waiting.
When they went back to their desk I went to see the staff telling them that I`ve been waiting for quite some time now.
Finally, the formalities were completed and was being accompanied to the room after making the full payment for the 3 nights.

Room: No seaview from inside, you have to go the balcony to see the view.
When I asked the staff who accompanied me for a better seaview and a double bed instead of 2 single beds, I was told that the hotel is full and it was not possible but to check the next morning.
I was not only shocked by this answer because for a hotel which claims to be top notch , I would have expected an answer like "" I will check and revert back to you shortly""
Then I remembered that some hotels will only take your money irrespective of offering the service you have paid for.
Some hours ago, 2 of my friends called me from Hikkaduwa and wanted to come to Negombo for about 6 nights. I told them that the hotel is full here and that they would rather book another hotel.
They started laughing, there were about 6 rooms available on Booking.Com, which means that there were also some other rooms available for direct bookings!
How can people lie to that extent? This attitude prevents the resort from selling the rooms because of the staff.
The owner should look into asap it as I do not trust the management over there to do something.
Dinner: Went to the main restaurant for dinner. After going around the buffet, I asked one of the Chefs if I could order form A La Carte , the buffet was limited in terms of vegetarian options.
He said ok , asked me to go and have  a seat while he will bring over the menu.
I waited and waited, neither the Chef nor the menu came. Both were no shows. 
Finally I had to ask a waiter if he could assist me, which he kindly did by bringing me the menu and  taking my order.
BTW, I saw the same  Chef in the restaurant during breakfast, he tried to avoid all eye contact with me. 

Before going to breakfast, I went down to Reception to inform them I would upgrade my meal plan to Bed and Breakfast at US D 10 per day for the 3 days.
However, the Front Office Manager who by the way does not have any sense of customer service came in and rudely said that the hotel will apply a higher price (around US D 15) which I declined since it was written black on white USD 10 per night per day.
I even showed him screen shot of that. The only thing he could do is to take leave instead of sorting out the situation.
I am sure a line staff could do better than him.
He said in that case, I would better talk to the GM. I said Ok, please call him or her. Surprisingly, she was in a meeting. 
I was told that she would contact me later.
I waited in vain.
Finally, I went out for a trip and came back at  16h30.

I took the decision to leave this hotel after only 1 night despite having already paid for 3 nights.
I wanted to have peace and stay in a serene place. W

When checking out from that resort, surprisingly everybody started to feel concerned (Receptionist to the Front Office Manager).
I told them I was leaving due to the appalling service that they deliver.

One advice to the Management or owners: Please send your staff to have proper training in hotels like The Kingsbury`s  in Colombo or Jetwing Sea which is not far from where you are situated.

Be careful while booking this hotel. Personally, I will never go again and recommend.",Solo
Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,4,"Beautiful Stay with Scenic Views, Warm Welcome & Great Activities","We stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was truly a memorable experience. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed with a traditional pooja-style greeting that made us feel special. The hotel also surprised us with a lovely honeymoon cake , which was such a thoughtful gesture and made our stay even more meaningful.

The view from the property is absolutely breathtaking — peaceful and serene. It’s also a great location for adventure lovers, with hiking to Little Adam’s Peak nearby, plus a swing and zipline experience right next to the hotel.

All the staff were friendly and helpful, and even during our departure, the hospitality was excellent. However, we did face a small issue with the shuttle service for dinner. Despite calling in advance as instructed, the shuttle was not sent. After waiting, we had to walk. I reported the issue to the manager, who kindly assured me that they are working to improve their standards and ensure this doesn’t happen again.

Aside from that, everything was wonderful — peaceful surroundings, warm service, and special moments. Highly recommend for couples and nature lovers alike. Looking forward to visiting again!",Couples

The highlights for us were the food and the spa. They offer a really good selection of Sri Lankan cuisine—elevated just enough to feel special, but still authentic and full of Sri Lankan hospitality. It’s also reasonably priced. If you’re not in the mood for Sri Lankan food, their Western options are also excellent. I recommend the Eggs Benedict.

The spa area has beautiful views, and it’s a lovely place to relax while being pampered. Again, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the experience.

Suggestions for the hotel: It would be great if the hotel offered some excursions in their brochure, like private tours to nearby waterfalls or small adventures to make the most of the area.

Overall, I can’t wait to come back again.",Couples

As we were there on our honeymoon we also had a complimentary small marriage ceremony and some other extra touches which were lovely. 

The hotel is not far from the centre of Ella, which is easily accessed by tuktuk. Beach club, zip line and Nine Arch bridge are all walking distance which was really handy. Hotel does a guided walk to Little Adams Peak every morning for sunrise which was beautiful and only around 20 minutes.

We had an unforgettable honeymoon at 98 Acres Resort & Spa. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality stood out. The staff greeted us with a traditional ""Aarathi"" ceremony, setting a serene tone for our stay.

We chose the Royal Deluxe Cabana on a bed and breakfast basis. The accommodation was a blend of rustic charm and modern comfort, featuring eco-friendly designs with thatched roofs and furniture. The balcony offered panoramic views of the lush tea plantations and the majestic Little Adam’s Peak and Ella rock. 

A highlight of our stay was the complimentary sunrise tour arranged by the hotel. Accompanied by a knowledgeable guide, we trekked to the top of Little Adam’s Peak. The sight of the sun rising over the misty mountains was truly magical—a moment we'll cherish forever.

Dining at Restaurant 98 was a delight. We enjoyed a diverse breakfast buffet with both Western and Sri Lankan dishes, including the must-try egg hoppers. The setting, overlooking the verdant landscape, made each meal special.",Couples

From the moment we arrived he had the kids smiling and from sun up to sun down they were entertained with creative arts, board games in the games rooms, themed adventures and outdoor play including cricket and volleyball. 
Every day the kids came back with huge smiles each day full of stories, smiles, and excitement. 

The activities were thoughtfully planned and age-appropriate, balancing creativity, learning, and fun perfectly and we loved that it included many local childhood games that Rutchira played as a child.  

His energy, smile, warmth and genuine care for the children was immediately apparent. He went above and beyond to create a safe, engaging, and joy-filled environment where every child felt special and included.

If you have children and are looking for somewhere to go as a family then I highly recommend recommend this resort as Rutchira will make you feel like family.

The rest of the staff were incredible also.  The rooms were cleaned each morning with great care and fresh water supplied at a call whenever we needed it.

Pasikuda,Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa - Thema Collection,5,5 Stars – Absolutely Recommended!,"A fantastic hotel in a dreamlike location! The pool with a view of the sea is absolutely breathtaking, the entire resort is beautifully maintained, and the beach is clean and stunning.

The staff were consistently warm and helpful – especially Ruchi, who gave our children an unforgettable experience. He lovingly crafted flower crowns with them, and together they even built a miniature ""Maalu Maalu Hotel"" using natural materials. Truly heartwarming!

The food was excellent, especially the buffet, offering a delicious mix of international and local cuisine. Breakfast and dinner were definite highlights – sometimes accompanied by a violinist, which created a special atmosphere.

A perfect place for families to relax, enjoy nature, and feel completely taken care of. We will definitely be back!",Family

 What an amazing hotel. Can't say how much we enjoyed our 7 day stay here. It was our 30th wedding anniversary.
All staff were so helpful,and attentive, they went above and beyond.
 When we arrived we virtually had the pool and beach to ourselves. We walked the bay both ways. A huge plus point is there are no beach sellers.
 The three hour snorkelling trip was excellent value for money  organised via the hotel. My husband went on the bike tour,which he thoroughly enjoyed.
The spa was  great . Third time in Sr Lanka, and I can honestly say I will return to this hotel.

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,4,"Relatively good experience however, service needs improvement","We stayed at the Weligama Bay Marriot in April 2025. Overall, the stay was good with good facilities. However, the service was poor. The hotel was big and felt very impersonal compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip to Sri-Lanka such as Jetwing Surf, Heritance Kandalama, Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa. 
Of note was check-in and the provision on tea bags during the breakfast buffet. 
Check-in was a nightmare; there was no one directing our party to a check-in counter nor was there an area resembling a check-in counter. It looked more like a fish market, crowded with people. We had to move across to different ""desks"" 3x times to get someone to attend to us as people kept pushing through. A trolley of welcome drinks was brought, presumably for us however, a group of people walking past grabbed them.

Sri-Lanka has great tea and all other hotels we stayed at provided freshly brewed pots of delicious tea during the breakfast service. At Weligama however, a tea bag was offered with hot water. There were 2 staff members at the tea/coffee station however, I could not figure out exactly why they needed 2x staff members to provide tea bags and bad coffee. If these aspects could be improved this could be a more welcoming hotel.",Family
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Simply exceptional,"From the moment we checked in, the experience at Marriott Weligama was nothing short of exceptional. Iresh’s warm and attentive manner immediately set the tone, with a special touch in recognizing our Marriott Bonvoy status. Lochana, at the front desk, made sure we were always updated on daily events, adding a personal touch that enhanced our stay.

Now, let’s talk about the food—simply outstanding! The Sri Lankan dishes were bursting with flavor, from the vibrant sambol to the deliciously varied vegetable accompaniments. Whether you’re craving traditional Sri Lankan flavors or international cuisine, this hotel caters to all. The spread includes a fantastic Chinese-Asian station, an Indian station, and a pan-European station. It’s clear that the hotel’s culinary team is focused on providing a diverse, high-quality experience that meets nearly every guest’s needs.

The hotel’s beach is another highlight, renowned for its prime surfing conditions. Weligama’s beach is perfect for beginner surfers, and it offers plenty of other activities. Even if the food at the hotel could become repetitive for some, it absolutely doesn’t here. There’s always something new to try, and the quality remains top-notch throughout our stay.

If I were to pick a minor gripe, it would be the inconsistency in offers between the lobby outlet and poolside outlets. A little uniformity across the board could help boost revenue, but this is a very minor issue in an otherwise stellar stay.

A big thank you to Marriott Weligama for delivering a remarkable experience. The hotel truly lives up to the Marriott Bonvoy brand. Special thanks to Iresh, Lochana at reception, and the amazing Nazmi and Dushan at the restaurant who went above and beyond to make our stay extraordinary. And of course, the views from the seafront rooms are absolutely breathtaking!

Highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area—truly a gem!",Family
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,2,Disappointing Stay So Far - Poor Service and Unwelcoming Atmosphere,"I rarely write negative reviews (have a look at my review history), but our current experience at this hotel is so disappointing and unacceptable!

From the moment we arrived, it was clear that we weren't going to receive the same treatment as other guests. While everyone else checking in was warmly welcomed with refreshing beverages, we weren't even offered water. We waited 3 hours for our room and had to purchase overpriced drinks and food from the hotel during our wait. The service during our 3 hours of waiting was painfully slow and the staff forgot almost every order (a drink each - 4 people, and 3 simple meals) 

Although we had requested an early check-in months in advance, we only discovered upon arrival that this couldn't be accommodated, which I understand can happen. However, what was unacceptable was the complete lack of basic hospitality, respect and information - no welcome,  no offer of welcome drinks being passed around to other guests right in front of us, no offer of water, no information about breakfast times or hotel services. 

I must mention that they were EXTREMELY quick and efficient with making us pay upfront before any kind of room was available (and still hadn’t even been offered a sip of water). 

I brought it up to a few staff members during our wait for our rooms, including while the welcome drinks were being passed around to others, but I was dismissed with an “ah sorry about that” but still no offer of water even! The rudeness was disgraceful! 

When our room was finally ready, our bags were delivered to our friends' room instead of ours, forcing us to transport them across to our room ourselves.

The problems continued at breakfast when our ordered omelettes were given to another table. Throughout our stay so far, everything is overpriced for the quality received, and the unacceptable rudeness is continuing. 

The most frustrating aspect is the manager's behaviour. He was incredibly rude, consistently spoke over me when I tried to address our concerns, and later seemed to ""disappear"" despite multiple requests to speak with him. Zero apologies were offered for any of these issues or inconveniences we’ve faced so far.

While I can understand that early check-in requests can't always be accommodated, the rudeness from senior staff was completely unacceptable. 

For the price point of this hotel, so far the service is falling FAR below expectations. Usually we would spend a lot of time at the hotel, use the spa services, eat at the restaurants, and get the majority of our drinks from the hotel bars. I will not spend any extra money at this place right now. Us and our friends are making a point to eat and drink elsewhere, as well as use spas not associated with the hotel during our current visit. 

I wouldn't stay here again and cannot recommend it to others based on our experience. There are far better hotels close by.",Friends

Marriott needs to train their staff better, optimise their processes so that at peak check in hours, people aren’t left waiting for over thirty minutes in a side lounge.

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Vegetarians Be Careful serious issue of Food Mislabelling.,"Food Mislabelling. Vegetarians be careful.

I recently stayed at Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa from 27th January to 30th January 2025 excellent property & stay was very good only thing what was disappointing was we experienced serious issues regarding food mislabelling. As strict vegetarians (no eggs, meat, or fish), we trust reputed hospitality brands to maintain the highest standards, but our experience was deeply disappointing.

1. Mislabelling of Thai Curry as Vegetarian

On the day of check-in, we ordered food through in-room dining. My daughter explicitly informed the staff that we are strict vegetarians and requested Vegetarian Thai Curry with Rice.

The staff initially mentioned that the Thai Curry contained prawn sauce. However, a senior staff member later confirmed this after escalation.

That evening, at Weligama Kitchen, we noticed the same Thai Curry incorrectly labelled as Vegetarian. When my daughter questioned the chef, he confirmed it contained prawn sauce and admitted it was a mistake after consulting another chef.

2. Egg Used in 'Vegetarian' Hopper (Appam)

On 30th January, during breakfast, I requested a Vegetarian Hopper. The chef responded, ""No Veg,"" and demonstrated by showing me an egg, stating that eggs are used in the dough.

Despite this, the dish was labelled as Vegetarian. When I took a photo of the name card, the chef panicked and called Chef Murtuza, who tried to dismiss the situation as a ""miscommunication."" However, given the chef’s direct statement and demonstration, this was not a miscommunication but clear mislabelling.

We are strict vegetarians, and this misinformation is not only misleading but deeply offensive to our religious beliefs.
My daughter has severe allergies, and such mistakes could have led to serious health complications.

The casual attitude of the staff over three days raises serious concerns about whether the vegetarian food served was genuinely vegetarian.

We chose Marriott expecting the highest hospitality standards, but this experience has been extremely disappointing. We request:

1. Immediate corrective action to ensure vegetarian food is properly labelled and prepared separately.

2. Proper staff training to prevent such serious mistakes in the future.

Mislabelling of Food was disappointing, I would like to appreciate Chef Naveen, Chef Ruvini, and Nazmi for their excellent service and attentiveness.

Additionally, I would like to caution vegetarians traveling to Sri Lanka—please be careful. It is essential to speak directly with a chef who understands proper English and clearly state No Egg, Fish, or Meat to ensure food is genuinely vegetarian.",Family

Spectacular location, large rooms with character, good food, helpful staff - all positive. However, we were unlucky. One evening, returning to our room after dinner, we found bats flying around inside. Staff were helpful in removing them, but they soon found their way back in. Staff came three times to remove them and to try to block up where they were coming in - they were great - but I was still up at 3.30pm getting bats out of the room myself. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked and we could only change rooms the following day. I accept these things happen. What didn't impress me, however, was the attitude of the general manager, who showed virtually no sympathy and empathy. He made light of the matter, almost laughing it off. There was no gesture of goodwill, financial or otherwise. Having slept only two hours that night, we were obviously exhausted for the next few days and it took the edge off our trip.

The staff was happy to give me as much food as I wanted and to taste and have small bites, could modify orders as I liked. I highly recommend this place for a true getaway into nature, away from city life. The naturalist Ashan was super genuine, knowledgeable and helpful about all sightseeing and nature excursions in Trincomalee and across Sri Lanka. He even helped me plan the rest of my trip moving to other cities. I arrived by cinnamon air from Colombo to Trincomalee airport which was super easy and fun, and Uga hotel sent me a driver to pick me up from the landing strip and take me to the hotel. There are lovely beaches, snorkeling and temples in the area which the hotel took me to, including seeing lots of amazing dolphins, turtles, colorful corals and fish.

Kuchchaveli,Uga Jungle Beach,5,Idyllic beach resort with exceptional food and staff,"Review

We had an incredible stay at Uga Jungle Beach for my 30th birthday. We stayed for 5 nights and the stay can be surmised into 3 points: exceptional service, exceptional food, premium feel.

The staff were all extremely friendly and no request was too difficult to sort. They work long hours and maintain the high quality consistently. A good example of their forward thinking was to do the room cleaning whilst you’re at breakfast and dinner so you don’t have the awkward moment returning to your room to find someone midway through cleaning!

We were half board and experienced a la carte dining. For each of our 5 days we had a different menu for a 5 course dinner (starter, soup, sorbet, entree, desert). Dishes were superbly prepared and presented and tasted superb. Breakfast was also an a la carte experience with juice options, 3 different dishes out of a large menu (we only ever had 2 as they were very filling).

On my birthday my wife surprised me with a sunset seafood bbq on the beach, organised by Uga. This was the main highlight of the holiday for me - the food was exceptional, both in quality and quantity (tuna, crab, lobster, prawns, cuttlefish, white fish, vegetables, rice etc) - we even got a private fire pit! They put lots of effort into the sand decorations too.

Only minor thing was the drinks were on the pricier end but that’s to be expected when travelling to a premium hotel. As a reference a lion lager (330ml) was around £5. We have been to restaurants / hotels where a 625ml bottle was £2. By UK prices £5 is still good. Be aware the menu prices are listed in USD - there is then a service charge (10%) and local tax (18-20%) on top of the listed price. At the time of writing this, the conversion to GBP means the listed price is basically what it costs in GBP when you add the service + tax.

We also chose to go on a guided cycling tour (3 hours - £32) with a private naturalist - this was around 20km and involved seeing many of the 400+ bird species in Sri Lanka (thanks Ashan!). If you like nature and the beautiful rice field landscapes then this excursion is a must do in our opinion.

On site itself there are so many varieties of wildlife - monkeys regularly sat above our balcony (Jungle cabin). We also do giant squirrels, crabs, 3 different species of kingfisher, loads of other birds.  

The beach is completely idyllic, we ran 2km either side and didn’t encounter another human being - it is fully secluded. The water is beautiful, calm, warm and there is a lifeguard on duty. We found that the water remained chest height up to around 15-20 meters from the shore so was ideal for paddling and swimming.

We hope to return in the future - thanks for the amazing stay.",Couples

The housekeeping staff were on point.

Negombo,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,5,Regal Réseau – Where Every Detail Feels Like Home,"Review of Regal Réseau – An Unforgettable Experience!

We stayed at Regal Réseau and the experience exceeded all expectations! From the very first moment, we felt we had arrived at a place where service, cleanliness, attentiveness, and atmosphere are of the highest standard.

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the amazing team who did everything to make us feel at home:
Chef Sunil – for the delicious, diverse food and attention to every detail. Every meal was a celebration!
Kushan at the front desk – from the very first moment, he made it his mission to ensure we felt comfortable and welcomed. Throughout our entire stay, he offered warm, personal, and attentive care. Every request was met with sensitivity, respect, and a genuine desire to help.
Bositha from the management office – for his professionalism, kindness, and willingness to assist at any time and with any request.
Pushpita, the wonderful masseuse – truly relaxing, professional, and personalized treatment.
Dominic, Damindu, and all the lovely guys from the restaurant – always with a smile, warm service, and great hospitality.

The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, comfortable, and tastefully designed. The rooftop view is breathtaking, and the overall atmosphere is just perfect.

A heartfelt thank you to the entire team – you made this vacation unforgettable.
We’ll gladly come back – and highly recommend Regal Réseau to anyone looking for a truly high-quality hospitality experience!",Friends

Negombo,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,4,"Good Deal, Happy Stay","I recently stayed at this hotel and had a great experience overall. The room was spacious and comfortable, although the bathroom needed some maintenance attention.

We didn't get the room with a sea view, but the rate we paid (around USD60+ with breakfast) was a fantastic deal. The breakfast spread was impressive, with a good variety of options like fresh omelets, hoppers, waffles, and strong coffee.

The hotel's bar offered stunning sea views, and we enjoyed cocktails there in the evening. The staff were friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to assist with some travel inconveniences.

Despite a few minor issues, I'd definitely recommend this hotel for its great value, delicious breakfast, and excellent service.",Couples

Anyway they rustled up a 3rd bed but took them to 3pm that day to turn up with a 3rd towel. Hardly 4 star experience. The good bit is the amazing roof top pool, restaurant and restaurant staff.

Beautiful view but unfortunately it's loud at night. Aircon loud and the DJ who plays almost every night is extremely loud. We walked into the hotel to grab our room key with a couple infront of us complaining of the noise. It's LOUD. Being jet lagged , helped us, pass out.

Negombo,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,1,Disappointing Experience – Locals Beware,"Disappointing Experience – Locals Beware
We had a frustrating experience at this establishment, and we strongly advise locals to think twice before booking. Despite making a reservation weeks in advance and paying a 50% deposit, we faced a delayed check-in by over an hour, while foreign guests were accommodated without any issues.

The pool situation was completely unfair—we were told it was at capacity, but foreign guests were freely allowed in. When we agreed to return later in the evening, we found that chlorine had been added early, shutting down access before the official closing time of 8 PM. It was evident they didn’t expect foreigners to swim after sunset and adjusted the rules accordingly.
Another example of discrimination was the pool towel policy—foreign guests had no trouble taking towels to their rooms, but when we did the same, we were denied. Oddly enough, the policy changed overnight after we complained.
When we raised our concerns, instead of taking accountability, the executive chef attempted to pacify us with complimentary items, as if free food would make up for the poor service and discriminatory treatment. Management later offered a 50% refund, which we declined—we weren’t looking for compensation, just fair and equal treatment.
Aside from these issues, room service was slow, responses were delayed, and overall, it was clear that local guests were not given the same priority as foreign visitors. Even the cocktails from the pool bar were disappointing—overpriced and poorly made.
While the rooms were clean and the food was decent, the overall service, treatment, and management approach were unacceptable. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for a fair and welcoming experience.

I would like to address the false statement made by the hotel management and Mr. :Jayashan ""It seems there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the 50% discount, as you mentioned you refused it, but our records indicate you accepted it. Was only charged 50% of the room amount.""

The truth is that Mr. Jayasan and his hotel management team offered us a 50% discount after several issues arose during our stay, which I explicitly rejected. Additionally, before leaving, we had cocktails at the rooftop bar and settled that bill separately. If the hotel claims we accepted the discount, it is a clear example of how locals are treated unfairly by this establishment. The hotel management's public misrepresentation of the facts is deeply concerning and indicates a lack of respect for local guests.",Friends

Golf buggies whisk you from room to reception although it’s fine to walk during the daytime.  
We were assigned a butler who was always on hand and couldn’t do enough for us - the mini bar miniature wines didn’t quite cut it and appreciated the full size bottle exchange!
The chef needs special mention. Incredible food and very grateful to him for the curry cooking lesson. The blackened curries are superb. 
Drinks on the beach were a special treat at sunset (although a wandering elephant prevented this on night 2!) 
Special mention also for grilled lobster dish 
The general manager always attentive and friendly making sure everything just right. 
Rangers are very knowledgeable - ours qualified in S Africa
The safari drive also very well organised in excellent Toyota go anywhere vehicle - leopard eventually seen after much deep jungle road exploring ! The hotel even pays for “fast track” 
Any criticism ? Only one very minor- the all inclusive wine only just acceptable. For an extra £5-£10 a bottle purchase price could improve this as did let down the meal slightly. Think cloudy bay standard to really up the game

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,"Top class service and facilities, underrated gem in Marriott group","As a Marriott Titanium Member staying for >650 nights in different Marriott properties, this is easily a top 5 pick globally. 

I don’t normally write Tripadvisor reviews, having said it’s for a Marriott property because they already have their own comment and review system in their app. What’s more - unlike some Marriott properties where they would chase for Tripadvisor reviews, Marriott Weligama did not do so, so this is simply voluntarily.

This time I think the team really deserves a special mention and extra review so they can be seen. I’m very impressed by how this team, from all angles, have taken this to another level of attentiveness to serve every single guest at the hotel.

Starting from 1 week before check-in, Taneesha from the travel desk has already started contacting me to offer different options for daily activities. Despite several changes and special requirements, she was very professional and tried to cater for everything needed.

During check-in, the desk has spent a long time to explain all my questions, and eventually introduced me to Nishadi, which she would help to answer all my questions tirelessly, from food choices to spa booking, and even after I departed, she still took care of my requests (lost clothing in the room) and made sure I’m well taken care of. Special kudos to Nishadi!

At the restaurant (Wave), although I can’t remember their names, the waiters have been very attentive to our needs. When I was having crab during lunch, having seen I was taking off shells by hand, the waiters offered lime water and wet towels at the moment when I needed the most (and I didn’t even request for it). I’m impressed by their attentiveness.

During checkout, big thanks to Pathium who helped me to sort out my bills when I had some miscommunication with the spa team, as well as payment problems. We ended sorted the issue out, but he has tried his best to help sort out everything needed to make sure I was happy about it, even when it meant he needed to take extra time to sort out the problems despite there’s an easy way out.

For all the other aspects of the hotel, rooms have been amazing (clean, well stocked with water, good amenities, very well maintained), view was great (facing the sea, good vibes), location is not bad (4 minutes next to Weligama train station, city center is nearby).

In conclusion, I think Marriott Weligama’s service is a surprising find, and I don’t see this even in top Marriott properties globally. Having said, the extra care that staff paid and extra steps they have made, have definitely impressed me and I’d very recommend everyone to try out in this hotel when they visit Sri Lanka.",Couples

Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,"Dated property, but nice views, well laid out and excellent staff","This review covers a 2 night stay in mid-December 2024 by a family with 2 young kids in a standard room which was booked using Marriott points.

LOCATION: the hotel is centrally located in Weligama with a number of shops and local restaurants within walking distance or a short tuk tuk ride away. There are also 3 beach clubs right next door. The location is certainly an advantage versus a lot of other beach resorts in Sri Lanka which are often quite isolated. Weligama itself is also quite a buzzy little town.

STANDARD ROOM: a spacious entry level room at 46m, albeit it felt a bit dated. It was generally well appointed but I wouldn’t call it particularly luxurious. The best part was definitely the ocean view. We were on the 10th floor (the highest in the resort) and the views were pretty special especially at sunset time. On that note, it is worth checking out the hotel’s rooftop to get the best of the views.

POOL: the hotel has two main swimming pools which are side by side, both similar in design but with respective depths of 90cm and 120cm. There is also a separate water slide feeding into a tiny third pool. It was an ideal setup as quite a compact area which allowed us parents to sit in our loungers, while having eyes on the kids as they rotated between the two pools as well as the water slide. The pools were also heated to a comfortable temperature. The water slide was basic but high speed, and the kids really enjoyed this. The music and saxophone player created a bit of a nice vibe at the pool in the late afternoons.

BEACH: just a few steps away from the pool is the beachfront. It is a public beach hence there are no sun loungers or hotel service once out there, plus there are quite a few scalpers around selling surfing lessons and water sports. The beach itself is pretty decent though – for Sri Lankan standards – with soft sand, a gentle decline and no rocks or other debris. The waves are moderately strong and constant supervision was required for our younger aged kids, but they did love being thrown around in the water.

OTHER FACILITIES: right next to the pools there are a couple of ping pong tables, a foosball table, a pool table plus a sad looking kids club that caters more to babies/toddlers. What was very much of interest to our older kid was the newly opened video games room. This housed a PS5 on a huge projector screen, an arcade style driving game, plus a couple of other things. Note these items were chargeable but not that expensive ($5 for 30 min on the PS5).

FOOD: we had both breakfasts, one buffet lunch and one poolside lunch at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to get free breakfast on a points booking (not the norm). The food was generally decent. There was a wide selection at the buffets, while our poolside lunch was enjoyable.

SERVICE: I have become accustomed to slow, often disorganised service on my trips to Sri Lanka, and was pleasantly surprised to see very efficient service at this resort. Staff here have clearly been well trained. Check-in was very friendly, and we were given a WhatsApp contact number through which any requests were attended to speedily. For example, a local restaurant booking request was sorted within a minute of me asking. Poolside food and drinks service was also above average. The service aspect certainly enhanced our overall experience at the hotel.

PRICES: I haven’t noted specific prices down, but to give an example we spent around 24k rupees (£65) for an entire day at the pool, including lunch for the 4 of us and a couple of cocktails/juices. Within reason I would say.

CONCLUSION: I was very pleased with my stay at the Weligama Marriott. While not the most luxurious of properties, the prime location, nice pool and beach, generally compact layout, beautiful views and excellent service all came together to leave me with a very positive view, and I would certainly consider returning in future. In my view this property is miles ahead of the only other Marriott beach resort in Sri Lanka (the Sheraton Kosgoda).",Family
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Amazing place - we would definitely go back,"This is an amazing hotel right on the beach of Welligama.  We really enjoyed Welligama Beach itself--- very clean, not too crowded, great place for swimming.  And the Marriott made our experience exceptional.  The food was amazing, the service was great.  All the rooms look over the ocean--- it is one of those ""wow"" experiences when you walk into the room and see the view.  Definitely worth staying here--- quiet, comfortable and everything we expect from the Marriott.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,2,Poorly managed,"This hotel has great location but the hotel needs remodelling. The service was mediocre. I got two hour massage which was pricey, the horrible sewage smell from the pipes in the Massage room was extremely overwhelming and negatively impacted the experience. That shows poor management that they either have to do something about it or be transparent and let the guest know before booking a massage. Which was not the case. You can definitely see the lack of attention to details in every corner of this Marriott.",Solo
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Great Beach holiday,"Beautiful hotel in a gorgeous strip of beach. The rooms we got were spacious and faced the seaside with huge windows to take in the views. 
The food was good with a pretty good variety.

My highlight of the stay was the coconut body scrub I had at the spa - so relaxing.

The beach is quite popular for surfing - so if a quiet beach is what you’re looking for, then you’re unlikely to get that. Having said that, it’s great for swimming as it’s pretty shallow.",Family
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,4,"Lovely room, great staff, outstanding breakfast, but some key issues","Positives
- our room was spacious and well-designed, comfortable bed, great balcony
- breakfast buffet was really good
- staff were helpful and very pleasant
- both food and service at the New Year’s Eve banquet buffet were outstanding, and a great effort on the room decor and the general organisation. 

Negatives
- everything we got through the hotel was ridiculously expensive: drive to Mirissa (for an outing organised by the hotel) was USD80 round trip, which is extortionate. Same for airport transfer - we were quoted a huge additional cost in USD. Etc. 
- the New Year’s Eve banquet, which should have been a fantastic event, was ruined by the excessively loud music during the meal. Louder does not equal better. You cannot have a convivial meal if the amps - many of which actually touched the tables - are turned up to club night level and your teeth are vibrating with the bass. People could not hear themselves speak, let alone attempt to strike up a conversation with their fellow guests. Little children  were screaming, but their parents could not tell unless they were looking directly at them! We ate (the wonderful food) quickly and left early, as did many others. If the music had gone to club level at 11pm, fine. But not 8pm or 9pm. Such a shame, as the band was really good. The Marriott management needs to take a look at its guests: they are not students attending a rave in a warehouse.",Family
Weligama,Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa,5,Great hotel.,"Excellent hotel. 

Service outstanding, employees very nice and always responsive.

Room beautiful with everything you need, nice bathroom and great views of the ocean.

Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,5,A Dream Escape in Ella – Unforgettable Stay at 98 Acres Resort & Spa,"From the moment we booked to the day we checked out, 98 Acres Resort & Spa offered an exceptional and seamless hospitality experience that exceeded all expectations.

Reservation Experience:
We took advantage of a special Room Rush offer and booked a Suite Room directly through their website — a fast, intuitive, and convenient process. What truly impressed us was the thoughtful follow-up. A day before our scheduled stay, the hotel sent a personalized reminder email — a first for me with any hotel, and it genuinely saved the day as I had completely forgotten the date!

Getting There:
We drove from Colombo via Beragala–Wellawaya–Ella route, which took about 5 hours. The scenic journey itself was a treat — filled with lush greenery, waterfalls, and mountain views that set the tone for what was to come.

Arrival & Check-In:
We arrived at 2:00 PM and were warmly welcomed by the smiling staff with a traditional blessing and a refreshing iced tea. The check-in process was swift (just 5 minutes), and we were chauffeured to our suite in an eco-friendly electric buggy.

Personal Butler Service:
Our butler, Mr. Haridharan, was exceptional — offering a full room tour, explaining all facilities, dining options, and activities around the resort. His attention to detail made us feel genuinely cared for throughout the stay.

Exclusive Offers:
Upon check-in, we received 15% off at the Ravana Pool Club and 10% off on the nearby Mega Zip Line adventure — an unexpected bonus!

Dining & Culinary Experience:
Dinner was a delight, enjoyed in our room with a golden sunset view of Mini Adam’s Peak and Ella Rock. Their à la carte menu features both Sri Lankan and Western options. Every dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and served in generous portions.

The Main Restaurant is just a two-minute walk — spacious, ambient, and operated by highly professional staff. The bar offers a wide selection of beverages including exclusive 98 Acres cocktails. We highly recommend trying their signature drink called “Pickle” — a unique, refreshing cocktail experience.

Unmatched Views & Ambience:
Every villa is strategically designed to face breathtaking views of Ella Rock and Mini Adam’s Peak. Sunrise was absolutely magical. If you’re into stargazing, this is the place — the night sky revealed a million stars, a rare sight for city dwellers.

Facilities & Activities:

The Mini Bar was well-stocked (chargeable)

Gym and spa services are must-try

ATV rides, zip lining, skywalks, abseiling, and more at the Ravana Adventure Zone, just a short hotel shuttle ride away

GoPro and drone video options are available at very reasonable rates (bring your ID or driver’s license)

The Halpe Tea shop on-site offers the finest Ceylon teas to take home

Service & Staff:
The staff — from housekeeping to the executive team — are impeccably trained, respectful, and proactive. Their warm hospitality reflects true Sri Lankan charm and professionalism.

Unique Touches:
As a final gesture, guests are blessed according to their faith before departure — a thoughtful spiritual send-off. We were also gifted a complimentary pack of Halpe tea.

---

Final Verdict:
98 Acres Resort & Spa is not just a hotel — it's an experience. With top-tier service, stunning scenery, mouthwatering cuisine, and well-curated activities, it is undoubtedly one of the best resorts I’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended for both locals and international travelers.
A solid 5-star experience.",Family
Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,3,Nice property with more misses than hits!,"To start off, the pluses - beautiful property, spacious rooms and well intentioned staff. The rooms overlook the tea estate and has a gorgeous view of the estates and a huge balcony to enjoy it. We stayed in a premium signature room. The food, service staff at restaurant were solid..so was the breakfast.

Now for the not so good - there was a rain shower which knocked down the internet, phone and TV! Which meant, there was no way to connect with the lobby or get help. We were passed from person to person and spent 530-730 pm fixing the issues, which left us all with a headache. Problem was not the issue but the fact that nobody took responsibility to fix it, nor did we get an eta on when it will be fixed. 

Second, there are a lot of fixable issues - no sign boards on property, understaffed which meant no buggy service post 10 pm and before 6:30 am! No public telephones (everything was IP phones). 

The swimming pool is down for renovation and they give access to Ravana pool, but it’s not a place for kids (hikers come to Ravana pool to get drunk and hang in the pool). Also the buggy cannot reach Ravana due to poor roads! So it’s not really a replacement pool. 

So overall, would I recommend? At this price (500 usd a night), not really. At that price and in Sri Lanka, I would expect top notch service that did not happen. The front office manager did his best to assuage with a small discount but that doesn’t cut it for a supposedly 5 star property.",Family
Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,5,Bliss,Hotel is wonderful and especially loved the spa - we had massages and facials with a backdrop over the mountains. The room was beautiful and clean and service was very attentive. We have loved our stay and would be back in a heartbeat. Thank you!,Friends
Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,5,A beautiful hotel with magical views.,"This was absolutely my favourite hotel in Sri Lanka and would stay again in a heart beat. The location was beautiful, and the hotel is simply gorgeous. We arrived on a clear sunny day and the views from the reception area were simply breath taking. Our room was exquisite, it was large and spacious, immaculately clean, beautifully decorated and the views were incredible, we could see the whole valley and little Adam’s Peak. The restaurant was again beautiful and the staff were extremely polite and attentive. 
The hotel is a short walk from Ella and the nine arches bridge, making it the perfect location for your stay exploring Ella and the surrounding area. One morning we joined the ranger and walked to Little Adam’s Peak, approximately 15/20 mins from the hotel and well worth the early morning wake up call, the views were incredible. If you are looking to stay in Ella, look no further, this hotel is magical and the staff are very special too. Thank you 98 Acres for making our stay so perfect in every way, and we very much look forward to returning one day.",Couples

Ella,98 Acres Resort & Spa,5,An amazing place to stay in Ella,"This was a beautiful find in Ella. We hired a driver (Randika from SeeLanka Tours) and he came to collect us in Colombo from our hotel, and drove us to 98 Acres in Ella. We even saw a wild elephant on the side of the road, and visited a beautiful waterfall along the way. So even the drive to Ella (which took 5 hours along the southern expressway) was fascinating. 

Once we arrived in Ella, we were so grateful to have chosen 98 Acres. We had a beautiful room that overlooked nature. We even had a peacock come and sit on our verandah on the final morning before we checked out. He was completely at ease, chilling there for at least 2 hours, giving us a chance to carefully take some pics without scaring him off. 

The staff were amazing - absolutely 10/10 in their friendliness and helpfulness. The food was spectacular, and the chef went to such great lengths to ensure we had food that was within our dietary requirements (gluten free for me). And the place is so unique and with such spectacular views over Little Adams Peak and Ella Rock. Every day provided such wonderful opportunities for photographs. 

There were a few minor things I noticed which weren't 5/5: 

1. The glass for the shower doesn't extend to the wall, so every time we used the shower, water splashed over the toilet. 
2. We did hear the noise of the buggies (vehicles which carry guests around the property) from our room, and because we had the top floor of the villa and another couple had the lower floor, there was some noise transfer (we could hear them talking). I ended up using ear plugs the first night, but didn't need them the second night. 
3. We had an Ayurvedic 1 hour massage at the Spa on site, but neither of us were impressed with our therapists. My friend and I are both trained in Ayurvedic massage and we both teach massage. If I visited again, I would find a massage clinic off-site where I can get a proper Ayurvedic massage. The upside was that the view and environs of the Spa on site at 98 Acres was stunning, so we got some great pics for facebook and Instagram.",Friends

Excellent breakfast and good buffet dinner. Very nice view of the beach and sea. Can greatly recommend this hotel,Couples
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,4,A fabulous hotel,"This was our 6th trip to Sri Lanka and our first time staying at Camelot Beach.
We initially stayed for 2 nights prior to going on our travels. 
ROOMS
We were in the ""Superior Double Rooms"", they are the rooms in the old (original part) of the hotel. We were on the 1st floor, not so good as no view due to all the trees.
Are they old, yes, are they clean, yes, are they comfortable, yes.  The only down side we could see was the patio/balcony in the new building were generally bigger with nice new furniture, as the furniture in the old part is not good, 2 cement seats with a leaking air con unit over your head.
However, as I only sit on the balcony in a morning with a cup of coffee this did not bother me.
All the rooms had a fridge, kettle, tea, coffee,  water etc, hairdryer, and toiletries  in the bathroomnd,  safe in the wardrobe, the rooms were cleaned daily and beds changed.
Wifi in the rooms and around the hotel was excellent.
When we returned after our trip we again stayed in the'Superior Rooms""  (old part) but on the second floor, with much better views.
Second and third floor are the best in the old building, as they have the best views.
We stayed full board. 
The food thought was excellent, fresh  and tasty.
Breakfast and Dinner are both a buffet, Breakfast also had a hot counter for pancakes and omellets.
Dinner evenings were themed with usually a band playing.
Lunch is a fixed menu, a salad, a soup  and a multiple choices for mains and desert. I tried all the choices, they were excellent.
Service in restaurant was hit and miss, sometime a long wait for food or drinks, and sometimes, drinks did not arrive.
OUTSIDE AND POOL AREA 
The hotel has 2 pools, and lots of sun beds, both around the pools and on the grassed area under the Palm trees. BUT not a lot of parasols, which if your fair haired /skin then a real problem.  Lots of sun beds under parasols had towels on them which indicated they wre in use, andcwexwere advised by pool guys we could jot use rmthem, however, they sat empty until around 2.00pm each day, it was clear the pool guys were saving sun beds.  THAT was a problem. However, I was informed the hotel now had 2 new lady managers and changes were beginning to happen, so hopefully the saving of sun beds is on the list of things to he sorted.
Daily the pool guys would come around with iced cucumber for your eyes, cold flannels to cool you off and offer a glasses cleaning service, these little extras are what makes a holiday, and we thought it was wonderful.
OVERALL we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Camelot Beach, and the only negative for me,was the lack of Parasols.
We would definately book to go vack to Camelot, so Camelot Beach, please 🙏 get more Parasols ⛱️",Couples
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,1,Awful experience- avoid,"Absolutely awful service at reception, left for over 45 minutes with no one giving us an update. Then they tried to scam us over breakfast.

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,4,"Nice hotel, big improvements needed with restaurant staff and check in process.","Very nice hotel situated in a good location. There are improvements that need to be made, rooms are scruffy in parts, balcony doors are ‘foggy’. The waiting staff in the restaurant are extremely slow, you have to ask for everything twice and the restaurant was empty, big improvements needed in this area, management should be around to supervise this. Check in was also painfully slow, lots of time spent looking at a computer and you are just left waiting. This is a regular complaint amongst guests but it is still as bad. Staff we found the most helpful were Akash who worked by the pool side, such a lovely polite and efficient man, always smiling and extremely helpful, I hope hotel management appreciate his kindness. Thanks also to Anton, very helpful and eager to please. We will return next year, and hope the hotel will improve on the check in process and restaurant service which was very slow and disappointing. Please note the bar shuts by 10pm not 12 as quoted, this is a very quiet hotel.",Couples

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,4,Excellent beach resort,"We stayed here for two nights, and it’s easily one of the best beach resorts we’ve ever experienced. Upon arrival, the reception area, though not air-conditioned, felt warm, and the check-in process was a bit slow. However, the staff made up for it by offering refreshing fruit juice and a cool towel to freshen up.

We stayed in a spacious family room with a balcony, and the view of the beach was absolutely breathtaking. The beach is pristine and perfect for long walks during the day. It’s well-maintained, which added to the overall charm.

The resort features three swimming pools, all clean and inviting, though we didn’t get a chance to try the spa. Breakfast was a buffet with an excellent variety of options, catering to diverse tastes. While the rooms were comfortable, they did appear a bit tired and could use some updating.

Despite minor drawbacks, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The tranquil ambiance, beautiful beachfront, and thoughtful amenities made it a memorable getaway.",Couples
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,5,Hotel is Fabulous due to the wonderful staff.,"Whole experience of staying at Camelot Beach was positive. I had a great room with beach and sea view. The room was exceptionally clean and beds extremely comfortable and fresh bedding. 
Special mentions for Nishanthe and Kokilla who served at the bar, always with a smile and great attention. Mohammed and the two lovely young ladies in the restaurant (sorry can’t remember their names) always so helpful and again greet with big smiles. Anton the room / housekeeping manager who was so attentive in making sure that guests needs are met and ran an amazing team of staff. The pool guys who ensured comfort with sun beds and adequate shade. Even the gardeners go out of their way to say good morning and ask if there is anything you need. 
The staff at this hotel really go out of their way to make sure guest experience is at its best. The General Manager at this hotel never seemed quite as happy as her staff, certainly didn’t smile and charged around finding fault. It’s a shame she doesn’t see how wonderful the staff are and give them credit where it’s due.",Friends
Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,3,"Great Hotel, But Disappointing Policy","The hotel itself was fantastic; however, I can only rate it 3 out of 5 for one major issue. As a family of four (two adults and two kids), I requested an extra key card for our room, but the response I received was baffling: “Our hotel policy allows only one key card per room.” This rigid policy created a lot of inconvenience and left me with an unpleasant experience.

While I recommend this hotel for solo travelers, I would advise families to reconsider if having more flexibility is important for their stay.",Family

Pasikuda,Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa - Thema Collection,5,A Stay Worth Every Penny: Pure Bliss from Start to Finish,"Me along with my wife travelled to Pasikudha, with making a booking to stay at Malu Malu Resort and Spa, in celebration of our wedding anniversary. As I did want to have a detour before we checked in to the hotel, we did travel more distance than travelling direct, which lead to us being on the road double the travel time. 

Reached the hotel on March 13, 2025 around 6 in the evening, and was greeted by a person from the hotel staff with a warm and friendly smile and was directed to the front office staff. The staff greeted us, and Chamara the front office manager was the first person to speak to us. He was friendly and was very helpful, in getting our checking in process done in a timely manner. One thing that was great was the cool towels given to freshen up, and the absolutely super passion fruit sorbet which was really a super pick me up for a person who has been on the road for 12 hours, and in hot weather condition. We were welcomed with a garland of flowers, and according to the Tamil traditions. 

The front office managers duties did not end at the point of checking in but he was the person who escorted us to our room, and showed where everything was within the room, so the we do not have to spend time thinking or looking. The room we stayed was super, spacious, and everything was clean and neat. We would also like to thank the hotel team for the lovely decorations done in our room wishing us for our anniversary. 

During our two day stay we had an awesome time, waling on the beach, the dip in the sea to the time spent in the pool, where the water was warm and nice (to be honest I didn’t want to come out of the pool in the evening).

The food at the buffet was super and a good spread of which I did enjoy the roasted pork with pineapple sauce, and the baked tune with garlic butter to name a few (however, whilst the spread of food was great, wish you guys had more seafood). On the second day, we were too full and did not go for the buffe but just ordered two portion of food that would go along with a beer to enjoy. The food which included a Devilled Pork (which was one of the best I have had), and a hot buttered cuttlefish (which I would not recommend as it was batter fried cuttlefish rather than what it is supposed to be). However, this did not mean that we were let down. 

One more great thing was the fact that Chamara the front office manager, and Janaka the F&B manger paid attention to each and every guest, and did speak to them on a daily basis to ensure that he guest were being taken care of, and to attention to any needs. 

A big thank you to both as well as the entire team at the hotel. Will never hesitate to recommend you guys… keep up the good work.",Family

Airport stay after long plane journey ”

so the hotel was close to the airport, on the beach. Lovely rooftop pool, with views over the sea.
Comfortable beds. (Although we had two single beds for 3 of us, as they said I didn't inform them we needed an extra bed although i booked 2 adults1 child, so we had to share with our 14 year old son) but the beds were large singles, so this was fine. 
Good breakfast lots of variety. Overall, it's fine for airport stay, but not much to do for longer stay.",Family
Negombo,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,4,Good but not quite a great hotel.,"A decent hotel next to the beach not far from the main road to bars, shops and restaurants. We were upgraded to a Junior suite as our balcony with lateral sea views looked straight on to a building site. Fair play they moved us straight away. Only problem, our A/C leaked and flooded a small part of our room one night, towels were not changed one morning and on another when no toilet paper was replenished even though it’s was obvious we ran out. First world problem not an issue. All was rectified very quickly. Issue I had was the very limited Sun beds on rooftop but that’s due to space and there’s no shade at all from the burning sun. The issue being that 2 of the 4 Sun beds that are in the shade were selfishly taken by a couple of women who did not use them at all for well over an hour that we were there. Just their bags and towels. In fact, they went away for 30 mins then came back and sat at the tables to have a very leisurely lunch! I was informed by a member of staff later that they left the area completely after their lunch after I had gone and so never actually used them at all. In all that time no one could use those sunbeds at all… How selfish. Also, another lady had arrived before us had the same issue and tried to reserve the beds but then these 2 ladies arrived and dumped their stuff on the beds. There needs to be a policy here, (if sunbeds are left empty for more than x mins your things will be removed…) which I spoke to their staff about but they couldn’t do anything as they were told by the women not to move their bags etc and totally agreed with what I was saying. Not the staff’s fault but management needs to sort this out. Nearly threw the bag and towels off the rooftop myself!

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,1,Leaking in the room and terrible customer service,"We were travelling with our 1 year old daughter and arrived at 5pm after 6 hours drive, check in was quite slow and we were the only ones at reception. Once we arrived in the room we had 2 twin beds even through we booked a double, and the baby cot we requested was not in the room. We then had to wait for 1 hours until the new room was ready, which meant our 1 year old baby was super grumpy by the time we finally arrive in the new room to put her to bed.

Once we put the baby to bed my wife went to take a shower and we noticed water coming back from the sink (the sink is actually located outside the bathroom) with a terrible smell, the water was also returning from the drains in the bathroom floor, flooding the entire bathroom. I called the manager to let him know but said it would be impossible for us to leave the room as the baby was sleeping.

The next day at check out I mentioned it again, and the duty manager then removed the bill (for 2 beers) that was in front of me and said she would call her manager. After a super long wait, the manager simply said something to one of the receptionist and left. I then asked the receptionist what was happening and she said they were giving us 50% discount, which I then thanked them for it. Turns out the 50% discount was on the 2 beers we consumed, so it was like a USD5 dollars discount.

At that point I was already late to leave it to the airport and was shocked that this was what they were offering for a major leaked, and flood in the room. I asked them to call the manager again, but she never showed up. Just a disgrace.",Family

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,1,Appalling service and hygiene practices.,"The service was absolutely terrible. Most of the staff, especially in the bar were not trained at all. I wanted to sit and order lunch and the waiter proceeded to wipe my table and chair with a dirty beach towel that was sitting in a pile of dirty towels. The waiter couldn’t understand what I ordered so just ended up ordering what he could understand which was rice. I waited 40 minutes for my order and when it came he dropped some of it on the floor. I got up and left. The bedroom on the first floor had mold all over it and in the bathroom. I moved to a different room which was much better. I have stayed here a few times over the years and I’ve never seen it this bad. My stay was completely ruined. Whoever owns this hotel really needs to train their staff properly as guests will not put up with that service when they are paying so much money. I will never return to this hotel again.",Solo

Negombo,Camelot Beach Hotel,5,Fantastic stay after a long flight from the UK,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport. 8hrs from home to Heathrow and then a 10hr flight we felt we could do with some relaxation. This we got in bucket loads. Where to start!? We were met by caring staff who took our bags and gave us a cold fruit juice. After the briefest of check ins we were taken to a well stocked immaculate room, so clean and tidy overlooking one of the two pools. After a few drinks at the pool bar we had a buffet dinner. The choice was spectacular, freshly cooked and so tasty. Breakfast the next morning was of a similar high standard. 

One or two nights at the start or end of your Sri Lankan trip in my mind a must.",Couples

Nuwara Eliya,Araliya Green City,4,Centrally located city hotel,"Different to the traditional style Inns and hotels in Nuwara Eliya, we were experiencing a place with modern concepts of hospitality somewhat similar to a city hotel in a commercial centre. Araliya Green city was a comfortable hotel. 

Room we were occupying was warm and cozy but a bit cluttered with furniture. Bath cum Toilet was comparatively compact in relation to the space in the room. We found it difficult to freely access the safety locker as it was placed opposite a large closet providing only a narrow space between them. It was inconvenient to open the safe due to lack of space in front. It would be good if this receives attention. May be the issue can be easily solved by moving this piece of furniture containing the safe to a more spacious area within the room providing better operating space.  

The concept of having a food court accessible from the hotel helped us to select what we liked from a variety of cuisine. The garden space adjacent to the food court was very colourful and attractive. 

Heated pool in the enclosed upper most floor was an important amenity which we appreciated but we found the lounge area in the ground floor rather cold to relax. Cold draft was regularly blowing in through the entrance every time the door opened and this area did not have heating.",Family

,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Safari,"Hi,
We here for a 2 day safari adventure and opted for a full day safari, 
The tents are quite simplistic, good ventilation, no TV, very very rustic and enjoyable surrounded by nature.
During the safari, we nearly drove around at least about 135 KM within the park.
Though bumpy (expected) its was quite an experience to see so many animals up close.
Fortunately we had an experience driver, Kasun and a even more knowledgeable naturalist, Dilhara, whose knew the park by the back of his hand and was very detailed in his explanation of both the flora, fauna and especially the animals whereabouts.
i will highly recommend anyone to visits this place and enjoy the nature in raw. Suited for all ages.
Cheers",Family

,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Amazing day safari with Dilhara and Samantha!,"Absolutely fantastic experience with Dilhara and Samantha. 4 of us went on a day safari in Yala. The whole process was extremely smooth and well planned out vs other safari's we'd been on. Dilhara was highly knowledgable on everything from animals, to the park, interesting facts and he had an absolute eagle eye for spotting animal interactions around the vehicle. We managed to see 4 leopards on the trip too which isn't always guaranteed, so needless to say, we had a great time - 10/10, would highly recommend!",Friends
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Super safari with Dilhara and Asanka,"Had great two safari's with guide Dilhara and driver Asanka. We are travelling with two younger kids and they always looking out for them.
They quickly manouvered us to a good spot to spot the leopards and Asanka made sure with smart moves that we had a great viewing point.
At the same time Dilhara shared much of his knowledge (and he was Truely knowlegable) about the nature and animal kingdom with us. Which made the trips even more valuable. All in all great experience. With many many animals!
The tents were also spacious and perfectly clean. Al tough was super Hot days, with the big fans still doable in the night and both kids slept fine.",Family
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,What an experience,"What an experience.  I'd been put off camping since being a young girl due to shower blocks!  This was off the chart.  The tents were secluded and quiet, with everything you could wish for, even massive fans.  We went on safari from there which was incredible.  Candelit dinner where the food was excellent and the service even better.  Only stayed for one night but the breakfast was amazing, can't recommend it highly enough.",Family

Great Guide' MJ ' and great Front Desk ,' Raj' . This is the base to see Leopards. Thankfully and with great fortune, saw 2 leopards on the One day Safari ( 12 hours) long day but very wonderful . Suggest this is a good ' mid point' in a busy Sri Lanka Tour- it's a place to relax in nature, very close to the World's most precious animals.",Solo
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,1,Not worth the money!!!!,"Our party of 5 recently stayed for 2 nights at Mahoora Tented Safari in Yala. 
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible.
We enjoyed three game drives and managed to see Leopards on 2 separate occasions which is apparently extremely rare. Our driver and Naturalist were amazing with their knowledge.
Unfortunately the actual tented safari camp was a major disappointment.
The tents themselves are old with the floors being so damp we had to wear shoes in the tent so our feet didn't get wet.
The company doesn't provide mosquito nets which would have been fine if the tents didn't have holes in them letting in all the bugs. One tent had a crab next the bed in the morning.
First night we had no hot water. This was rectified but the next issue was the pressure pump then constantly turning on and off for the next 24 hours- no sleep.  After raising this issue with the staff, we were informed that that is normal - no its not!!!
The shower was adequate but the smell in the toilet /shower area was disgusting. Upon investigation, the shower runoff simply goes behind the tent and there was an open hole on top of the sewage pit. Hence the smell. 
The food was nice Sri Lankan food with plenty available.
To keep your drinks cold there is a communal fridge in the main area. This means every time you want a drink you have to walk from your tent - our 2 tents were about 150 metres from the main area. Also make sure phone has plenty of charge as you will need your torch. They did not provide one and navigating at night is impossible without one.
We have stayed in many safari style accomodations throughout the world and this is by far the worst for value. 
If the price was around $300 per night I probably would have sucked it up and not posted this review. But for US$1800 for 2 tents for 2 nights, the company needs to do a lot better.
We chose this company as it was owned by people living in Australia (we are Aussies).
I feel sorry for the staff as they work so hard to please all the guests, but they are let down by old and inadequate infrastructure.",Family
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Leopards,The Safari with Dilhara and Kasun was really nice. Dilhara knows a lot about the animals and was really good in spotting the Leopards.

,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Yala National Park tour,"We spent one of our two days completing the Safari with the wonderful Dilhara who took us on a tour of Yala national park. 
He was so knowledgable about all aspects of the wildlife and natural habitat of the animals that we encountered. 
Genuinely proud to share with us what he knew and excited to accompany us on the hunt for wildlife.

Would defo recommend - even with the 5am alarm haha",Couples
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,4,Safari with Solomon,The tented village is on the edge of the national park and we were there for the safari experience. The tents have a small bathroom which was fine for the time we were there but space is at a premium it’s fairly basic. The bed was comfortable and a fan kept us cool but this isn’t luxury camping. The high points though is Solomen a phenomenally enthusiastic and talented naturalist with extraordinary eyesight. We did an afternoon and early morning safari and whilst we didn’t see the elusive leopard plenty of elephants eagles kingfishers and crocodiles more than made up for it .The food we had far exceeded our expectations it was very good and all the team at the safari made us very welcome and the foot bath at the end of the day awaiting outside tithe tent was a lovely touch,Couples
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,"Fantastic experience made more memorable by our excellent naturalist guide, Vimansha",We spent 3 nights at Mahoora tented safari camp. The food and service from the staff was excellent. We went on 4 half day safaris and one full day and were accompanied by a wonderful naturalist called Vimansha on all of the safaris. His enthusiasm for wildlife was contagious and his knowledge of the wildlife and especially birds was encyclopedic! One of the safaris was to Bundala where not only did we see many birds but also some elephants and the scenery was beautiful. Worth the drive as also very peaceful there. The drivers on all our trips were great turning off the engine at each stop and one of them spotted a leopard for us.,Couples

Without him we probably wouldn't have seen so many animals! We even spotted some leopards, elefants and crocodiles! 
Our driver Kasun did a great job as well and we felt very comfortable the whole time! 
Food was amazing and full of varieties.
The only thing you should be prepared of, that during the stay in the camp you can only use the bathroom within the tent, so make sure you're close with the people you're going with;) 
Also the flush there doesn't have a lot of pressure, so pooping could be kind of a problem;)  
But luckily for us it was not a problem:)",Friends
Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,5,The best Stay at Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,"We had the most wonderful experience staying at Dream Cliff Mountain Resort. From the day we arrived until the day we left, the staff and management looked after us so well, it really felt like home.

The location of the resort is beautiful. It’s up in the mountains, and we had the most amazing views from our Beehive Room, the swimming pool, and even the dining area. Everywhere you looked, there were stunning mountain views.

One thing that really stood out to us was how well they looked after our food needs. We don’t eat onion or garlic, and every day the chef made us special meals off the menu. It meant a lot to us and made our stay even more comfortable.

What we loved the most was their attitude. It felt like the word “no” didn’t exist for them. Every request we had, big or small, was taken care of with a smile.

Since we stayed there for 6 nights, the resort even surprised us with a small going-away gift. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made us feel really special.

We left with lovely memories and so much appreciation for the whole team.",Couples

The backdrop was the majestic cliffs of the Haputale Range. Very well kept dome shaped rooms, two pools including one infinity pool merging with the rolling hills and the planes. All the staff, service and the food were excellent.  The manager Mr Raphael Dias had his feet firmly on the ground and took good care of us. Steward Athula went out of his way assisted by Pradeep, to mention only a few.  Reminded us of     Rev Walter Stanley Senior, that English poet with a Sri Lankan heart, who was in love with this area and whose  ashes are interred at the most picturesque St. Andrew's Church, Haputale, nearby.

Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,5,Paradise found - at Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,"We had the most glorious time at Dream Cliff Mountain resort! The beehive cabanas are all overlooking the beautiful and breathtaking Beragala gap, with the udawalawe reservoir in the back ground. We spent hours on our balcony as the view seemed to change every few minutes based on the sun! When it was behind a cloud the mist slowly crept in between the mountains creating shadows on land below, and when the sun came out the mist disappeared illuminating the hills and valleys. We were even able to experience the early morning sunrise and evening sunset from the comfort of our balcony.
The resort is above a panoramic view of mountain ranges with an infinity pool that allows us to soak in the sun while enjoying the view.

The restaurant is very spacious and the food was delicious! The staff were very accommodating and went over and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.
We went on a hike and the hotel arranged transport and a guide to take us which was very helpful. The village trek ends at a beautiful waterfall which was a thrill for all of us.

Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,5,Spoilt with choices,"The room was spacious (although the bathroom needs to have somewhere to hang towels or wet clothes) as was the lobby/reception area. What stood out most, though, was the quality and presentation of foods on offer at each meal, always visually attractive and with personal attention to service. The pool was refreshing and of good size, too.",Couples
Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,5,A beautiful hotel in Kandy,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, and it was a wonderful experience start to end. This hotel is really beautiful, and although it may seem far away from the Kandy centre, it is convenient to travel by Tuk Tuk which only took us about 10 mins. We found it much better to stay at this location than the Kandy centre due to the hotel experience. 

The staff makes a huge difference. The service is really good overall, but a special mention for Rajani in the main restaurant (Far Pavillion). Rajani was very mindful of the small details, and even went out of the way to accomodate a special meal request, which was really appreciated.",Couples

Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,2,Not great,"Not up to the standard you might expect from 5 star, particularly after coming from the Shangri la and going to W15 afterwards. One of the rooms sprung a leek and flooded the room. The food was bad/stale (yoghurt was disgusting, dosa was sad and moist). Dinner buffet didn’t start until 7:30pm (not accomodating to kids at all) rude manager at the front desk who refused to give us an extra key because they had “run out of keys” but then after a third try, magically found one in his pocket (also 75% of the hotel was empty). Never a smile from him. Having to ask 3 times seems to be a trend, as they weren’t doing tea at breakfast(!?), but then magically found some after we asked again.  Always had to keep an eye on whether they’d figured out which bags are ours. Dead fish in the fish tank. The “pool room” was a stinky dark mould-den. Carpets in the hall were old and rotten.
Only saving grace is that it’s got a beautiful view at the bar, and a nice pool.",Family
Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,3,Does the job,"This hotel has some pros and cons. The lobby is beautiful, however the bedrooms had some room for improvement regarding cleanliness and details.

Unfortunately my room flooded because of an exploded bidet?? The staff were great and got us a new room, however this shouldn’t be happening in a five star hotel and we are lucky that our things weren’t damaged. 

The pool table room was musty, which was quite disappointing because we love to play pool.

The swimming pool was great and the lobby and gardens are lovely. The views of the surrounding area are STUNNING.

Breakfast and dinner buffets were lack lustre.

This hotel is fine if you need somewhere to stay, but I wouldn’t expect luxury.",Family

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",2,An awful experience,"Stayed here for three nights.  On the first night we came back to our room and it had water dripping from the ceiling, the floor was wet, as was the bedding and our luggage.  We asked for a new room and were  moved to the second floor where the same thing happened.  When we got to the room the temperature was on 17 degrees - freezing 🥶 .  Management told us that we had to keep the room at this temperature to stop the condensation 🤦‍♀️. We had to get another blanket as it was so cold.  We couldn’t stay in the room because it was so cold, and it didn’t seem to stop the condensation.  We put the temperature back to 22 just so we could be in the room.  It was also very dangerous as the floor was slippery and we had to use our bath towels on the floor to stop us from falling over! Our room didn’t get cleaned until after 6pm the next day as the Sri Lankan cricket team had arrived and this took priority - the next day it was 5pm as we were trying to get ready to go out.  We have travelled all over the world and never had this problem - management told us it was the air conditioning - needs to be fixed as a matter of urgency.  Will never return.",Couples

Yes, heights don't mix with me.
A room upgrade, extra cost, and more than happy. The size was  too big for one pers however, a retirement gift to me. Staff were more than happy to make the change. Meals here are your traditional Sri Lankan meals with more than a mix of European cuisine. When in Rome though, do as the Romans do.

The drink which was made out of tambili was very nice and refreshing. They do some nice cocktails. I thought the room service food menu prices are  a bit too expensive and was the only reason which made us stop a ordering from the room service menu even though we wanted to order something. Each and every food item which we had at the buffet was very mouthwatering tasty and remarkable. Probably it's the most tastiest food and the best buffet you can find in this part of Sri Lanka. The very blessed atmosphere which you can find in down south. They have a kids play area which kept our naughty little boy occupied and happy. The pool is very nice and clean we didn't feel like to coming out of it . The roof top bar and the pool bar have a great atmosphere they also provide a excellent service and they do some nice cocktails.

Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,1,Disappointing experience at the Earl's Regency Hotel,"This hotel is located in a beautiful area however, farther than we thought from all the tourist attractions on Kandy. The condition of the room was poor, the shower door did not close, creating a pool of water in the bathroom. The shower cubicle had mould in it, the room telephones had incorrect room numbers pasted on them. There was a significant lack of attention to detail. 
Although we called reception several times, communication was difficult as no one could understand the concerns. Better training of reception staff is recommended. The food offered was awful. There was nothing in the dinner buffet that tasted any good, this includes the Sri-Lankan style fusion cuisine they tried to create and other. We were a large family staying there, and all agreed that food was terrible. We will not be recommending this hotel to any of our friends or family.",Family

I got billed for extra drinks, as the Manager refused to accept staff error, when he had agreed for wine and gin under Happy Hours! Worse, the Manager says what's done is done, but we cant change it now, and it has to be paid....we will offer you something extra at breakfast trow!!!

Heavy mosquitoes, dimly lit place....plus with the experience from the Manager in acknowledging the error, but refusing to do anything about it....felt like a homestay setup. 

Mistakes can happen anywhere but acknowledging and the honest effort to make the guest satisfied when he leaves, is what seperates a good establishment from a poorly run one.",Family

Galle,Yara Galle Fort,5,Simply stunning hotel in a perfect location,"We were  group of 6 who had booked 3 rooms for 5 nights in this wonderful hotel. We were really happy with our choice. 

This quaint & authentic hotel is perfectly situated in a slightly quieter part of beautiful Galle, still within easy walking distance from all of the sights & sounds. Rooms were immaculately clean with large modern bathrooms. We were extremely well looked after by the hotel staff, particularly so by Sithija & Akanasha who couldn't do enough to help. They were a great credit to this lovely hotel. 

Sithija set our outside table up for breakfast every morning so that we could all sit together. Breakfast was fantastic, huge choices cooked to perfection - with a Sri Lankan breakfast option also on offer. As we were staying for 5 nights we were all treated to a complimentary 3 course dinner, it was superb and once again served on our favourite outside table.

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,Great food; a stunning pool; but needs a serious make-over.,"This is a huge hotel which caters for large groups.  It has a stunning pool, an adequate gym and lovely views from all rooms.  There are lots of organised leisure activities around the pool.  The food at all meals is some of the best mass-produced hotel food I’ve ever eaten.  It’s all buffet style but very good and very safe.  It’s a bit of a distance from Galle Fort and the main city but there are plenty of tuk tuks available.

It could be a great hotel with a lot more attention to detail.  The first room we were shown was awful, with only one side table by the bed, an extra bed along the side and hardly any room to hang clothes.  As we were staying for two weeks we needed more space.  The rather officious front office staff told us that there were no suites available for us to upgrade. But once we contacted the marvellous guest relations staffer, Ashan, everything changed.  He found a large room with a sitting area and a huge terrace and plenty of space to move around and to hang clothes.  The room had a ceiling fan which the previous room did not.  The bed was comfortable but the curtains had holes in them as if moths had eaten them and they were half hanging off their rails.  The bed side tables were useless - no drawers  and  inadequate space for night needs.  There was a good desk and good enough lighting.  Great shower.  The room needs a make over and new furniture and curtains.

Great bar staff at the pool bar who were very helpful when it started raining.  We read into Ashan a number of times; he gave us great advice of things to do in Galle itself and wanted to know about our experience of the hotel.  He’s a real asset.",Friends

All staff kind, happy, friendly and professional. Ajith was a particularly lovely member of staff. Would highly recommend.",Family
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,3 night stay - lots of positives but food left us disappointed..,"Spent three nights over the Easter/Sinhala & Tamil new year. Positives: 1) Well located (short drive to Galle town, nice Hotel beach). 2) Rooms are spacious, air conditioning worked well. 3) Nice lobby, lounge area. 4) Staff were helpful, e.g we were allowed to use the lounge past our checkout time to freshen up (shower etc).  5) Pool area very good. 6)  cultural evening on Avrudu day was good. 7) good discounts for amex holders/radisson members on food.

Development points: 1) Buffet food did not compare to other hotels we stayed at on this holiday (e.g Kingsbury, Habarana Village). Also I stayed here when it was an Amari Hotel, food was superior back then. Small issues like no Prawns at the buffet at all. The only caveat was that on the day of the Avrudu celebration, the food stations were very good. 2) Need a better solution for coffees/teas near the pool. If you are not full board, one could end up spending £3-4 on machine coffee every time. 3) Buffet should be organised in a clearer fashion. I.e someone should be at the front noting down room number and then another person taking the group of guests to the table. 

Taking the above into consideration it was a pleasant stay but not worth the elevated prices we paid during the Sri Lankan new year period. If the food and buffet experience was improved then the Radisson Blu would be a one of the strongest Hotels in the region (in my humble opinion).",Family
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,GREAT STAY EXCEPT FOR POOL BAR!,"Radisson Blu Resort Galle was a lovely 2 day stay.

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",5,Had a fantastic stay.,"Had a wonderful stay at the Radisson, the staff were excellent, could not do enough for you. The breakfast choice was incredible, staff made sure you wanted for nothing . Pool area was spotless. We loved going to the roof bar of an evening. We were so well looked after by the staff. In the restaurant the head chef was always watching and making sure everything was well stocked. The only small criticism was that the rooms could do with a freshen up. The rest of the hotel was excellent.,",Couples
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",5,Lovely 4 star stay!!,"We had a really lovely time at the hotel for 6 nights! We went on a whale watching tour, explored Galle (about 15 mins drive away), visited the local restaurants (go to Luuma!), surfed at Ahikava School, visited Dalawella beach (wild turtles swimming) and went to a turtle release at Koggala at sunset! :)

The breakfast was lovely with a big selection including personalised omelettes. The pool area is lovely and right next to the beach! There were plenty of cocktails and drinks options!
You need to try their local Arrack it was lovely. There's a few side-of-the-pool meal options too for a reasonable price. There's a few cute cats that roam around too and we spotted a land monitor lizard a couple times too! They stay out of your way though if you don't like them.

Ajith deserves a special mention as the towel guy who made sure we were all happy every day and knew where our go-to spot was. Thilini the guest experience curator was also lovely and was super helpful to arrange a bouquet of flowers and room decorations for our Mothers Day! (Rs 11,500 for the flowers)

On the other side, we have been fortunate to stay in a few 5 star hotels and we didn't feel it met the same standards as the others. The rooms need a bit of TLC as they looked outdated compared to the website photos. We also had a recurring issue of our rooms being cleaned but our towels not being replaced (so was left with no towels every evening until we phoned reception and had some delivered). There also are apparently activities every day but when we went to a few, we were told they weren’t operating like the cooking class and beach volleyball. But apart from this it was a lovely stay, thank you!",Family

Food was generally good and enjoyable.”",Family

From the moment we arrived and looked across at the glorious vista of pool and sea up to the horizon I knew this was going to be a super stay.  The hotel is positioned very well with all rooms facing the beach and the staff work hard to keep the place gleaming. Moreover, it was the food that was the star of this great show. Galle flavours are so tasty and the Sri Lankan cuisine plus Indian and Western are prepared with great flavours. Special mention to Sunethra who served up lovely hoppers and seeni sambol - my favourite! the chefs are fabulous and the pool offering lane swimming in the morning was my jam. I highly recommend you stay here - take in what Galle has to offer and head off in a tuk tuk. We had a blast.",Friends
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",3,Beautiful Location,"Hotel is located right on the beach and has beautiful views from the rooms and right from the lobby. Food was great, would have given the hotel 5 stars except for an odd check-in experience. We arrived at 6:30pm and our rooms were still not ready. It took over an hour after we arrived to get the rooms ready and they stuck us in a deserted lobby room where we had to pay for tea while waiting.",Friends
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,"Great location , Good hotel but could be so much better","Location a bit far out but lively beach location. Food was as expected for a 4* hotel. We arrived at 4pm and had to wait 30 mins for a room to be made up for us ….check in was supposed to be 2 pm so not a good start.
The hotel on the first night was packed out making the dining in the half board buffet during the first night a bit chaotic and extremely noisy. The second night was much better and as expected for this quality of hotel.
Rooms however were lovely all of which had a fabulous sea view.",Couples
Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",5,Very nice stay 4.5/5,"We spent 2 nights here and this hotel just about sneaks into the 5/5 score. More like 4.5/5. I don't give 5/5 often for 5 star hotels as I expect a lot. Firstly, the service from start to finish was excellent, the only exception being being a very late room servicing. Our room was large, very clean, great AC with a well appointed spacious bathroom. Nice sea views and a usable balcony. The pool area is nice, quite large with various seating areas including cabanas which always get reserved early in the morning, around the pool. The pool bar does food, which was very handy, good quality and decent value. For dinner, there is a buffet, or you could eat at the rooftop bar, which would be extra to half board. There are also various other options at the other restaurant. I would normally knock off a point for any 5 star hotel doing a dinner buffet, but their buffet was actually pretty good. Lots of variety, all hot and also a cooking station or two. The desserts were excellent. The rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit, especially around sunset. Overall, a very nice package.",Couples

Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,5,Great hotel with breathtaking view,"We stayed here for 3 nights on a tour around Sri Lanka. There are interesting cultural sites within a 1-2 hour drive. We did a great hike through the tea plantations and there is also a train ride from Haputale towards Colombo that I would recommend, providing amazing views of the plantations. 
In the hotel, the rooms are lovely with breathtaking views. From your room you see a huge vista with mountains in the backdrop. It is a stunning view. The staff are lovely and made us feel very welcome. The food is good with a wide menu. The pool area is good, with attentive staff and an infinity pool looking out over the view.",Couples
Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,4,A hotel in midst of expansion,"The hotel is currently expanding, which makes the older sections feel neglected while the newer areas remain unfinished.

We stayed for three nights in one of the modern electric blue beehive rooms. The views from the balcony were spectacular, but the room’s design had some frustrating flaws. For example, the bedside reading light switch was inconveniently placed, requiring you to get out of bed to turn it off. Similarly, reaching the toilet paper from the seat was awkwardly difficult.

I had expected scenic hill paths for pre-dinner strolls, but unfortunately, the surroundings don’t offer much in that regard. Additionally, be prepared for long drives—most tourist attractions are at least one to two hours away by car each way.

That said, as with all six hotels we stayed at in southern Sri Lanka, the staff were warm, gentle, and often proactive in their service.",Couples

From our arrival and initial greeting, until departure, our entire stay was made so special by the Sri Lankan charm held by all those working at this resort. They couldn’t have done enough for us. 

The resort itself is set in a stunning landscape, and the Beehive rooms are totally unique. You feel completely connected to the abundance of nature surrounding you in this idyllic setting. Not to mention the infinity pool which will take your breath away.  

The views are unrivalled - watch sunrise and sunset from your personal balcony and drink in the beauty of where you are.",Couples
Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,5,The Widest Views of Sri Lanka from a Bee Hive.,"We recently stayed 4 nights after having seen the Resort advertised on Social Media and asking our Travel company to include it in our itinerary.

From the first reveal from reception to our last sunrise vista from our Bee Hive, we were wowed by the breathtaking views which reach beyond the Lake in Udawalawa, from where I am now writing this review. We experienced almost every type of weather over the four days and even when it was pouring with rain the view was stunning.

We really enjoyed the traditional welcome, and the Bee Hive cabanas with our private views. As I’d expected from the advert they are a bit querky  but very comfortable with everything you need & the views are amazing.

Service and food at the restaurant, where we ate a lot were very high and all of the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed our local gin & tonics at the bar before dinner.

Our four nights allowed us some downtime after a busy trip but there are interesting places to visit like the Dambatenne Tea Factory, Lipton’s Seat and Bambarakanda waterfall.",Couples
Beragala,Dream Cliff Mountain Resort,5,Breathtaking views with stunning swimming pool.,"The hotel has breathtaking views, a stunning swimming pool which has just been built, pleasant and helpful staff who can’t do enough for you and reasonably priced food. I was told that the Sri Lankan breakfast was delicious, but I didn’t actually try it myself. We were a bit disappointed that the hotel was so far from, Ella, but by the end of our stay this didn’t matter at all, because the views made up for it. Be aware that the hotel is on a cliff edge and when it is windy, it can be very noisy in the bee hives/rooms.",Couples

We lived in one of the new King Beehives and it was a dream sitting at the porch absorbing nature at its best. The pool and restaurant were beautifully designed and we enjoyed great food at the place. If you like to hike then you find a lot of routes nearby and you can even walk directly from the resort to Kirawanagama nature falls. A little local place where you can swim under the waterfall without meeting any other tourists.
Be aware that the resort is expanding the restaurant area, but it was not interfering with our stay and they are only working at the level above the restaurant.",Couples

After the long ride from Colombo to Sigiriya, it was nice to relax at the garden/pool area.

Kalkudah,Amaya Beach - Pasikudah,3,Service and staff needs improvement,"Hotel is nice.  Location is good. Food is very good if it is Sri Lankan.  Western foods are ok at best. However guest to staff ratio is inadequate for this price point.  Also, staff need’s training for more professionalism.  Mistakes were made in room service orders and had to call multiple times to get toilet paper.  Also departments such as housekeeping don’t answer the phone.  

Also only lobby, main restaurant and rooms are air conditioned. Rest of the hotel is hot.

Also crows and a cat was roaming in the open bar area.

Is the Spa treatments were good but more care and warmth is needed when interacting with customers.

At first glance hotel looks very nice but once you stay for a while you notice the deficiencies.

We had a Suite for 3 days.  Suite it self was very functional and had a very nice view.  Also pool was nice and warm.",Family

When we requested for some bread rolls to be packed as we were leaving on a long trip, it was arranged for us at once. When we requested for something not on the menu, they said it was possible to male it for us anyway. It was lovely staying at Amaya. The rooms were clean and spacious.

Kalkudah,Amaya Beach - Pasikudah,5,Stunning hotel in paradise,"An absolutely stunning hotel in paradise.  It’s a large hotel but quiet this time of year    . The hotel is right on the beach and has a lovely large pool.  There are plenty of sunbeds around the pool and on the grass area under trees. The rooms are very spacious with lovely large modern bathrooms with showers and baths. Our room had a balcony and sea view.  The food was excellent in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner - all you could possibly want - both eastern and western. We enjoyed the curries and hoppers but great selection of everything.  We also enjoyed the bar looking out to the pool and beach and also the small casual Honey bar on the beach.   The bay is a beautiful walk from the hotel to the other end and back.  Very sandy beach and calm sea. 
All the staff and management were very friendly and helpful.  Our group of 6 loved it there.",Couples
Kalkudah,Amaya Beach - Pasikudah,5,An unforgettable experience in paradise,"I had an excellent stay and an unforgettable experience. The staff couldn't be nicer or more attentive. The place is truly a paradise — it features its own infinity pool and a private beach with white sand and crystal-clear waters. There are several restaurants and bars, offering enough variety to enjoy something different every day. The food is outstanding, both international and local cuisine. And the mojito... easily one of the best I've ever had in my life! 
A special mention goes to Ahamed Hamdhan for his excepcional hospitality and for going beyond to make our stay as wonderful as it was. We felt at home.",Friends
Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,5,Highly recommended,"Absolutely loved our stay here – from start to finish, everything was just spot on.

First of all, the staff. So warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind – they made us feel like valued guests, not just another booking. Always ready with a smile, helpful tips, and nothing ever felt like too much trouble. It’s rare to come across hospitality this thoughtful and effortless.

The breakfasts? Incredible. A proper highlight of each day. Fresh fruit, flaky pastries, great coffee, and something new to try every morning. You could tell everything was prepared with care – it felt more like a homemade spread than a standard hotel buffet.

And then there’s the pool area – absolute bliss. Clean, spacious, and beautifully designed with plenty of loungers and shady spots. We spent hours there just unwinding, with the occasional dip in the crystal-clear water.

All in all, this place completely exceeded our expectations. We left feeling relaxed and happy!",Family

Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,4,Improvements in activities needed,"Should have some sports like Tennis, Badminton & Table tennis to complete the vacation with children, Only the swimming pool is not enough.

Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,5,Fantastic hotel in Kandy,"We are an early 40s British couple who thought this hotel was a high quality and standard.

Their customer service was amazing, especially the manager (can’t remember his name) who spoke very good English. Helped us with a few transfer challenges with our company doing the translating etc. 

We were welcomed with a drink on arrival and swiftly helped to our room. Our house keeper was great fun, checked on us and left us pretty towel displays on the bed to make us feel welcome. Room was lovely, had a fantastic view with our balcony.

The bar service was also very good as was all inclusive buffet, lots of choice and 

We would say it did get a bit busy and felt crowded for evening dinners. They have small bands playing music round the tables though that’s a special touch.  

The swimming pool was also very nice and well kept by facilities. It is a good style and well placed to capture the sun in this woodland space. Views surrounding are lovely, it’s very serene. 

I think our two comments for consideration would be swimming pool drinks and service was a bit hard to order and took a while to come as it had to come from restaurant/bar. 

It was ideal for us in between locations but it’s a bit far out from main Kandy and you can’t walk to the main places. 

Worth a stay though!",Couples
Kundasale,Earl's Regency Hotel,4,A Great Place to Relax After a Day Sightseeing,"We had a very comfortable stay and got great welcome at Earl's Regency.  Set slightly out of Kandy it is built into the mountains and spread over several levels.   Our room was across a bridge section from the main building and then an elevator ride to our floor.  The bedroom was nicely appointed with a lovely small furnished balcony off.  The only slight problems is the external tiled corridor which allows for a bid of noise into the rooms.  The breakfast and dinner (with live entertainment) were fabulous, although Tour Groups do make it a little busy at times.  There is a lovely outside dining area with an amazing view over a lawned area to the mountains.  We were on such a tight schedule that we did not get to appreciate the beautiful looking pool!",Couples

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",5,Santron weds Nisha - March 2025,"Radisson Blu hosted my (then fiancée, now wife) and me for our traditional Tamil Saiva wedding on the beach and our reception. They were nothing short of amazing. In the lead-up, we were quite anxious, having opted for only a partial wedding planner, but the team truly went above and beyond to accommodate our every need. From promptly pressing our clothes to ensuring I (the groom) was fed and hydrated throughout what felt like days of photoshoots, they handled everything with care and professionalism.

The rooms were spotless, and every request was met with efficiency. The team made this an unforgettable experience for us, and I will forever be grateful for how they brought our vision to life. A special thanks to the chefs for creating the most incredible food, catering to all our palates. I am not a big veg guy myself but the wedding menu Chef Singh prepared for us was truly mouthwatering, not to mention his breakfast dosas. I’m also extremely grateful to Angelo, Harsha, Dixon, Chamika and the entire team (including the front-of-house staff, whose names I may have missed-sorry!) for their warmth and hospitality. Not only were they brilliant hosts, but they also took the time to genuinely build connections with us. Their dedication was truly awe-inspiring, and I cannot praise them highly enough for alleviating any stress we had. Sajard also for helping get all of this over the line and regularly checking in with me throughout even whilst managing three locations.

A special shoutout to Asanka—the best pastry chef around!

Thank you all. We genuinely hope to see you again!

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,A Great Stay...But....,"We enjoyed our stay at the Radisson in Galle and  found it to be very relaxing.  
The room was clean and spacious and the super efficient and friendly pool staff ensured we had ample supplies of beach towels as we sat around the pool.

The dining was great, as were indeed the dining staff who were super efficient and friendly. However, my wife got bored of the Indian cuisine that was always on offer (although I loved it and thought it was superb!).

Two things we did not like. 

1. We paid for an all inclusive package (including drinks) but had to involve management early on when we were told by the bar staff that we had to pay for drinks outside of the restaurant, ie at the roof top terrace bar (which is stunning by the way) and the pool bar. Although this matter was quickly resolved, it was hassle we did not need.

2. We thought the pool staff were intimidated by a rowdy/noisy group of Polish and Russian guests who tended to monopolise, (and drink too much), in and around the pool and surrounding areas most afternoons. 

The hotel is located 10 minutes from Galle in a tuktuk which costs approx. USD5 each way so is well located. It took approx. two hours to travel by taxi each way to Colombo International Airport.",Couples

Galle,"Radisson Blu Resort, Galle",4,Lovely Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, but it was a shame we had issues with our room (2704) which was actually very nice with a sea view and overlooking the swimming pool. 

After going out we came back to a rather large puddle on the floor and water dripping from an air conditioning unit. This was dealt with and a very apologetic Housekeeping manager offered us an upgraded room - we gratefully declined as we were time constrained and wanted to spend our remaining time by the pool.  On our return from what is an exceptionally nice pool we found the room had no power - requiring another call to reception.

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. They were always ensuring our stay was absolutely pleasant which I have not experienced in any other hotel. Food was really really yum and the portion sizes were so filling. For each meal I was extremely full that I could go into a food coma. Thinking about it makes me hungry. The rooms were very comfortable and each room had a beautiful view of the mountains and lakes for miles and miles.

Colombo,Mirage Hotel Colombo,5,"""Work Hard and Be Nice To People"" is their motto and how they live up to it!!","We stayed two nights, separated by 10 days. Both stays were too short, the first one was coming from airport and leaving next morning on a bus, second coming in the evening by train and leaving at 4AM for the airport. Next time we hope to stay longer and really savour the experience. I am not sure how much we paid (tour group), but it was worth every penny and much more. Treated like family from the moment you get down from the bus. Excellent spacious rooms. Quick elevators. Enough power outlets. Bathroom was superlative. View of course!! Indian ocean across the road, rail track and beach. The 1st floor restaurant is all glass, looking out on the ocean. Excellent Buffet the first night and next morning. The second night, it was past 9pm and they gave us a Set Menu which was also excellent.  And when they found out we had to leave at 4AM they OFFERED to give us packed breakfasts, choice of veg or non-veg. Made fresh at 4AM, sandwiches, cup of fruit and a bottle of water. Everyone I said that to, said ""Wow! THAT is hospitality!"" Their motto is ""Work Hard and Be Nice to People"" and they really live up to that and more. We felt that we were leaving old friends, when we checked out. Really hope to be back. In some 60 years of wandering the planet, I cannot think of a handful of hotels that were this memorable. What would I want changed? Nitpicking here, but Vattalappam as I remember from the 1960s was less spongy, more coconut milk and jaggery flavor. Maybe time has distorted my memory, but that was one of my Must-Haves, and they had that as option the last night Set Menu. With the Buffet you don't have space on plate or tummy for much of this.",Couples

However the breakfast wasn't great (compared to other hotels) and the towels in both of our rooms were thin/threadbare. There was also a mix-up with our room type and the hotel staff handled it very poorly.

The rooftop pool is a highlight – it feels like you’re floating in the sky, surrounded by nature. The service was warm and attentive, and both the breakfast and dinner were excellent – flavorful local dishes served with a smile.

It’s only a short walk downhill to the center of Ella with its cozy cafés and shops, but be prepared for a steep climb back. Luckily, the hotel offers a convenient shuttle service during the day, which we happily used.

,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,2,Bird watching NOT safari. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"After reading reviews we decided to visit Yala national park with Mahoora but it was a complete waste of money. We had already visited an elephant sanctuary and saw 2 elephants driving to Yala so of course we really wanted to see a leopard. Obviously wild life is completely unpredictable but we had booked the exclusive safari package which other than your own private jeep means absolutely nothing. We paid 405 USD for a nights stay in a tent which had more animals than the park in it (including a big enough lizard), mediocre dinner where you couldn’t see what you were eating, disgusting breakfast and of course the “private” safari. Our “guide” didn’t even introduce himself so I don’t know his name which straight away gave me a bad vibe. He didn’t give much information about anything - we saw deer, rabbits and millions of birds but it’s nothing we can’t see at home for free. We spent 3 hours driving around bumpy roads for absolutely nothing. We got a tip about a leopard and there was about 50 other jeeps and we could barely see the leopard he was so far up in the tree but still can say we saw one atleast. We were so happy to be leaving after one night it was more than enough. As I said wildlife is unpredictable but I really wouldn’t recommend this and if you are tight on budget and considering skipping it do! We went to the elephant freedom project for 1/10 of the price and had a lovely day with so much interaction with elephants!",Couples
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,5,Great safari experience!,"We did the safari with Dilhara and Kasun and they were really great.

The tent was excellent. Cosy with everything we needed including an en-suite bathroom. In the evening the camp felt magical with all the lanterns lit up as did the evening dinner set up around the campfire.  

We did the full day safari which we didn’t regret seeing Elephants, deer, birds, buffalo and a Leopard with our guide and driver who were excellent. They went out of their way to ensure we saw as much as possible during the day. 

This is clearly a well managed safari camp and  we would highly recommend it.",Couples
,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,4,Two Nights Experience @ Mahaoora Yala.,"This was the second time that id was in a tented camp.The 1st with Mahaoora and it was a awesome experience . They were very professional in what they do.

 The food was very good Breakfast, Lunch, and a candle light BBQ dinner. The service was excellent and kind staff to attend tie your needs.
Mistake of all the two half day safaris that stolen the show. Being a wild life buffer the the Lepoard that i am after. We had  good sightings on both days. The Naturalist & the driver was very professional. The Naturalist gave me lots of info on the wild and its animals. 
I would advice any person to go with the Eco Team to have a awesome experience and your moneys worth.

Another thing, you do the safari with them, they are the best. They know a lot, the communicate between their jeeps and if one sees an animal, they take you there, this is an advantage. We were extremely lucky and where able to see a leopard, a dream come true. Besides that, you will see most of the animals in this reserve, and they are all majestic.",Friends
Kalutara,Tangerine Beach Hotel,5,Well recommended.,"One of my most enduring memories of the hotel will be the staff. Absolutely first class. You are greeted with smiles, warmth and treated like you are the only guests in the hotel.   The hotel  itself is older in style, right by the ocean, in large, well kept grounds.  Public areas are spacious and airy, with attractive Sri Lankan decor. The rooms ( we booked a deluxe for 4 weeks ) were attractive, ours was very comfortable. Nice bed linen and towels. Plenty of hot water,  good pressure in the shower and quality toiletries. Great facilities, large well maintained pool  with swim up bar and extensive sun bathing areas.  There are also indoor lounges and bar areas which offer evening entertainment, plus a spa.  The food was varied, always something we could eat -  good local fresh fruits;  huge range of salads;   hot western style food of all kinds;  amazing desert display plus delicious Sri Lankan and sometimes Indian specialty dishes. The location allows you to explore more of Sri Lanka.  We also wanted  a relaxing getaway from the colder European winter and it certainly delivered on that. There are a few local bars and shops close by.  The sea was quite wild when we were there and the sound of the waves against the shore was incredible.  We met many people who had stayed several times: which says it all really!",Couples

And last but least I need to recognize stuff. Everyone worked hard to make clients stay there enjoyable. Every piece of question or need was solved professionally. 
Big thanks to bar manager Prasad who was there for us from the very first day. Best manager I ever seen. Also big bow to the restaurant senior manager Ranil.

Kalutara,Tangerine Beach Hotel,4,lovely hotel just a shame about the weather,"We have just returned after spending a week at this lovely hotel where the staff worked very hard to make your stay an enjoyable experience. My birthday co-insided with our stay and the staff made a real effort in the room which really made it a special day and the evening meal was accompanied with a birthday cake and a burst of Happy Birthday a lovely touch indeed. Our room overlooked the pool and sea and despite the overcast conditions which were unexpected during our stay we managed to make the most of the facilities using the free half hour massage which was excellent though I did not get a chance to use the gym which was very well equipped indeed. Meals were generally quite good although the dining room was very busy at breakfast and dinner where there were little manners on show by many of the guests and the high expectation of the dress code I had read about prior to traveling was non-existent so do not worry about bringing too many pairs of long trousers guys as you will not need to wear them as I had expected! The room was very nice and spacious, you may need a few extra hangers but everything else is supplied and the room staff including the evening check by the housekeeping team was a nice touch were excellent and the room was kept to a very high standard ..well done! my only issue was the mattress which was very hard as I did not have a full nights sleep throughout the stay there though I did not complain as everything else was great. Entertainment at night was good but such a shame it was not better supported where the artists were excellent with possibly the exception of the magician. I must say we were pleasantly surprised to find we were allowed two glasses of wine each with our lunch and dinner a real bonus when we were not expecting this treat!

,Mahoora Tented Safari Camp Yala,4,Great stay with Raj & team,"Wonderful stay made comfortable and assuring by led by Mr Raj and the crew including Sagara & Manjula. Mr Raj was of great service and help by picking me at 4am in the morning from the gates in total darkness, he also assisted in checking me in early which allowed me to catch an early safari. He also arranged transport out of the camp by a local driver which was helpful. Much appreciated. Overall all the staff try their best to make guests comfortable. 

Safari was well guided and driven by driver Samantha and naturalist Dilhara, whom I spent most of my time with on private safari. Managed to spot leopards on some safaris but on others we couldn't spot any at all.

Areas to improve: at Big Game Camp, it was communicated that amenties include shower gel and shampoo but only shampoo was provided. As a guy, thats ok as we are more flexible, but for ladies it will matter more and if communicated, it should be provided. Daily meals were randomly switched between locations within the campsite as well, which made guests like myself confused too.",Solo

The tents themselves were fantastic. It's a real luxury to be able to have a decent shower and bed when your camping!
In terms of the safaris, we were very happy. We had a great driver and ecologist and had immediate access to the park so we didn't have to wait. As a bonus, our brilliant driver spotted a leopard for us (the first one seen for quite a while), so we were very happy!!

Regarding location, it was perfect for us because it was a short walk to Sigiriya Lion Rock, which is why we came to Sigiriya. 

After the hike, we had a super tasty breakfast at the hotel. We opted for the Sri Lankan breakfast and the chef actually came out to chat with my husband about his dietary restrictions and ensured he had something delicious for brekkie.

After breakfast we went into the pool, which was perfectly cool and in a shaded area. The pool area was clean and they provided towels on request. 

The room was beautiful and decorated in a classic SE Asian style. Very clean and tidy, and clearly well-kept.

The Ekho team were all super professional  and friendly; from the guard to reception to waitstaff and other team members, it was top notch customer service. This is supported by the fact that we had issues with our tuktuk and everyone without question came to help us out and get us safely on the road.

 Our room on the ground floor was immaculate  clean with a large bathroom and flowers on the bed a great touch. We were able to step out of our room through our balcony to a great pool ideal for cooling down on a hot sunny afternoon or watching children have fun swimming safely.There was even a swim up bar what more could you want
The sun loungers were siruated on grass with views of the sea and the palm squirrels running around kept us entertained while we rested
 The staff at this hotel from the delightful   guest relations  ladies with their candles and warm smiles  to the pool man  to all the waiters bar attendees cleaners and security  people  are a credit to the hotel stopping to chat  engage and inform us of this beautiful  country .No question we asked however stupid was  not answered  fully showing your culture to our hearts
It inspired us to go on several excursions and enjoy this beautiful place

You are sheer magic! I come to Galle Fort and the main reason is to be with you. You are an experience that I could not forget from the time I first came 2yrs ago and one night with you wasn’t enough. Thus, I came to you again and will again and again every time I visit Srilanka. If anyone wants to experience peak colonial era energy and vibes they must take refuge within your warm embrace in the avatar of your amazing hospitality, smiling staffs and most importantly the love that exudes from each of the stay . It is truly magical how you take one back to a different time. Each nook and cranny whispers a story of its own. In the bustling heart of the Peddler’s street you are a coveted space that gave so much peace to a hustler like me who earns your presence in difficult days. Thank you ❤️

A special thanks to the entire team of The Bartizan especially to Mr.Andrew who is their ever smiling , witty manager .

This boutique hotel is full of charm and character, offering an experience that far exceeds its rating.

We stayed in the Deluxe Ocean Front room, which was stunning. The room was spacious, the bathroom was modern and spotless, and the private balcony was the icing on the cake.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. They accommodated our early travel schedule by packing us a breakfast to-go on the first day and served breakfast on our balcony the next.

Whether it's the front desk or the 24/7 security guard, you're always greeted with a warm smile.

The shared oceanfront terrace offers a spectacular view of the sunset — a perfect place to unwind.

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,5,An original boutique hotel in a beautiful location,"We spent five nights at The Bartizan in February and really enjoyed our stay there. The location is perfect for exploring the vast fort and the lanes within it.
From the moment we arrived, Andrew the manager welcomed us and showed us to our room. He was helpful and gracious throughout our visit, always checking if we needed anything.
Our room was a quirky one at the top of a spiral staircase with a fabulous outside space, and even more fabulous views. The bed was very comfortable and the shower great with complimentary toiletries, not to mention a view of the lighthouse.
Breakfast was perfect and plentiful, a fruit plate, toast and bread rolls and a cooked choice as well. They even catered specially for my fussy choices!
We had such an enjoyable stay, we didn’t want to leave, so thank you Andrew and all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable.",Couples
Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,5,Outstanding Boutique Hotel within the Fort,"The Bartizan is a beautifully converted and decorated small hotel within the confines of Galle Fort.

The staff are fantastic- welcoming, friendly and committed to ensuring that their guests enjoy their stay. Highly recommended!",Couples
Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,1,Disappointing,"This was probably not the best choice of hotel for us. We expected a ""modern, stylish hotel"" as advertised on their website. Instead, our small courtyard room was as per the attached photos - walls had been polyfillered but not sanded or over-painted; the under sink cupboard was full of dirty old used water bottles. Perhaps the cracked concrete walls and floor are part of the charm but it was lost on us. We re-located to another hotel.",Couples
Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,4,A lovely setting for a 2-night stay.,"My room was the superior balcony room with a partial sea view.

Firstly, all the hotels within the city walls have a certain configuration so you may not have the usual benefits of other hotels. Nonetheless, our stay at the Bartizan was a relaxing one. Although we had a partial view of the sea, the view was still nice to have and hearing the waves at night was very smoothing for me personally. 

The room was spacious enough for 2 people. It is very dimly lit and no TV is within the room. No lifts as well but I believe the other hotels within walls have the same layout. Coffee and tea were complimentary alongside the items inside the mini-bar, which was helpful in terms of not having to always buy water. Our room had a AC unit and an overhead fan.

There was an option to have breakfast on our balcony, which we took and proved to be very convenient. The staff very quickly cleaned up once we gave them a call. The staff were always very friendly and courteous, even offering us an umbrella to shade us from the fierce heat. They helped us check in smoothly and were accommodating to our needs. Andrew (who I believe was the hotel manager) always greeted us whenever we entered or left the hotel alongside the other staff members.

Located really close to the sea, all the main sites and restaurants are easily reachable from the hotel. A section of the Galle walls is right outside the hotel, so you can start your walk of them straight away.

I had a lovely stay in Galle and would recommend the hotel if you are staying for a short period, or even using it as a base to cover other sites close by.",Family
Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,5,The perfect place to stay in Galle.,"Beautiful building and rooms. We had a large double with balcony facing the sea which was huge and fabulous.

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,5,Excellent!,"The Bartizan hotel Galle was a joy to stay in . We spent 3 nights there , we had a court yard room ,it was small but had everything  you could want it in. Very comfortable bed & pillows , spotless & comfortable , European 5 star standard the room even a hair dryer ! hand towels for taking off make up , nice touches like a full mini fridge with refreshments & treats . 
I feel we paid a fair price for the level of luxury of this hotel , many many others of this standard are a lot more expensive!!
The breakfast was very good ,staff go over & above at all times .

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,5,Our Favourite Hotel In Sri Lanka,"We loved our stay at The Bartizan Hotel, Galle Fort. Andrew, the manager is brilliant.
We stayed three nights and because we were staying in a small room we got upgraded on our last night.
Unlike alot of hotels in Sri Lanka, everything in the room works! Sockets, good shower, fridge stocked with free drinks etc and air-con that does not wake you up!!
Great breakfast, lovely staff and restaurant recommendations as well as advice on shops, tuc tuc etc.
We were overcharged in a shop in Galle and Andrew and staff went back to the shop with my wife to renegotiate the price!! That is the level of service at the Bartizan.
We would love to stay again and without reservations I would highly recommend. 😎",Couples

They helped me file a police complaint, stayed with me through the entire process, and never once made me feel like a burden. They gave me their time, energy, and kindness without expecting anything in return. Because of their incredible support, I actually got my phone back.

Don’t expect them to answer the phone if you visit on a really busy day like a long weekend, but they will make it up to you. Food is à la carte, but they don’t serve up to your room. Get a sea view room, because the view at sunset is heavenly.

First must say that this is not our kind of hotel, too grand and ostentatious, we prefer boutique hotels. 
With a gold-plated elephant in the Reception and gold-plated adornments around the lobby we knew that this would not be our first choice. But having said that, it still is a great hotel and obviously caters for meetings and conferences (luggage x-ray scanner is reception says it's not just a vacation hotel)

Room was equally decorated and fitted to a high standard.

We did use the very small pool but felt too busy with 6 people in it.

Restaurant was huge and ornate with a very large selection of very good, tasty food, with a guitarist playing during the evening.

Beruwala,Occidental Eden Beruwala,5,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff.","The Eden was our 7th & final hotel in our tour of Sri Lanka before we departed home. 

We arrived to a warm welcome by the staff. When we were shown to our room, we found it to be slightly dated & it felt like a bit of an anticlimax from what we’d been used to during our trip to Sri Lanka. 

We realised quickly that the bath/shower set up leaked all over the bathroom floor. I raised this with reception & asked to move rooms. We then received an upgrade & the upgraded room was brilliant, it was like a completely different hotel. The staff couldn’t have done any more for us with regards to resolving this issue. 

The upgraded room was spacious & immaculately presented. The food during our evening meals & breakfast was fantastic. 

It was great to wind down & relax around the pool area after 10 days of travelling. 

The beach area was accessible, but the beach is situated on the mouth of a river. Probably not the most hygienic to be swimming in, the sea is notoriously choppy a lot of the time with strong currents from the river so it was sensible not to go any further than a paddle.

Beruwala,Occidental Eden Beruwala,5,A Truly Unforgettable Experience at Eden Resort – Feels Like Coming Home again,"Every visit to The Eden Beruwala reminds me of the structure of the Captain's Bridge of the mighty Titanic or any large commercial vessel upon entering Eden Resort. This five-star establishment is truly remarkable, offering breathtaking views of the sea based on my observations. The resort is blessed with an eco-friendly environment and boasts a stunning beachfront surrounded by lush greenery, alongside the awe-inspiring sight of the beautiful sea and a hillside monastery that we enjoyed during our stay at Eden. 
The hotel lobby is impressive, spacious, and impeccably clean, presented in a highly attractive manner. The young team at the front office works diligently, and we must commend them for their professionalism, attention to detail, and willingness to assist at any time. We received a wonderfully warm welcome from the hotel staff, who ensured our comfort throughout our stay from the very first day at this lovely establishment. The treatment we received from the hotel team was exceptional, and the rooms assigned to us exceeded our expectations; they were beautifully presented, spotless, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. My partner required extra care during this trip, and the hotel team consistently ensured she felt happy and comfortable, helping even before we asked for it. In my personal experience, the resort team is truly a **GEM**. 
Thank you, Rohan, Yohan, and your exceptional team—an incredible group of individuals, professional in their roles and attentive to detail, always humble and kind. The remarkable aspect of this team is their ability to remember guest preferences, making it impressive to witness how they care for their guests at Eden; it is truly an extraordinary experience. 
The fantastic food and beverage team at the hotel acts and thinks in alignment with their operational leaders, demonstrating excellent training; they are incredibly friendly, professional in their service, polite, and always willing to help. The housekeeping team maintained our rooms in pristine condition and ensured the hotel lobby area was well-kept and spotless. The main restaurant, Garden of Eden/Sippi, a new dining venue, offers an outstanding selection of high-quality meals. We enjoyed Sri Lankan Lamp Rice at Sippi on our first night, which was delightful with generous portions; the food spread at the main restaurant during our repeated stay was consistently delicious. 
The dining area boasts a great atmosphere, with a positive vibe evident during meal times. The food is exceptional and served in a hygienic manner to all guests. I must emphasise that excellent vegetarian options were available for guests. The restaurant service was extraordinary, with staff members exhibiting exceptional attention to detail, all of whom were friendly and polite at all times. Once again, thank you to GM Rohan, his fantastic team Yohan, the wonderful front office staff, Suresh, and his charming food and beverage team, Chef Deepal, Viraj, and his terrific team of chefs, who treated us with kindness and politeness. 
The hotel staff were highly professional, caring, and attentive to detail at all times. The standout feature of this entire hotel team is their commitment to exceeding guest expectations, always ensuring you have a superbly relaxed and enjoyable experience.",Family

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,4,A great little hotel,"The Bartizan is situated right by the Rampart. Everything is easily accessible from the hotel.
Our room (a suite) was spacious and comfortable, and had a great view of the sea. Much could be done to improve the facilities in the room. For example, a table or two, a surface for the fridge (one has to bend down to the floor to use it), more hooks to hang towels and clothes in the bathroom, a deeper shelf in the bathroom on which one might place a toiletry bag, shaver and so on. There were enough plug points! No TV, which is a good thing! It would be good if the hotel obtained a liquor licence and stocked a bar. There is a great little roof terrace from where on can see the sunset.
The whole place could do with a lick of paint, and the damp patches could be treated. Generally, the place is in need of some loving care, but it is still charming. Minor touches and improvements will make a big difference. 
Breakfast in the courtyard was great. Fruit of all kinds to start with followed by a choice of what one preferred; continental, Sri Lankan. Plenty of restaurants nearby for lunch and dinner: the hotel does not provide any meals after breakfast.
The staff were all tremendous; they were friendly and most helpful. All the best to Andrew and the team. I am sure the recent arrival of Andrew will make a big difference, and the place will improve.",Couples

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,4,Lovely Boutique Hotel in Galle,"The Bartizan Hotel is ideally situated within the historic Galle Fort in Sri Lanka, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its prime location provides easy access to the fort's ramparts and Pedlar Street, which is just around the corner. This makes it convenient for guests to explore the charming streets and cultural attractions of Galle Fort.

The rooms at The Bartizan Hotel offer a pleasing blend of modern comfort and historic charm. Each room is tastefully decorated, featuring elegant furnishings and thoughtful details that reflect the rich history of Galle. We stayed in a suite with a private balcony overlooking the ocean, providing a serene and picturesque setting. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. However, the air conditioner struggled to keep the room cool during the warm nights.

The hotel does not have a traditional restaurant, but a courtyard area with café tables serviced by a competent team in the kitchen. The food offers a delightful dining experience with a focus on fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Despite the lack of a formal restaurant, the culinary offerings were impressive and thoroughly enjoyable.

The service at The Bartizan Hotel is wonderful. The staff are warm, friendly, and go out of their way to ensure that every guest feels welcome and well taken care of. From personalized recommendations for local attractions to thoughtful touches throughout our stay, the level of hospitality was outstanding.

The Bartizan Hotel offers a unique and memorable experience in the heart of Galle Fort. The combination of its historic charm, luxurious accommodations, and outstanding service makes it a standout choice for anyone visiting Galle. Highly recommended for a truly special stay in a remarkable location.",Family

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,4,👍👍,"We stayed one night at the bartizan.. the hotel has lovely vibes , and is a great place to stay . It’s walking distance from all the restaurants, hardly a 2 min walk. Also it’s across the street from where u can walk/ view the ocean so location is brilliant. 
Our room was really spacious and well kept. Only suggestion I would have for them is to put another smaller air conditioner in the section with the 2 other beds as it’s quite hot there, coz ac air doesn’t reach. The balcony is of a nice size and loo is 👍👍
The breakfast was super. You have to order when u reach so that they can have it ready morning. It’s a small operation it seems..
A good thing to note is that once the kitchen is shut then there’s literally nothing for u to eat, which means by 4pm I think.. u need to get it from outside. They did say they serve lunch but I’m really not sure..
That said, it’s very very close to all the restaurants so manageable .
Would definitely stay here again ..",Family

Galle,The Bartizan Galle Fort,4,Charming property in good location.,"We stayed three nights here whilst touring. The property is boutique with some charm and very well located in the old town. We were kindly upgraded to balcony room with seaview which was appreciated. Room was quirky, huge and well equipped, only thing missing was a tv but that did not trouble us. Staff were friendly and helpful and it was nice to be offered breakfast on our balcony. I even managed a couple of swims on little beach opposite the hotel. 
Only downside was that the property is popular for wedding/fashion photoshoots in the courtyard (where guests eat) and turret beside our room, and there were several such over our stay which we found intrusive. I was told this started over covid restrictions to bring in cash, which is understandable, but then continued. Seems like owners are selling the same small facilities twice.",Couples

The hotel features a lovely rooftop poolside restaurant, perfect for relaxing with a drink or enjoying a peaceful dinner with a view.

The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and always ready to help—true Sri Lankan hospitality. One small area for improvement is the response time when calling the main operator (dialing 0); it sometimes took two or three calls to get through.

Breakfast was also enjoyable, offering a good variety of international and local cuisines.

The gardens are just beautiful, and we were lucky enough to wake early and wander down to watch the sunrise. It was calm, quiet, and absolutely breathtaking, a moment we won’t forget. I also joined the morning yoga session, which was such a refreshing way to start the day.

Dinner was delicious, amazing local Sri Lankan cuisine fresh, full of flavour, and made even better knowing so much of it came from their own garden.

Our room was private, spotless, and super comfortable. And then there’s the view… wow. Spectacular doesn’t even come close. You could sit and stare for hours.

Amazing service all day long. The staff is always smiling with a friendly atmosphere and helpful tips to explore this gem of an area.  The first night at dinner had a fantastic flute player who had a wide array of flutes from around the world. Rooms are clean and have a unique train station theme. Room 105 was perfect.

What stood out just as much as the view was the service...5-star care in a boutique hotel. Seni, the manager, was always present but never intrusive. He ensured even the smallest details—like getting the coffee just right—were handled with precision.

Priyatha at the front desk checked in on us throughout the stay, making sure everything ran smoothly. And Sjwani, who served us daily, truly went the extra mile. My wife’s vegetarian meals were made exactly to preference, and baby food was thoughtfully arranged without reminders.

A special mention to Mr. Kavindu, who went above and beyond during our stay—when my partner injured his foot upon arrival, he was the first to offer first aid and continued to check in on us throughout our two-day visit. It truly felt like being cared for by family.

The hotel photos online are also very accurate, and we were genuinely impressed by the cleanliness and high standards when we checked in. This hotel feels like a home away from home—highly recommended!",Couples
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,A hidden gem,"Waking up to the most wonderful view of the waterfall - talk about a room with a view. Beautiful hotel - excellent service from a warm and wonderful staff.
Onrock is one of those hidden gems that you discover almost by chance - a real diamond, never to be forgotten.",Couples
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Great! With a beautiful view!,"Beautiful rooms with an astounding view at the mountains. Be sure to check out the sunrise early morning. 

Also great breakfast with a lot of options. Friendly staff. Located in a narrow street, but walking distance from the main street with plenty of shops and restaurants, which is fun to walk around.",Family
Ella,Hotel Onrock,3,Not recommended for families with kids,"The views are realy nice and the rooms are ok for 1 night, but the toilet is not well maintained with broken fixtures. There is no phone in the room to call for assistance, no room service so if you arrive late there is no opportunity to eat. Staff are not very friendly or helpful. Not recommended for families.",Family
Ella,Hotel Onrock,4,Thanks to the staff!,"Kavindu who works at réception made our stay exceptionally great. His smile, help, friendliness, professionalism, ad Ice, information really deserve to be mentioned. 
The hotel itself we found a little too expensive for what it s worth, but besides this no complaints whatsoever.
The staff does everything to make your stay unforgettable.",Friends
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Great base in Ella,"Lovely hotel, with the friendliest and most helpful staff. Great view from the balcony in our room. It is up a very steep hill, so we did use tuktuks up and down to the town, I've hurt my knee, but it is walkable if you are fit. Just missing a pool which is currently being built on the roof so will then be perfect. Spotlessly clean and the food choice at breakfast was good. The manager/concierge was particularly helpful planning a day with a tuktuk around the sights of Ella that I would be able to manage, he also recommended some amazing places to eat in town.",Couples
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,"Relaxing and quiet, great location",Hotel Onrock is the perfect place to stay in Ella if you want to be nearby the action but not staying in the middle of the excitement. Just a short walk up the hill from the main drag it has comfortable rooms (with balconies!) and exceptional customer service. The team in the bar/dining room were attentive and provided us everything we wanted. Manager Kavindu Madan was an amazing host and guided us in the right direction for both food locations in town as well as activities to not miss. Definitely the place to stay when visiting Ella!,Couples
Ella,Hotel Onrock,4,Good and comfortable hotel,"Nice hotel with spacious and comfortable rooms. Modern touch/interior (luxury room)

Ella,Majentra Ella,5,"Helpful Staff, Stunning Views, and a Peaceful Stay – Manjentra Hotel, Ella","We had a lovely stay at Manjentra Hotel in Ella. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind, always going out of their way to make us feel welcome. The garden was beautifully maintained, and you could see the care and effort that goes into keeping the surroundings so peaceful and inviting.

A big thank you to the young lads who drove us up and down the driveway — they were always patient, friendly, and reliable. The hotel is a little set back from the main road, so it's worth allowing about 15 minutes each way, but the team were always happy to assist with transport, which made it easy.

The views from the hotel were absolutely stunning, offering a tranquil escape and a perfect place to unwind.

As we were leaving, the team surprised us with some fresh bananas from their garden — such a thoughtful gesture, and they were absolutely delicious. A small touch that summed up the warmth and hospitality of our stay.

If you're after a peaceful stay with great service, natural beauty, and genuine care, Manjentra Hotel is a wonderful choice.",Couples
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,A Wonderful Hidden Gem,"A brand new hotel with stunning views of the whole mountain, beautiful cabins with luxury detailing, delicious food carefully prepared and wonderful staff that go above and beyond. Far enough out of town to feel like you are the only person in the mountains, and staff help with transport. Will definitely come back.",Friends
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,A GEM!,"We had an amazing experience at this lovely hotel! From the moment we arrived, we were charmed by the greenery surrounding the property, felt like stepping into a peaceful paradise. It even rained heavily on our first day, which added to the charm and made the scenery even more magical the next morning.
The bungalow was spacious of 2 stories, comfortable, and beautifully designed. There are only four bungalows on the property, which makes the atmosphere very private and serene. 
What really stood out was the team running the place. Though small and long working hours, they were super friendly, attentive, and professional. Everything from check-in to meals was handled with such care.
Speaking of meals, the food was delicious! Every dish we had was fresh and full of flavor. they do breakfast on tray basis and not buffet since the number of guest are limited. They call you the night before to ask on the type each person would like to order.",Family

Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Breakfast with a view,"Tucked away at the end of a bumpy road outside Ella is the hidden gem Majentra Ella. This small scale lodge has by far the best view from your breakfast table. The cabins are clean and are equipped with good beds, private balcony and a bathroom (with bubble bath!) all rocking the same fantastic panorama. We specifically want to thank Mathis and Ranjith for their wonderful service and lovely food. And special thanks to Kalpa for the safe driving during the heavy rain.  Absolutely beautiful place and 100% recommendable for families.",Family

Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Book Now !,"A wonderful boutique hotel, with views that want to make you scream that it's great to be alive.
All the staff were excellent, but a particular nod to the chef who created bespoke vegan dishes to satisfy our diet.
The only minor issue was the access road...a real bone shaker, but I would accept that every day due to the combination of the outstanding friendly service, and the remote and peaceful location that would await the end of each journey.",Couples
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Place and food fantastic,"Peace, quiet & nature. A beautiful place tucked away from the world, just what we need after a busy couple of days! Recommend half board, we’ve just had the set menu and it was delicious and nothing was too much trouble, changing from a fish curry to chicken and a double helping of ice cream - Thankyou",Couples
Ella,Majentra Ella,4,Beautifully remote in the mountains,"It feels slightly harsh only giving a 4* because the hotel itself was pretty flawless. 

The rooms were spacious and comfortable with a beautiful view, peaceful and in the cabins, it felt like you were the only people in the mountains. 

The restaurant was stunning, staff attentive and food delicious. It was particularly special for breakfast. We enjoyed the variety of Sri Lankan and international cuisines. 

The pool was also very stylish and clean but it is down quite a few steps so be prepared! 

However, the a main downfall was the access road - about 15 minutes along a very bumpy track from the main road. There is a shuttle van which hotel staff are happy to take you back and forth to the main road but this does make it feel slightly restrictive as you can’t pop out and grab a Tuk Tuk! In the van it is more comfortable but in a pre arranged Tuk Tuk or regular taxi it is quite uncomfortable. It is personal preference whether the remoteness is worth it or you want more things to do from the doorstep. 

We can not fault the staff and overall enjoyed our stay very much.",Family
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. What a beautiful hotel! We loved the Sri Lankan breakfast on the terrace, overlooking the mountains and tea plantations. The staff was very caring and attentive, and our bungalow had plenty of space for the four of us. Thanks a lot!",Family
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Very close to Sri Lankan nature !,"An excellent experience - as close to the nature as it could be ! 
The garden is all organic and we got fresh fruit as a present when we were leaving which was so nice! 
The  room was very comfortable with such a beautiful view.!  You could hear the nature from your balcony . 
A delightful restaurant and delicious food and perfect service!

Wish we could stay longer !",Family

Loved our stay,Family
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,Relaxation at its best,"If peace and tranquility is what you are searching for, staying at Majentra Ella is a must. Set in wonderful surroundings, with only the sounds of the birds and animals, it’s a perfect spot to relax and enjoy Ella. The bungalows are decorated beautifully and have well placed mood lighting to set a relaxing atmosphere. The views from each picture window is simply wonderful. The hotel grounds have flowers, fruit trees and greenery lining the  pathway to the pool and bungalows. 

The food was excellent, the staff were helpful and friendly. What a perfect stay!!",Couples
Ella,Majentra Ella,5,"Highly recommend for a peaceful, scenic retreat","This hotel is an absolute gem. Located just outside Ella, it offers a peaceful, scenic retreat with stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The spacious rooms are beautifully designed, and the bathroom with a jacuzzi overlooking the landscape is a standout feature. The service is top-notch, with friendly and professional staff who go above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. The pool, perfectly positioned with panoramic views, is an ideal spot to relax. The food is exceptional, and the surrounding area is rich in wildlife, offering opportunities to spot various birds and animals (cute little squirrels). I highly recommend this hotel for anyone seeking a tranquil getaway. I know it is a new hotel and I can definitely see it in the future becoming a very popular stay and I hope to stay here next time we visit Sri Lanka again!",Couples
Ella,Majentra Ella,4,A dream location but......,"Arrived at night so it wasn't until morning that I could take in the stunning views. The hotel is in an amazing location and I was able to watch the sunrise from my balcony. Breakfast was amazing and I felt spoilt with the service.  Hotel staff were amazing and I was offered drinks on my balcony one afternoon but a delightful young waiter. 
But, location is  quite remote and 10 minutes down a rough track, I relied on the hotel shuttle to take me to meet my driver and so felt a little restricted. Also I wasn't in a chalet but took the twin room next to reception which was lovely except it was at times a bit noisy from kitchen below and reception.  As it's a small property the restaurant issued a daily 4 course evening menu with 2 choices per course, disappointed with the options as would have preferred a more traditional Sri Lankan menu rather than the western choices, I couldn't eat one meal as the steak was so tough, luckily I wasn't too hungry that night but did have to let the staff know. I do hope that in time the hotel adds a bar above reception as there was a lack of social space of an evening.",Solo

Kandy,Mahaweli Reach Hotel,1,Worst order placed online,"Ordered a biriyani and it has to be one of the worst biriyanis. The chicken was clearly cooked days ago dry, tough, and absolutely lifeless. The rice was stale, the spices were barely there, and to top it off, the watapapam tasted old and chewy like it had been reheated multiple times. For over Rs. 12,000, I expected a rich, aromatic biriyani not something that tastes like it came from the back of a forgotten fridge. Save your money and your taste buds. Never ordering this again.

Kandy,Mahaweli Reach Hotel,3,"Great food, facilities but rooms need renovation","Stayed two nights here with family of four in connecting rooms as part of a bigger group of 14.   The hotel would have been impressive in its prime, but the rooms definitely need an update. Food for breakfast and dinner was great spread and quite tasty - commendation to the chef and food staff. Pool was picturesque and refreshing to swim in. Location was quite good and convenient for travel across the major attractions. Staff were accomodating and receptive to our requests. 

Rooms were comparable with 3 star establishments - with some damages on floor, tv channels not working properly and bathroom straight from 80’s. Even the doors seemed to not close unless pulled very hard.  Please look to expedite the room renovations - as we stayed in 6 5 star hotels across Sri Lanka on our trip - and this hotel was unanimously the least favourite due to the rooms. 

If the rooms can be addressed, I think hotel has all the right ingredients for success well into future.",Family

Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Good stay,Nice hotel.  Staff was great!  We had 2 rooms next to each other for our family of 4.  Comfortable beds and hot showers. Location is good.  Up a steep hill which gives you nice views of Ella. Restaurant nice and offers a good breakfast. Would recommend.,Family
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Hotel with a view in Ella,We were a family of six and stayed for one night. The hotel is newly renovated and had very nice and fresh rooms. It was situated with a marvellous view over the surroundings. We could see the sunrise from our rooms which was great. The hotel staff were very friendly and service minded. We had a good quality and well tasting dinner and breakfast at the hotel.,Family
Ella,Hotel Onrock,4,Beautiful views over Ella Rock.,"This hotel is set up a very steep hill which is worth the climb for the views from your balcony over Ella Rock and Little Adam’s Peak.  Staff were very friendly and hospitable with special mention to Kavindu who was particularly friendly.  Contrary  to some other reviews, we thought breakfast was excellent with a good choice of buffet options and then an egg option which could be ordered.  Our room was a in need of updating and lacked certain basics such as a chair or hooks and a wardrobe which you could actually hang clothes in .  The bathroom was a decent size but had a tiny shower in the corner and the window had wire for a handle.  Overall we enjoyed our stay here.",Family
Ella,Hotel Onrock,3,"Great location, OK Hotel",This hotel has nice views of the mountains and the location enables you to walk to the main street (up a very steep hill).  The bed was comfortable. A little tired and in need of an update. One night we had dinner here and we were the only ones there. Service was not great (After 10 minutes I had to ask for a menu). The food wasn’t very nice. Breakfast was however quite good.,Friends
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Beautiful place,"I had an amazing stay at this hotel. The food is really good. The room is  clean, spacious and wonderful view. All staff members were good and friendly especially kavindu. He was very helpful and assigned a good tuktuk driver who took me everywhere.",Solo
Ella,Hotel Onrock,4,"Solid hotel, international standard, in a backpacker town","This was overall a solid hotel, very modern and clean. I would say a solid 3 stars by international standards, something like a solid and clean Holiday Inn in the middle of a backpacker town. Located minimally outside, maybe 300 meters walking down a hill to the center of the town (with bars and restaurants). Breakfast was OK, nothing overwhelming like in the bigger resorts, but OK. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would go there again",Solo
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,"Yes, the view is great!","This hotel trades off the views which are undoubtedly quite lovely. My room was clean, and bed very comfortable. Overall, this is all very acceptable and the staff are excessively helpful and attentive which can't be faulted.

The location is very good albeit up a steep hill from the main street thronging with restaurants.

There are some challenges that would, otherwise, make this a luxury experience... selecting TV channels on the two remotes is clunky; there is no chair in the room other than a beanbag, so lounging on the bed is the only option; there's no luggage stand, so leaving open luggage on the floor is not ideal with occasional creepy crawlies around; the light switch is not within reach of the bed; the hot water for the shower never gets beyond tepid which is ok given the hot weather; shower gel and soap is limited to one small plastic bottle and a tiny hand soap which doesn't compare to modern luxury hotels offering refillable shower and hand gel; drinking water is limited to two small bottles during your stay unless you ask for more (they are very accommodating).

So, while this independent hotel is lovely and welcoming, and a cut above most local options in Ella, it's not quite a polished luxury experience if that's what you're expecting. Overall I'd recommend Hotel Onrock as a great Ella option though.",Solo
Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,Prime location with stunning views,"The hotel has stunning views with large modern rooms clean and comfortable
but be prepared for a bit of a climb to get there. If you’re carrying heavy luggage or not a fan of steep walks, it might be a challenge. we walked down for dinner and used tuktuk on every trip back up.  Basic Breakfast was included But you probably better opt for nicer selection on the restaurants on the main street. The staff were friendly and accommodating many thanks to Kavindu who was super helpful and attentive 
price is a bit on the high end but that's what you pay for prime location. we will defiantly recommend this place to our friends",Family

Ella,Hotel Onrock,5,"Shout out to Tharindu, Kavindu and Ajay - What great hospitality!","Great location - the hotel is on an uphill road just minutes from Ella Town. Rooms were cosy and had a great view of the Ella Gap [Ella Rock and Mini Adam's Peak] - so we suggest getting superior rooms. We loved the hospitality of Tharindu, Kavindu and Ajay - they were great in giving us tips to make the most of our trip and just being wonderful overall. The breakfast buffet didn't have a massive spread, but it was good, and the ala carte options were great. We hear they will add a pool soon so that's a plus when visiting next time.",Family

Room was clean with a light airy feel and did not contain heavy furnishings. Bed was definitely comfortable and if anything else was needed they would have provided it when asked. You could easily stay in this room for a few nights and not be cramped.
Breakfast was simple but had variety. Eggs cooked to order which was nice.

In particular, Kavindu was exceptional, made us feel at home, no job was too big for him! He was also our photographer when we were leaving the hotel.

This is a new hotel, around 4 years old. Upon arrival, the manager showed us different rooms and accommodated our request of a room close to our friends. Dinner and breakfast was also lovely. Absolutely comfortable beds and pillows allowed for a much needed refreshing sleep, which showed in our photos the next morning! Bathroom had standard amenities, and the view from the rooms were stunning, with a view of Mount Ella. Would definitely recommend!",Friends

Large rooms done up very tastefully, with all the bells & whistles you'd expect from a Jetwing Hotel. Nice integration of tiles as well in the exterior design facade of the hotel.

They have a nice roof top pool & bar, restaurant at the lobby level and in house spa.
Good spread for breakfast & helpful doormen as well.

Then again, later in my stay, he went the extra mile by assisting with a special request that most would have considered outside their scope. He handled everything with a warm, professional attitude that made me feel genuinely valued as a guest.

The best feature is the rooftop infinity pool - perfect for getting away from the noise and stress of Colombo.  But also the food is great - very flavourful, and with a wide selection.  They managed our food allergies (gluten and dairy) really well - but make sure you explain very clearly, as some of the staff have limited English.  If you also have food allergies, ask to complete the relevant form when you arrive.  They will then pass the relevant information on to the two restaurants.  

If you're travelling as a family, the two room suite is perfect.  There is a living room and kitchen included.  The price is really reasonable if you book in advance.",Family

The location is absolutely wonderful, right opposite the Galle Fort walls, and with views over the ocean. It's also just a short walk to all the action on Pedlar St. 

The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, however, they're starting to feel their age a little. Additionally, the AC isn't powerful enough to cool the entire room (we stayed in a larger suite), so at times it was quite hot. 

The breakfast is exceptional, with  Sri Lankan and Western options available, and three courses presented. They also went above and beyond for our toddler, providing pancakes and fruits.

The location of the property once you are there is fantastic from the rooms you can see literally just your mother nature and nothing else 
The room itself was fantastic as well because they have two stories in umbrella and hence can easily accommodate up to 6 guess very very easily. We were a family of three travelling and hence we had an amazing time. 
The food was very elated to our Taste, but and any modifications that we required were adhere to it 
They also provide classes for cooking cinnamon cutting and dirty tasting. We actually took the cinnamon cutting glass and absolutely loved it. Highly recommended for everyone. 
The staff is super courteous and ensure that guests are very well looked after 

Negatives 
Entering the place on your own can be very confusing and you also have to note that it’s about 5 to 10 minutes away from the main road for which they do provide pick and drop service all the time without any problem however to expect the road to be super bumpy

The staff? Absolutely amazing and hardworking. I couldn’t believe the roles we saw one person do. Front desk, restaurant server, housekeeping, guiding tours, I'm sure there was more. They were on it and all with such warmth and professionalism. Seriously impressive.

The food was fantastic. Beautiful presentation, was priced reasonably, and had such fresh, local flavors. You can tell the chef is passionate about what they do. My only small suggestion? With how chilly it gets in the evenings and all the amazing local tea and spices around, they could add some freshly made hot drinks to the menu. A good spiced tea or rich, decadent hot cocoa would be such a cozy bonus.

I’ll definitely be back. This place is worth every penny. I highly recommend it.

The property is very new, clean and well designed. It’s a bit further out of Ella, which makes it a quiet and relaxed experience. It’s more boutique rather than a large chain, but still high-end. There aren’t many other options like this around Ella. Would highly recommend.",Couples

Negombo,Hotel J Negombo,5,Great value for money. Repeat customer for a decade!,"Great value for money, central in beach front Negombo. 

I first came her when the pictured palmtrees were planted and 1 ft high, more than 10 years ago. Since that day my collegues and I always stay in Hotel J during our 3-4 monthly business trips. Which means I already spend more than 200 nights here!

Hotel J is the budget formula of the Jetwing group, a large hotel and leisure group with many sites in Sri Lanka. When we travel we often stay in other (more expensive) Jetwing Hotels as well.

As business travellers we like the clean rooms, friendly staff, safe environment, good breakfast and the relaxed veranda. The ocean dip is a daily routine after a hard days work. 

The hotel also has a nice rooftop bar, often visited by groups of British youngsters who start their Sri Lanka journey here. 

If you look for  relaxed start or finish of your Sri Lankan holiday at very affordable rates I can highly recommend Hotel J.",Business

The room wasn’t clean. 
No shampoo or body wash in the shower but only a soap bar.

The room was really noisy.

You will not have you bottle of water because they explained us that it’s plastic free hotel.

BUT if you don’t have your own bottle, you will have to but there one that….. is made of plastic.
So, what’s the meaning of plastic free?

Would definitely come back and recommend others too. Overall wonderful experience!!!",Family
Kandy,Mahaweli Reach Hotel,1,I do not recommend this place to anyone,"I’m extremely disappointed with the cake I ordered from Mahaweli Reach Hotel – Asiri Hospital Kandy outlet. The strawberries on top were moldy, which is completely unacceptable—especially from a brand with such a strong reputation in Sri Lanka.

This cake was a gift for someone very special, and I was honestly embarrassed when she pointed out the spoiled fruit. I placed the order 4 days in advance, trusting in their quality and standards.

After I raised a complaint, the staff member I spoke to tried to defend the brand by giving false explanations, insisting that it wasn’t their fault. She wasn’t unprofessional in her manner, but she clearly gave misleading information to protect the hotel's name—without understanding how their own online ordering system works or even acknowledging the timing of my purchase. None of what she said aligned with the facts. It felt like they were just trying to push the blame onto me rather than taking any responsibility.

So please be cautious if you're buying food from this hotel. In my experience, they do not genuinely consider the customer's side—they only defend their position, no matter what happens to you.

I do not recommend this place to anyone.",Solo

At first sight we thought  it was just another International - style modern hotel, of the type you can find anywhere in the world, but we were mistaken! 

What sets it apart are the restaurant food (some of the best I have had anywhere in the last few years) but most importantly the staff. From the welcome at the front desk, to service in the main restaurant and the rooftop bar, everybody we dealt with was outstanding; friendly, professional, and thoughtful. A particular mention must go to Vimukthi, Manisha and Asitha for their friendliness and professional service in the restaurant, and also to the chef, whose name I don't know, and the kitchen staff, for preparing such excellent food, beautifully presented and cooked perfectly.

My wife enjoyed her baked Barramundi dish which was perfect! Special mention should be made of F & B Manager Sunil who personally went around all the dinners on the roof terrace  to check if everything was OK with their dinners. He even recommended to us one of the  Hotel's signature cocktails ""Ward Seven "" whose recipe was excellent, and  I could not resist a second drink ! ,  to wash down the beef tenderloin smoothly.

The room was comfy, good sized bed. There were some food marks on the carpet from previous guests. There’s a great rooftop/pool area, the city is so smoggy but incredible to see from so high up. My main ‘con’ were the staff on the top floor. We got the vibe when we arrived there for drinks that they didn’t welcome the children upstairs. Regardless, we stayed for food and drinks but nobody was really very friendly or approachable. We stayed there for quite a while having a few courses and playing board games with our children but the general tone did not shift.
The hotel is conveniently placed and we would stay again if it formed part of the trip, I’m personally not in a rush to go back to Colombo.",Family

We found the food rather expensive for what it actually was. It was okay, however nothing special and in my opinion, not worth the price charged. I understand there is a premium for being in the capital, however still felt it slightly on the pricey side for what you get. 

Would stay here again, though.",Couples

But the development of kitchen and food as well as the mastermind behind destroyed the overall good experience there.
You wait more than an hour for your dinner on the roof top. The design of the food makes it impossible to eat it comfortable. The breakfast serves every day kiribat and pittu which no local family would eat daily. My special request for something different when stay the longer was simply ignored.

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Our amazing stay at DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila from 21st to 23rd May 2025,"We were a total of 3 Pax in our party and have nothing but the highest words of praise for our much appreciated and greatly enjoyed 2 ½ days that we spent at “DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila”. 

This was my second time at this Resort and for a property that must be 4 to 5 years old, I must say that the Hotel Buildings, both inside and outside, are beautifully maintained, as are the surrounds, almost as if every blade of grass or leaf of a tree has been placed in position with an artful eye.

After a morning start from Colombo, we were warmly welcomed upon our arrival, by GM Dayan Nawagamuwa, Executive Chef Nisanka Alawatta and the rest of the warm and friendly Double Tree Team who spared no pains to make certain that Service Standards, whether at mealtimes or otherwise, left nothing wanting. 

Our Rice & Curry Lunch was simply delicious ! Executive Chef Alawatta was in personal attendance in the Dining Area to make certain of the satisfaction of every guest and we observed his presence even during Breakfast Service times.  

We made an early afternoon start for the Yala National Park and although our Game Drive was not especially successful, we enjoyed being back at the Hotel to shower and change before enjoying a glass of Red Wine and Dinner which we opted to have served in the beautifully situated “Redshank” Dining area on the topmost floor. 

Our choice of “Lagoon Prawn” for the Main Course was proven to be the right one with presentation of the Dish itself being as artistically appealing to the eye as the most attractive colour poster of this Prawn Dish well positioned in the Ground Floor Lobby to catch one’s eye as one moved towards the Dining Area. 

Two Breakfasts later, we were amply reassured that the Kitchens of the Double Tree, served up only the best, be it in terms of variety, quality, taste, flavour and presentation, whatever the item that was on offer on the ample Buffet or A’ la Carte Menu.

We enjoyed every moment of our Stay at Double Tree and vowed to ourselves that we would soon be back !

If there was one negative or irritant that we kept encountering, that was the design of the Cutlery in use at Double Tree. We found the balance of the Cutlery to be such as to render their use both awkward and impracticable. In a property where every little detail has seemingly to have received such careful attention to detail, including the Guest Rooms and Public areas, the issue with the Cutlery stood out as a short-coming which has somehow inexplicably been missed in the overall attention to achieving 100% Customer Satisfaction.

I wish Double Tree by Hilton Weerawila and the Management of this fine Property continued success in every aspect of the Planning and Management of this high quality 5-Star Resort Property.

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Must visit,"We stayed here for two nights with my family and truly enjoyed every moment of our stay. A huge thank you to Kulunu – he embodies what real hospitality means. In today’s world, many focus solely on service, forgetting the heart of hospitality. Kulunu reminded us of that through his genuine care, going beyond textbooks and standard procedures.

We also want to thank Sneha for arranging our Yala tour – her communication was excellent and everything was perfectly organised. A shoutout to Thilaksho as well, who assisted us during check-in and made the process smooth.

The property itself is stunning – clean, modern, and beautifully maintained. We highly recommend doing the Yala tour from here; it was well priced, and they handled everything from hotel pickup to drop-off seamlessly.

While we didn’t try the seafood restaurant, we did try both the breakfast and dinner buffets. The breakfast was good, but we found the dinner buffet disappointing – the food wasn’t very tasty and didn’t offer great value compared to other hotels. On our second night, we opted to eat upstairs casual dining  outlet  and it was so good – super tasty food at a great price! And super good cockatiels too.

The pool is absolutely mind-blowing, and the entire property offers everything you could need – it’s a place where you could easily spend an entire week without wanting to leave.

The only issue we encountered was with the coffee. As coffee lovers, we found it hard to get a good cup – which seems to be a wider issue across Sri Lanka. I had one unfortunate experience where I ordered an iced latte and received a cold brew instead. The staff member didn’t seem to know the difference, and I had to show a picture from the internet. When I explained, he simply said, “This is how we make it.”

Aside from that minor issue, our stay was exceptional, and we would definitely return. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!",Family

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,4,"Great stay, and even better cookies!","We chose this hotel for the Yala leg of our journey in Sri Lanka. Although it’s about 40 minutes from Yala National Park, not the closest option, it was definitely the best in terms of value for money. Since we had to leave early for our safari, the hotel thoughtfully prepared a packed breakfast for us, complete with water and a juice box, which was a lovely touch.

I stayed two nights and had a great experience overall. The hotel upgraded our room and was very accommodating when I requested to switch to one with a better view. While the room and amenities were comfortable, they did feel a bit dated, which was surprising given the hotel opened in 2020. That said, it didn’t detract from the quality of the stay.

The spa was wonderful with great massage options and the staff there were kind and warm.

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Very good in every aspect,"It fulfilled our expectations serving our desires very well. The location by the Weerawila lake was excellent with a panoramic view of the lake. Cool breeze constantly blowing across the lake was making the environment very pleasant even though the temperatures were rather high during this time of the year in Sri Lanka. Water in the pool was warm getting heated by the high solar radiation but towards the evening it became a very comfortable warmth for us to enjoy the swim in the pool when the outside temperatures have dropped making the area relatively cool. Surroundings of the pool was extremely pleasant with old trees what resembled to be “Malitta” (Woodfordia fruiticosa) having beautifully gnarled trunks providing ample shade to the wooden decks. Poolside bar ""Hornbill"" was ideal to enjoy a cocktail while chilling in the pool. 

The welcome drink served with the fresh chocolate chip cookie was delicious. We found the room to be very comfortable and liked the interior decorations with drawings of branches of their iconic Rajawarna tree. Red Shank restaurant at the roof top which offered an a-la-carte menu was our choice for dinner and the dinner was excellent. Specially the Chicken liver pate and bouche were for our appreciation. Roof top bar and the restaurant was very quiet and conducive for a relaxing meal with cocktails. 

The breakfast layout in the Spoonbill restaurant was extensive. Interior was like entering the rib cage of a whale full of eats and drinks. Choice was enormous from Western to Indian, Sri Lankan to Eastern. It was indeed a promising layout with a good spread. Service was great!  We had an encounter with a tree frog which has crept into the bath area and settled on the water spout completely hidden but falling down when the tap of the spout was opened. After all we were in the ancient animal kingdom and it was a minor issue as we were able to get a room attendant to take it out unharmed and release it to the compound.",Friends

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Peaceful and relaxing stay with older kids,"I highly recommend this hotel, we stayed at various (some much higher end) hotels during our recent break and this was our kids favourite. It is an extremely relaxed resort with beautifully maintained surroundings. We had two rooms as our children are now 12+ and they kept our rooms close and they were a perfect location (close to reception) with a beautiful outlook. We had particularly fabulous service from Meneka by the pool, he couldn't do enough for the guests, including walking people to their rooms with umbrellas when it rained, he always made sure everyone was happy and comfortable and was lovely with the kids. The meals were all great, first hotel we have ever stayed in without orange juice at breakfast but plenty of other options. All meals were enjoyable and staff friendly and efficient, including those from the pool bar too. We used the hotels option of a  safari car to visit Yala and they kindly gave us breakfast picnics which was a lovely touch, I recommend doing this. We also got the kids the kids spa treatment of massages and facials which was great value and they thoroughly enjoyed, the spa is good value for a resort and treatments were a high standard and lovely and long. The reception staff (interns) were the only slight weakness, no one really seemed to know what was going on or understand English very well (admittedly a lot better than my Sri-Lankan), we struggled a few times with communication, including when our room wasn't cleaned and they took hours to finally send someone to clean it but a small fault in what was a great stay overall, would still stay again.",Family
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,3,All the fancy trims don't make for a great hotel,"I was expecting a lot, having read previous reviews, and I was disapointed, sorry to say.
This could be down to being dog tired when arriving and wanting nothing more than a quick check-in and hot steaming shower...I got neither.
Check-in was staffed by three people, but only one actually doing any work; and his job was made worse by having a bunch of demaning everything South Americians in front of us.  So check in took HALF AN HOUR!   Then we had to do a mini hike to our room, 500m away from reception.   But the kicker was the shower....a rainfall (no thanks) or a gentle spray !!!! warm but absloutely no pressure!
The dinning room is all fancy but watch out, you'll bang your head on the timber 'feature' in the middle as you try to squeeze by.
The buffet was fine, nothing special and I've had better elsewhere.  Same goes for the breakfast.
We totally missed out on the huge, probabily the largest i've seen at a hotel, which was a shame.  It looked wonderful.",Couples
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,2,Bad food experience for vegetarians.,Room is good. Property is good. But the food experience was very very bad. They mixed up the placards and item names of pappad with prawn crackers. When highlighted they were very casual about it. For strongly vegetarian people like ours this was unacceptable. We went to a hi end hotel jus because we are always skeptical about local hotels for vegetarian food for parents.,Family
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Great experience,"Are you looking for a memorable gateway that combines luxury, exceptional  hospitality and vibrant cultural celebrations I highly recommend visiting  Double Tree by Hilton Weerawilla. This  exquisite hotel not only provides stunning surroundings but also offers a remarkable experience that makes with the spirit of the season. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality of the staff was exceptional and extraordinary, with every corner of the hotel meticulously maintained to ensure cleanliness and comfort. It provides a welcoming atmosphere that makes us relax and enjoy during our stay. The luxurious rooms are designed to provide both comfort and elegance. Avrudu Festival held ensured that our rich cultural heritage is yet standing tall and strong. Endemic to our country and therefore uniqueness of it is unmatched in the world. Special thanks goes to Chairman Mr Saman Upasena and General Manager Mr Dayan , Front Office Manager Yomal and Head of Events Induka for their credible efforts in organizing various events, which helped keep guests happy and active.

Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Magical!!,"Words can't describe how amazing our stay was, absolutely magical! ❤️ The resort itself is a piece of art: The esthetics of the architecture, the astonishing views, the diverse fauna & flora, ... We have also attended the dining & high tea experience and had the spa treatment, which were all top class as well. Last but not least, we want to thank the entire staff for their friendly & exquisite service, attention to detail and their overall hospitality. They didn't just make us feel at home, they made us feel like family! ❤️ we have stayed in 2 different Villas. First one was the Premiumvilla and the second was a Sky Tented Villa. Both of them were just WOW! This has genuinely been the best experience of our lives, I hope we'll be able to come back one day 🙏🏼Thank you for everything.",Couples
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Honeymoon heaven at Aarunya,"We were so glad we decided to spend our honeymoon at Aarunya, it was truly wonderful. The sounds of the surroundings make for a magical and immersive experience in this beautiful location. We thoroughly enjoyed staying here, the accommodation and food is of an extremely high standard. The amenities are fantastic and feel very exclusive. The staff are all wonderful and were very attentive, they were always on hand offering any help we needed. We made good use of the spa treatments which were delightfully relaxing.
The sky habitat room was perfect for us, a little more storage space for clothing inside the room would make it even better.

One thing I wish I'd known was that the sun disappeared from the deck/pool area around lunchtime - makes for a beautiful sunrise though! Great food and cocktails too.",Couples
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Central Heaven of the Highlands,"This is one of the best boutique hotels I have ever stayed at, offering a unique glamping experience. The location and the sky-tented villa were amazing, providing breathtaking views of the Knuckles Mountain range that are indescribable. The amenities were new since they had just opened.

The staff deserves high praise for their tremendous effort, especially Mr. Nilantha, who was our personal butler. A special shout-out to him for his exceptional service.

Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Blissful escape,"We spent 3 nights here and it was blissful. Nothing had prepared us for the views which were absolutely spectacular and to add to the sense of luxury you could enjoy them from an outdoor tub on your balcony soaking in bath oil infused with local spices. Having an allocated private butcher made everything easy from ordering room service to booking a buggy and all our requests were quickly met with a smile.  The infinity pool has to have one of the best views in Sri Lanka. A magical experience which we will treasure. Many thanks to Halim, Gihan and all the team for making our stay memorable for all the right reasons!",Couples
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,2,"Beautiful resort, kind and friendly staff but nervewrecking noise all day","For this resort you need strong nerves or excellent noise cancelling headphones which you are prepared to use day and night. 

The resort is located beautifully in a marvellous landscape where you could listen to the sounds of nature only. 

However  , alas is is surrounded by temples where ceremonies can take place all day and are being broadcasted via loudspeaker with unbearable volume. ( including obituaries with people very sadly crying over loudspeaker ) 

The undoubtedly extremely friendly and kind staff cannot do anything to help. Perhaps it was just our misfortune- but three out of our four days there we were stuck in a very nerve wrecking situation having arrived in  need for peace and tranquility . Better check before you go there if any  ceremonies will be taking place during your stay",Family
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Very Memorable Stay at the Aarunya Nature Resort,"Had a very pleasant stay at the Aarunya Nature Resort with family over the end of year holidays.

This is a boutique hotel set in a very nice nature resort north of Kandy with a spectacular view.

A big thank you to the GM, Haleem, for making our stay very memorable. No, was never an answer. He made sure that all our needs and requests were met.  And ran a team that displayed an exceptional level of service in all areas from the room maintenance and cleanliness, down to the excellent F&B service and the tours and transportation.

Highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the Kandy area. The hotel lies between Kandy and the Sigiriya Rock region.",Family
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Different experience out in nature! Serene!,"The experience is so different to hotel living! Nestled in kandy, among luscious green trees, warm people and a personal butler - certainly an experience. While the loaded pictures are that of the tent - the tent is not a positive experience for everyone! We asked to move to the private villas at the top of the hill - where one could actually hear the azaan (call to prayer) 5 times a day from the valleys in front of you! The people at the resort: omg! This review matches my comments of that at the Hilton in yalla! Mr haleem, Mr Sanjeev and my personal favourite ❤️ personal butler Mr Nilantha Sisira Kumara - you are an outstanding human being- your attendance to us at breakfast - served on a table that felt like we’re at home, checking up on me when I didn’t make it for breakfast or lunch - and attendance to my laundry when I spilled hair serum on two white outfits! Mr Haleem - thank u for the complementary meal on day one! Mr Sanjeev, thank you for coming to check on the laundry to see how best to help me! Thank u to the warmest, kindest, most gentlest carying human beings that have cross my path in life! While Kandy is not a place I will necessarily visit again - I will probably come head to this very place to escape the hustle and bustle of life! Oh and the chef - you make the most awesome parathas! There were days I could have settled for just a paratha and a coke! Keep it up - you gorgeous human beings!

The view from our villa was breathtaking and I loved how peaceful everything was allowing you to enjoy the gentle jungle ambiance. The food and drinks were sensational! As this is a small intimate resort, everything is freshly made to order. It was some of the best food we had in Sri Lanka.

The welcome was ok , we were very confused what came with our package, and never really found out, having the all exclusive package I thought you would get all the beautiful food in the photos, no the set menu is so subpar I’m actually dreading what’s for dinner and might pay extra so I don’t get the what’s on offer. The staff don’t come and ask if you need anything, I wonder if it’s because we have unlimited beverages , I’m very disappointed, we have stayed in other resorts while on this trip that have existed our expectations this one has left us disappointed !!!!",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,An Amazing Experience At An Amazing Property,"After reading numerous reviews, we already had high expectations upon arriving at the Hilton Yala Resort, however, all of those high expectations were quickly exceeded!  And it was all due to the amazingly warm reception, friendliness, professionalism and overall customer service we received from the entire staff.

From the general manager on down, everyone made us feel welcomed and at home.  Vino, Dilasha, Bhasura and the guest services team were outstanding.  Head Ranger Sajith and Ranger Sam provided us amazing tours of the property and surrounding area.  Chef Shaakir and his crew prepared Instagram worthy meals everyday.  Sudesh, Roshan, Dilanka, Isuru and all of the staff helped to make our stay truly memorable.  I can’t say enough.  Thank you!

It was also humbling to see that the entire staff also went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son had an amazing time…which he did.

The property itself was amazing.  As many reviews mention, the rooms, the main pool area…simply stunning.  It was truly like staying in a dream.  The close proximity to Yala National Park also made going on safaris rather convenient.  

Bottom line, sitting out on the patio, enjoying the sunset with a cocktail in your hand as you watch the monkeys play in the trees…it doesn’t get much better than that!  

Overall, just an amazing experience and we look forward to coming back!",Family

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,One of the Best Stays of My Life – Hilton Yala Resort Sets a New Standard,"This was truly one of the best stays I’ve ever had. It was also my very first experience with Hilton, and thanks to Hilton Yala Resort, I’ll definitely be choosing Hilton for my future travels. From the moment we arrived, everything exceeded expectations.

The arrival experience was seamless, and every aspect of our stay—from breakfast, lunch, and dinner to the stunning pool and surroundings—was simply exceptional. The quality of food deserves special mention: it felt like dining at a Michelin-star restaurant. Every item on the menu was thoughtfully prepared and absolutely worth trying.

The service at the hotel is impeccable. Every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, helpful, and genuinely passionate about making our stay unforgettable.

A special thanks goes to our ranger, Rimesh. He’s a walking encyclopedia—deeply knowledgeable about Sri Lanka’s wildlife, birds, and nature. We joined him on three safaris, and each time was a unique and educational experience. The hotel is incredibly lucky to have him, and I highly recommend requesting him for your safari experience—he’s not just a guide, but a truly remarkable person.

I’d also like to acknowledge our safari jeep driver, Sithulpawwa. He’s the best safari driver I’ve encountered—thanks to his skills and instincts, we spotted every type of animal and were always among the first to reach key locations.

If I could give more than five stars, I absolutely would. Hilton Yala Resort delivers a level of hospitality that goes beyond expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here to experience authentic luxury and exceptional service.",Couples

The entire experience was smooth, relaxing, and memorable.

A special mention goes to Vishmi, who assisted us at the hotel restaurant during both our visits. Her warm and attentive service truly stood out—she made us feel welcome and taken care of every single time.

The food itself was absolutely amazing—delicious, beautifully presented, and with a great variety. The resort is stunning, well-maintained, and perfectly blends luxury with the peaceful Yala surroundings.

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Wonderful safari hotel in stunning location with fabulous staff!,"My husband & I recently spent a fabulous week at the Hilton Yala Resort & we were wowed by the entire experience. I don’t write hotel reviews easily but just felt that I had to with this resort. 

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff members offering cold towels & a cold drink & we were immediately made to feel welcome. This wasn’t a one off as the genuine smiles & greetings continued every day we stayed at the hotel. Whenever we returned back after our safaris we were welcomed by staff offering cold towels which were very welcome to cool down & wipe off the dust.

The General Manager, Gitanjali was very present in the hotel & made sure that she chatted to guests about their stay at her hotel. She had obviously carefully chosen & trained her staff to the highest standards & they clearly liked & respected her.

As the hotel is located in the Yala National Park, the safety of guests is treated very seriously by the staff. On arrival we had a safety briefing by one of the hotel rangers who emphasised that wild animals can & do wander through the resort. There is a track through the resort which is an ‘animal highway’ & there are raised walkways for the guests to use during daylight hours. Guests are not permitted to walk from their rooms to the main block & restaurant after dark but there are buggies that can be requested by calling reception. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a buggy whenever we called from our room. 

Now onto our room! We stayed in room 306 …….. where do I start? It was fabulous. The super king bed was really comfortable. We had a pillow menu but didn’t need to try any others as the ones on the bed were lovely. 
The room had a sitting area with a large TV that we only switched on once in the entire week. It had a dressing area leading to a huge bathroom with twin sinks, a stand alone bath tub & a large walk in shower. Now the toilet was definitely a talking point! It was a high tech Japanese lavatory with a sensor that opened the lid as you opened the cubicle door. It had a heated seat (not completely necessary when it’s 30 degrees!) it also had controls to wash your nether regions - front or back! It also had a drier too. 

There was a mini bar with some pay-for items along with complimentary items such as sodas that were replaced every day, along with bottles of water. We did have to call to ask for our sodas to be replaced a couple of times but this was a minor issue which was rectified quickly. If you like a cheeky drink in your room then I’d recommend you take any spirits with you as the mini bar bottles were very pricy. 

Outside there was a good sized private pool with a couple of sunloungers & a seating area. It was surrounded by trees & shrubs & we became obsessed with identifying the many birds from their songs using the Merlin bird ID app which I use a lot at home (highly recommend it but you will become addicted!) 

We also had visits from chipmunks & small lizards outside & hoped to see the residents monkeys but they didn’t make a visit to our pool area although we saw them a few times on the roof at the main hotel block. A couple of girls who were on the first safari with us didn’t heed the warnings to keep their patio door closed when they arrived & had an afternoon nap until they were woken by 10 monkeys exploring their room & knocking over their toiletries in the bathroom! A valuable lesson learned. 

The main pool area is large & well laid out but we didn’t actually use it. We had a safari every day either morning or afternoon ( a couple of days we did both) & just chilled around our own pool before or after we went out. 

The food was fabulous & the Executive Chef Jerome was very visible in the restaurant, chatting to guests & asking whether there was anything special they would like eat. He asked us to challenge him & his team with what we would love for dinner so they could prepare us a special meal on one of the evenings. My husband loves hot & spicy food while I’m the opposite. We were presented with an Indian banquet with starters & mains to suit our individual tastes. It was absolutely delicious.

Even when he was on his days off Jerome had briefed the deputy chef & he introduced himself to us to ask what we would like to have prepared for us on our last night. We were blown away by this level of service & once again had a fabulous banquet made especially for us. 

Now onto our main reason for visiting Yala - the safaris. I’m a keen photographer & love wildlife. We were lucky enough to visit Tanzania two years ago where we went on amazing safaris in three different National parks. We had a fantastic time & to be honest we were warned that we might feel disappointed with a Sri Lankan safari after an African one. This was not the case - they were just very different & special. 

My husband researched the best places to visit in Sri Lanka & found the Hilton Yala Resort which is one of a very few that are located inside Yala National Park itself. It employs its own highly trained rangers & offers different safaris to suit the guests. It is possible to book your own safaris from outside the hotel if you book the hotel on a different package but I would highly recommend using the hotel’s own safaris. There are many private safari companies but I seriously doubt if many of them have such highly trained rangers/trackers with the knowledge & expertise that we received. 

The hotel package we booked included one safari per night we stayed in the hotel. Our assigned ranger was called Saj (Sajith) & we were so lucky to have him & our driver Bodika for the duration of our stay. Saj’s knowledge & enthusiasm for the wildlife was second to none & we learned so much from him. He was able to answer all our questions & appeared to take genuine pleasure from our interest & enthusiasm for his country & its native wildlife. He was also a keen photographer himself so understood about the best positions to position the vehicle for camera angles & lighting & directed the driver where to stop. Our driver Bodika was fabulous! His driving skills were amazing & it was so much fun on the rougher tracks in the park - better than a roller coaster! 

Saj was able to find us the most amazing wildlife including leopards ( including two super-cute cubs!). To add to the experience he was also able to identify the adult leopards by name. The cubs won't be named until they reach adulthood & have territories of their own. We saw Elephants, Crocodiles, Golden Jackals & even a Sloth Bear, along with so many different types of birds - all identified by Saj. I was in heaven! I managed to take some wonderful photos which I’m still going through & enjoying the adventure all over again.

We had an outstanding holiday & would highly recommend the Hilton Yala Resort to anybody who loves the luxury of a fabulous hotel immersed in nature. We would love to return one day.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,An Unforgettable Stay: Scenic Vistas and Memorable Experiences,"The entire experience was exceptional. The picturesque views, delectable meals—especially the authentic Sri Lankan breakfast—and the delightful beach walk led by Mr. Chathura made our stay truly memorable.

The rooms were modern and comfortable. The staff were both friendly and supportive, ensuring a pleasant and relaxing stay.

Given the resort's jungle setting, it would be beneficial to have covers for the plunge pools in the rooms to prevent animals from accessing them at night.",Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,True luxury in the heart of the Yala National Park,"We stayed at the Hilton Yala resort for 11 days in May and had the most amazing time. The reviews and photos that you see on Trip Advisor paints a true picture of the resort and experience and it did not disappoint.
This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we wanted to stay somewhere close to the National Park so that we could do the odd safari or two, whilst also relaxing by the pool of the main resort. The location was ideal, with it being right in the National Park
and only a short drive away to the main entrance of block 1. 
Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted with a cold towel and welcome drink and then shown into the main entrance to the hotel, through a huge doorway that led into the reception, lounge and bar area. From here, there are floor to ceiling windows with a view over the resort, pool area and Indian ocean, giving a true wow factor.

Having pre-selected our room through the Hilton app 24 hours prior to arrival to be close to the elephant trail, we were then taken by buggy to our room. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded to a premium room with plunge pool.
Unfortunately, our pre-selection hadn’t been noted and we were allocated a room next to the main pool. We raised this with the hotel team and were initially told that the rooms are allocated 48 hours in advance and therefore they hadn’t received our request. This was swiftly resolved and we were then taken to the pre-selected room.
The room was very luxurious, with plenty of space, soft furnishings and mood lighting. The bed was very comfortable with a pillow menu at your disposal. The bathroom had twin sinks, rainfall shower, bathtub and a Toto toilet. The terrace had a table and chairs, two sun loungers, a sofa and the plunge pool. It overlooked the elephant trail, that runs through the hotel grounds and whilst there was evidence of wild animals having walked past, we didn’t see any during our stay.
The room was cleaned daily with a turn down service in the evening.

We spent most of our time by the main pool and as most guests are here for the National Park and safaris, it was mostly quiet and felt like our own private pool at times. There were plenty of sun loungers and the pool staff were always very friendly and greeted you with a warm welcome and smile.

The food offered in the hotel is up there with some of the best food we have had and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded from continental to full breakfast, along with 25% off food and spa treatments. For breakfast, you can order a variety of dishes a-la-carte and there is also a small buffet area with pastries and cereal. Each dish was beautifully presented and was delicious. Our personal favourites were the hummus on rye toast and French toast! All meals are served in the Dhira restaurant, which is next to the reception and bar area. There is another restaurant on the ground floor, near the main pool, however this was not used during our stay as most guests are seated in the Dhira restaurant. 
For evening meals, you have the option to choose from a variety of menus offering local and international dishes. All meals were delicious and again, well presented. We were also encouraged to order dishes off menu, as the head chef encouraged you to eat whatever you fancied!
We would have the occasional lunch sat by the pool area and the food was equally well presented.

The spa and gym are well appointed and we used both during our stay. The spa treatments were great and the staff very welcoming.

We went on two morning safaris and were able to see all that the National Park has to offer. We decided to book the safari directly with the hotel and whilst more expensive than other options available through Viator or other similar sites, it is worth paying the extra money. We had our own private vehicle and ranger and were given breakfast boxes whilst in the park. Having your own personal ranger allowed you to learn more about the park and resident animals. 

What really stood out for us during our stay, was the staff. Every single member of the Hilton Yala team were welcoming and friendly. Walking to the pool or restaurant in the morning, the room cleaners, gardeners, pool staff, buggy drivers would all stop, smile and say good morning as we walked past. It is therefore very difficult to name individual staff members. Having said that, Chanaka from the F&B team really set the tone for our stay. He was always kind and happy to serve our breakfast or dinner and would also encourage us to order as much as we wanted. 

Thank you Hilton Yala team for making our stay truly memorable and we will no doubt return in the near future.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,"Beautiful place to stay with a great location, clean rooms, and friendly staff","It was the most unique resort we’ve stayed in the whole of Sri Lanka. It was built in a way that we experienced luxury and nature at the same time. As it was our first time staying at a Hilton property, it lived up to its reputation. The staff were so friendly and welcoming, it truly made us feel like home. And we felt very safe the moment we walked in to the property as their rangers and other staffs guided us and gave the best tips and hacks to stay safe at the property as it is surrounded by wildlife.

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Luxury and Brilliant Service,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  The room was luxurious, the food was excellent, the attention from staff well judged.  The site is very beautiful with villas set amongst trees arranged around a large swimming pool.  We stayed only two nights and wished we had stayed a lot longer.  The resort organises tours of the Yala National Park and had we had more time we would have done some of these.  From the warm greeting we had as we stepped out of our car we were struck by the quality of the staff and their warmth.  We had several long chats with the General Manager, Ms Gitanjali Chakravarthy, who was interested in our comments and feedback on the hotel.  The executive chef also circulated among guest seeking feedback.  This sort of personal engagement with guests is very impressive and is, no doubt, a reason why this hotel is so good.  The junior staff are great too: our room attendant, Chamara, was very helpful.  This is a place to spend five days or more in to totally relax.",Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,This place feels like you're in Jurassic Park :-),"From Galle we went more south to explore Yala Park and it's safari's. I had high expectations for this one and oh boy what a stunning hotel. 

The hotel is fairly new and is in the middle of the safari park, not even surrounded by fences or gates, this to maintain it's natural habitat with the animals. Elephants pass by walking, and sometimes sneak into the kitchen, and there's even a pond where a crocodile was spotted.

The big door of the lobby looked like you entered Jurassic Park and it had grey stone elements and high ceilings, only the T rex was missing. Massive floor to ceiling windows overlook the resort and sea. We received a short briefing from a ranger ref security and safety and were told not to leave the rooms ourselves after 6pm.

We were upgraded to Premium king pool villa and i let the pics speak for itself. Massive bathroom with tub and shower, and space where every woman (and man) can dream off. Kids bed was also arranged and 1 sofabed was installed. 

Large terrace with sunloungers and the plungepool. We were located right on the corner of the path were elephants pass through. (However none spotted during our stay).

Around 40 rooms big this resort serves dinner and breakfast in the main resto, next to the lobby.  A la carte is served and we received HH discount.

The next day we did Yala safari's with a private driver, not done through the resort as i found prices were very high. 

After that we relaxed in the massive pool with sunbeds in the water, several jacuzzi sections and a kidspool. Don't be afraid when you see a snake swimming as they're not harmfull :-) the pool seemed endless.

The resort also organises morning walks to the beach (rocks) with its high dunes and massive waves. Not much more to do here.

This hotel was the hilight of our Sri Lanka trip and so well organised and neat. Staff were friendly and helpfull with the kids (buggy drive) and the food was of high quality. 

Hotels like these remind me why i stay loyal to to Hilton brand, as now and then you find a real gem.",Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,5 star review,Mind blowing property! This the whole experience I’m speechless. The property the staff the national park. The best experience of my life and Hilton yala national park plays the big role. With such beautiful property literally in the jungle and serving vegan food. What a friendly atmosphere. The staff was so polite. Honestly so far one of the best hiltons I have ever been to. 10/10 even the review doesn’t do the justice. Must visit. Love it.,Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,great experience,"Our stay at Hilton Yala was a memorable and an adventurous experience in the midst of the natural habitat of wildlife. What really grabbed was not only the human friendly approach of your cheerful staff but certainly also the echo friendly atmosphere which delivers and important message to our people saying all living beings should be protected and loved. It was a novel experience to anyone who visits this hideaway in the middle of jungle away from a boisterous city life. serene surroundings quietness ensures that you can hear clearly even the buzzing from an insect. Rooms are thoughtfully designed elegantly to ensure the guests are relaxed and felt secured. Food was sumptuous and mouth- watering and hence irresistible to go for the second serve. We are truly grateful to generous Chairman Mr Murga ,General Manager Mrs Geethanjalee and Chef Jerome for their credible efforts. We proudly recommend anyone who seeks a place to relax, enjoy delicacies and top class hospitality and stay here for a satiate stay in every aspect. 

Best wishes,

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Wonderful and Serendipitous Experiences!,"This was my third visit in six months, five nights on each occasion. 
There's an absolutely great reason why we will visit often. 
The resort is a stunningly architecturally designed, lovely place in lush surroundings in the Yala buffer zone, sensitive to protect its environs. The luxury is next level, love the amazing and superb premium villa with private plunge pool, hi tech and tastefully crafted and  luxuriously appointed interior, amenities and  unsurpassed comfort. 
The cuisine is extraordinary - Exec chef Jerome and team delight at every meal, the service is exceptional- Front office (Vino and team including the tireless buggy drivers), F&B (Indika and team), Housekeeping, Security (Chandima and team) and of course all graciously managed by the GM- Gitanjali. The spa and gym are world class as well.
But as a keen life long wildlife enthusiast, the primary reason for my unswerving loyalty  is the     superb best in class skill, utterly amazing knowledge and client focus of the Ranger Team,  built, led and nurtured by Sajith, the Head Ranger.
This visit yielded four separate and breathtaking leopard sightings deep in the jungle in addition to several large and smaller mammal sightings, stunning variety of bird life (including endangered species) sightings and the various  rich eco-systems.
I also went on a fishing excursion that is offered,  that was absolutely fabulous and enjoyable (Ranger accompanied), appreciating the National Park from a very different perspective from the warm Indian Ocean,  spotting wildlife on the beach at dawn and subsequent childlike jubilation reeling in Trevally, Barracuda and other species while fighting to bring in King Mackerel (locally prized Seer).  Another couple of great experiences that are also offered are the Ranger accompanied Dune Walks and Bush Walks. These experiences will keep your senses on edge in a delightful way. Totally immersed in nature, as intended.
In context, my wife and I grew up in Sri Lanka and know the land of our birth. We are Americans and I have been extremely fortunate to travel to almost seventy countries with work and on holidays. 
Hilton Yala Resort embodies many facets of the best that Sri Lanka offers including extraordinary and legendary Sri Lankan hospitality and genuine friendliness.",Solo
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,The Wow Factor Hilton Yala Resort,"What a gem this relatively new Hilton Resort in the Yala National Park is. We had the most relaxing 5 nights here surrounded by the wilderness of Yala National Park. The fresh architectural design of the resort is reflected in the high quality of the large room/suite we had (with its own pool). The large communal pool was a wonderful place to languish away the day after an early morning safari. 

All the hotel staff, from Gitanjali the General Manager, Jerome the head chef, our two beautiful waitresses,  the pool staff, the buggy drivers, the housekeeping staff and the two women in the spa who gave us super massages, could not have been more welcoming and friendly. They all took time to speak to us regularly in the kind and gentle nature of the Sri Lankan character. 

We felt honoured to be included in the hotel’s Sri Lankan New Year rituals and activities, mixing with hotel staff and some hotel guests. At times reverential and then some fun activities such as pin the eye of the elephant 🐘. 

Our Safari was very personal with just the two of us and our knowledgeable ranger.  We saw many fine examples of Sri Lankan wildlife, although we missed out on spotting a leopard, but that is in the nature of a safari and trying to spot an elusive wild cat such as this. 

We can highly recommend this beautiful resort. We loved it. Thank you to all you who made this such a memorable part of our holiday in Sri Lanka.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Go nowhere else but here when in Yala!,"Spectacular. Incredible surrounds. Hard to imagine you're IN the national park until elephants etc walk past your amazing zoom. The rooms are spacious and delightful. Incredible art work, clearly a lot of thought went into design and also supporting local artists. 
Yala safaris are fabulous. If you ride with Hilton rangers, you'll get a great download. Fingers crossed you see leopards (we did)  and of course the other majestic mammals. Love the elephants. And don't not appreciate the amazing bird life. 
The spa is amazing, and the pool is gorgeous!
Second last, OMG the restaurant. Chief Chef Jerome is a magician on top of what clearly is a man with incredible skill and talent. Hilton Yala could or should be a destination resort just to indulge in his amazing creations. 
And of course, lastly, Hilton Yala is like a super  6 star destination resort, it gives the likes of four seasons or st regis a run for their money, thanks to the wonderful staff. Professional is one thing but the genuine friendliness is next level stuff. So, full credit to Ms Gitanjali and all her team!!!",Couples

amazing dishes and if there is some item you want to try off the menu they will personally make it for you without hesitation.

Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,ABSOLUTLY FABULOUS,"A spur of the moment trip away from Colombo, for 4 nights. After researching many Hotels, we chose Uga Bay and we were absoluetly never disappointed. Every department, it was a first class service, with efficient warm and friendly teams. All of the staff, an asset to any hotel in the world. Living here for 20 years this is definately the most professional that we have stayed. The food was delicious and Chef Lakmal made us excellent dishes that we request (off the menu) nothing was too much trouble.
Without doubt we shall return to this beautiful sanctary.
Many thanks to you all for making it a memorable trip.",Couples
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,The closest place to paradise,"If there is one place I could choose to return to, Uga Bay would be it. Quite simply the most beautiful hotel you could wish to stay. Where do i start.....

Location - stunning and tranquil setting with unspoilt ocean views from every view. The journey to the east coast is well worth the effort, and forgotten as you step through the door.

Facilities - quietly understated, but exceptional quality and simply luxurious. Quiet and secluded rooms tastefully spread across manicured grounds adds to a feeling of total peace and relaxation. Attention to detail ensures everything you could need is provided (and those that you didn't think you needed!)

Food - mind-blowing - creative dining with an expansive ever-changing menu; prepared with care and attention by the most creative and friendly team of talented chefs; presented consistently beautifully; and with a quality and range of flavours that was a delight to enjoy at every meal.

But what makes this hotel truly special are the staff - every member of staff goes above and beyond to make each guest feel welcome. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by welcoming smiling staff, to the time we left and they gathered to wave us off like part of the family, each member of staff goes far beyond their roles. Special mention needs to go to Sajeev for his care and attention to us both throughout our stay. And also a big thank you to Santha, Usara, Yassa, Rasini and Sathiya, but while those are only the names we remember, I am grateful to every member of the Uga Bay team - you have created a unique environment that helps create memories that will last.

Will we return? Without hesitation. Sajeev and team, we will see you again soon!",Couples
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,"From the moment I arrived at Uga Bay, everything exceeded my expectations. The service was absolutely incredible every","The room was spotless, stylish, and extremely comfortable. The cleanliness throughout the hotel was top-notch, including the bathroom, which was modern and impeccably maintained. Room service was fast, friendly, and efficient.

Truly, every detail from the ambiance to the hospitality was pretty, pretty, really, really, incredibly good. I couldn’t be more impressed. This place sets a high standard, and I can’t wait to come back.

Highly recommended!",Family
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,Memorable Holiday at a Luxurious Beach Resort,"This was our fifth holiday at this beautiful resort and each time it keeps getting better and better. From the reservation team in Colombo, notably Mr Jacques Anandappa and Mr Jithendra Abeysinghe and the reception team at the hotel, Professionalism was the order of the day. All arrangements were seamless and smooth and we left after a three nights stay with further unforgettable memories. The Ocean Studio King room where we stayed was spacious and luxuriously furnished with all modern amenities and has a direct view of the ocean. To start the day with a stroll on the   pristine white sandy beach and watch the Sun rise simply takes your breath away. During your stroll you may have the good fortune of meeting the local fishermen, hauling in their overnight catch. Boat rides and water sports are on offer from private companies. The pool is very inviting with crystal clear water and blue as the sky. The pool bar serves up some mouth watering bites and delicious cocktails. The food that is served in the restaurant is unbelievably delightful. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and caters for all palates with English, continental and Asian cuisine as well as a Sri Lankan corner. Nothing is too much for the Staff. If you need something extra, all you have to do is just ask Ramani, the restaurant Hostess, who will do her utmost to produce it for you. The dinner buffet's are no different with live stations displaying the chefs culinary prowess. In a hotel where all staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful, it is difficult to single out individuals for praise. However, during this stay, there were a few staff who stood out for us, we  would like to mention by name. Chef Hismath who was very obliging and produced the most wonderful Dosa for me. Chef Thusal, Trainee chef Sanuji  and waiter Munas were the others who were very helpful and obliging. Hostess Ramani with her cheerful smile was always there to welcome us into the restaurant and attended to all our needs. Last, but by no means least, Mr Neranjan Morais the General Manager who was very helpful and always visible in the background. 
All in all. it was another wonderful holiday for my wife and I, and counting the days when we could go there again.",Couples
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,2,A sad experience,"I had a shocking experience at Uga bay as a considerable amount of money was stolen from my room during my stay.

It was a sad ending to our otherwise satisfactory stay in this beautiful location.",Couples
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,Everything excellent!,"We stayed at Uga Bay for 15 nights. It’s a fantastic hotel in a beautiful location for staying and relaxing. It's also a good starting point for excursions to places like Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Sigiriya, Minneriya National Park, or Trincomalee (for snorkeling), as we've already done. The hotel grounds and the beach are stunning, and the rooms are very nice and clean. All the meals are excellent. We absolutely loved the Sri Lankan corner with its delicious curries. But the best part is the staff. Everyone is extremely friendly and accommodating and they do a great job with passion. Thank you for everything! Best wishes to all of you, especially to Ismath and Darshan.",Family

So, now about positive points - the staff met us friendly with local traditions , we were checked in a nice room at the second floor. Aaaaaall staff are so  kindly, open-minded and service was excellent- in the restarant, on the beach - everywhere we were surrounded by care!

The room was very spacious even after having an extra bed and our big luggage. It has a wide sea facing verandah. Nice sea view from dinning area. Breakfast was good, but in-room dining lunch meals were not that tasty. There is a good souvenir shop in the hotel. One suggestion would be to have a couple of comfortable or relaxing sofas in the lobby / reception area to enjoy the view, especially during rain time cause the existing ones are hard and very uncomfortable.",Family
Mirissa,Mandara Resort,5,One of best stays in srilanka,"We had the time of our lives at Mandara Resort — an unforgettable experience shared with my husband and best friend.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the General Manager himself, setting the tone for a truly special stay. At the reception, Heshani greeted us with the brightest smile every day, making us feel right at home. As part of a beautiful welcome tradition, we lit an oil lamp — symbolizing the guests bringing more light into their home — a gesture that touched our hearts.

Day two was full of sunshine, laughter, and friendship. We spent the entire day at the beach with Lali, who went above and beyond to make sure we had the best time. From organizing beach volleyball and joining us in a lively karaoke session, to playing pool and arranging a cozy lunch, Lali made the day feel magical.

Speaking of lunch — we had the pleasure of meeting the head chef, who personally prepared a mouthwatering meal for us. The chicken curry, two types of dhal, vegetables, and rice were not only delicious but made with such warmth and hospitality.

Thank you, Mandara Resort, for creating such a memorable stay. We’ll cherish these moments forev",Couples

Mirissa,Mandara Resort,1,Poor welfare standards for the turtles,"The release of the turtles from the hotel beach area was highly flawed. Large numbers of baby turtles were left in buckets  for hours before release into the sea.

Mirissa,Mandara Resort,5,Spacious rooms!,"The rooms were huge and the bathrooms as well with a view to the pool and the ocean. We had only one night, but could absolutely stayed for a few days more. What we experience here and in other hotels in Sri Lanka was that the restaurants feel a bit more like a cantine than a restaurant, so the noise is bad in the restaurant with bad acoustic. They also had live music, so we were struggling a bit to talk with each other. The buffet was good, and some good choices of wine as well. One of the staff members had a protection area of eggs from tortoises and the babies are protected and when they are hatched they are followed safely to the sea. This happened when we were there, so it was a big happening for us.",Family

Galle,Fort Bazaar,5,Saved our Honeymoon!,"We moved to the Fort Bazaar after leaving a different hotel and wished we stayed here from the beginning! 

After having a fairly traumatic experience at a different hotel we arrived and were immediately put at ease by the staff. They were expecting us and even though we couldn't access our room right away we were given cold drinks and allowed to use the hotel amenities while we waited. 

Perfectly located inside Galle Fort the hotel is a welcome respite after a busy 3 week vacation. We stayed in one of the suites near the library upstairs and loved the ""push for champagne"" button. The room was light and spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous. The perfect luxury end to our honeymoon. 

We went on the walking tour offered by the hotel which was a fantastic way to start our morning. Our guide was knowledgeable and shared lots of their own personal history as well. 

We also took advantage of the social hour the hotel offers. The arrack attack was a particular fave of ours! Meeting other guests and making friends with other travellers. This is such a lovely touch and something we loved. 

The food at the hotel (both breakfast and suppers) was spectacular. A wide variety on offer and when I mentioned how much I loved the papaya, additional papaya was brought the next morning. 

Could not fault our experience - which I have to say was the same across other teardrop properties. We were sad to end the trip, but will most definitely be back. What a fantastic hotel!!",Couples

He is an absolute credit to Fort Bazaar and worthy of recognition for all that he did to make our stay incredible. Thank you Prasad! The pool at Fort Bazaar is tranquil and the staff around the pool were great too. We took breakfast every morning at the main hotel and the choices were brilliant.

From the moment you walk in passed the bar and restaurant and the cool lounge which are all open to the public you see the sign residence only and once through this doorway you find reception and a really awesome courtyard. Being a small hotel (18 rooms only) the service is personal the staff are fantastic and the rooms are clean and cool (bordering on cold) . The swimming pool is awesome the pool towels are lush and the food was some of the best I've had in sri lanka also the executive chef coming in the restaurant and chatting with customers was also nice. Definitely worth a visit just wished we had scheduled more time there.,Family
Galle,Fort Bazaar,5,Amazing!,"WOW!
Fort Bazaar exceeded all my expectations! It was simply wonderful. Everything about it was perfect. 
We are a family of four and stayed in the Upper family Suite, which was the most beautiful room. The whole hotel is beautiful in fact. We stayed three nights and easily could have stayed longer.

We really loved the pool area and could have spent all day there, if there hadn't been so much to do! 

A massive highlight was returning at 5 for the Happy Hour - the atmosphere was brilliant and the drinks (including huge kids mocktails) fantastic.

We stayed at 5 teardrop hotels (they are all fantastic) and did a Teardrop Journey - which I REALLY recommend.
Our journey included many activities. At Fort Bazaar we loved the guided 12k cycling train through paddy fields, a visit to a rock temple and a guided hike through the Kanneliya rainforest. I think the kids favourite activity was the traditional mask carving and mask painting at a real gallery with an artist in the Fort.

 We would never have found these activities if it wasn't for Teardrop suggesting/organising. These were all carefully curated for families in mind and our kids were incredibly sad to leave.

The food was fantastic, and despite all the options in Galle we ate dinner at Nine Skies 2 out of our 3 nights.  

In summary, this was a fantastic hotel to stay - we return tomorrow if we could. I didn't see any better option in Galle. Book it!",Family

All of the staff are so welcoming and can't do enough for you from checking in to service at the bar and around the pool. The newly built pool is a really welcome addition.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and have all the facilities you need.

The hotel only has 18 rooms so it never feels full or overcrowded.

With afternoon tea and happy hour with free drinks also included in the cost of the room it simply adds to quality feel of the place. Highly, highly recommended.",Couples

Galle,Fort Bazaar,5,Fabulous stay,"A charming colonial building set around a beautiful courtyard with lots of shady nooks-ideal for relaxing with a book away from the heat.

Room is very large and absolutely spotless with every amenity imaginable including a selection of teas and a daily top-upped minibar containing a variety of soft drinks, water and a beer.

Bathroom is massive with the fabulous shower, plenty of toiletries and soft towels.

The food here is the best we have had in our 2 week tour of Sri Lanka and the chef visits the guests daily for a chat.  Wonderful.

The staff here are really lovely, welcoming and friendly.

Such warm hospitality, especially the bar staff, who kept us supplied with arrack attacks, G'n'Ts and cassava fries at cocktail hour, and Sanjeewa, who looked after us superbly at the delightful, newly opened pool. Great food too, from egg hoppers at breakfast to crab curry at night. And our Family Room was a perfect base for the four of us. The team were accommodating when we were obliged to change our plans.

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,4,"Good Value for money, good location","Arrived earlier than check in and friendly, helpful reception staff arranged for us to get checked in early.
Apartment was spacious and clean . Tea, coffee, powdered milk and water replaced daily. Washing up liquid and cloth . Need to sometimes ask if want fresh towels but not a problem. Not really a lot of kitchen utensils, however supermarkets aren’t equipped to buy anything apart from snacks so not a problem. Swimming pool cleaned daily. Beds are a bit tired and the birds soil on them . Pool towels available at reception. Step out on to the beach from the apartment and several good beach restaurants. Maintenance was getting done to the rooms and pool and roof area while there. This will improve the apartments. Good value for money. Location good for restaurants, bars and walks. Friendly staff and the air conditioning is great as the heat is intense.",Couples

Thank-you Beach Apartments",Couples
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,3,Religiously cleaned!,"Great location on the beach with plenty of good options nearby.  The room was clean although bathroom floor was extremely slippery, could have just been the mopping detergent.

Excellent ambience with church services right next door, morning and night. Church bells ring every half hour from 5:30am until service at 7am (Saturday). I used to fall asleep in church when I was a kid, but try as I may, there was no sleeping through this service.

Some gym equipment is conveniently located in the sitting area/Cafe behind reception. Perfect for the couple who don't train together. 

Nevertheless, the washing machine was welcome at this end of the trip and no one got hurt.",Couples
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,5,Ocean Front - Spacious Apartments,"In the past, I have stayed at the beach apartments on many occasions. My latest visit was my first since COVID and the political problems recently experienced in Sri Lanka. Thankfully things are now much improved

The apartments are no longer operating as a full-service hotel, but none the worse for that. The ground floor restaurant is now equipped as a gym with a range of torture equipment. The former roof top restaurant is used as a casual seating area to sit and watch the sun go down

There are many places to eat locally. However, the apartments are well equipped with hob, microwave, grill, toaster, kettle, fridge, crockery, cutlery, pans and basic cleaning materials, making self-catering a good option. There are no large supermarkets nearby but getting a tuk tuk to stock up on groceries at one of the chain stores in the area (Keele’s or Arpico) is easy and cheap. Using Apps such as Pickme or Uber is a convenient and safe way to book a ride. You can also arrange delivery of “take away” food and groceries using the Apps.

Pescatarians should not miss a visit to the famous Negombo Fish market

The main feature of the apartments is the location. Front line with unobstructed views of the Indian Ocean. Some reviewers have mentioned that they have been disturbed by the noise from the Holy Rosary Church which is next door and this is true. Sri Lankans start the day early, and you will hear a short ring of one bell starting at 5:30 am and repeating at key times of the day. Also singing and praying, preaching and eulogising and the slow beat of drums on a day when there is a funeral. And yes, there are the cawing cries of rooks/crows to contend with. But you will also hear youngsters after school playing cricket or soccer and flying their kites and most of all, the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean on the beach below

The apartments are exceptionally spacious and layouts vary. Décor and furniture the same throughout. All have kitchen, lounge/diner, bedroom and shower room. There is also a furnished balcony. Some of the furniture and fittings are beginning to look a little faded and tired. But the staff work tirelessly to ensure that the place is kept clean and they will provide housekeeping on request. Any issues in the apartment are dealt with quickly. 

Rooms are kept cool with A/C and ceiling fans in the lounge and bedroom and a further ceiling fan and extractor fan in the kitchen
The apartments are equipped with Samsung flat screen TV’s. The choice of channels is not great but anyone who has a phone with Smart View or Mirror screen can watch their favourite streaming channel such as Netflix or YouTube. WiFi is provided for each apartment and is excellent

Although the reception is no longer staffed 24 hours the charming Manager (Nasmeer) can be contacted at any time. Daphne on who staffs reception during opening hours is very helpful. Security staff are there to deal with guests arriving or leaving outside of reception hours

An elevator/lift serves all floors. 

Outside, there is a good sized immaculately maintained swimming pool in a small secure garden fringed with palm trees and exotic plants. Direct access to the beach

Value for Money – Compared to tourist hotels in Negombo the rental price for the apartments is favourable especially taking in to account the spaciousness, the flexibility to self-cater and the front line Indian Ocean beach location.

X Factor – Located just a short distance away from the Negombo “strip” with its hub hub of restaurants, cafes, bars and souvenir shops the location is ideal. Anyone staying in Negombo for one or two nights may prefer to enjoy the facilities of a full service hotel. But for longer stays the flexibility to self-cater and to see and experience more of local life this venue is a great choice. In addition, the hard working staff are remarkable and go 100% and more to meet any requests guests may have. I cannot wait to return – and I don’t say that about many places!
During my stay in Sri Lanka I also made use of the services of Kulansa Tours who I have relied on in the past for airport transfers and island wide sightseeing on and off the usual tourist trail. An outstanding personalised service at a reasonable price",Solo
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,5,Great place to stay for a reasonable price,"Stayed at the beach apartments for two nights after arriving early morning. The security let us in and gave us the room key. They left toothbrush, toothpaste and water at our room.
It was clean, with a great view from the balcony in the forth floor.
The pool area was good, but the beach isn’t a place for swimming.

We found two good restaurants just outside of the hotel (Zen and Queens).

The staff was wonderfully nice and helpful!",Couples
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,5,"Excellent! For us, perfect!","We booked this apartment about a year before we travelled!!! Since then, we read a few worrying reviews, but we decided to stick with our instincts, we're VERY glad we did!
We booked for 7 nights, it was almost the end of a 56 night trip, 28 around Sri Lanka. Prior to coming to Negombo, we had a great stay in Colombo, the plan (and booking), was to have our final 2 nights back in Colombo. However, almost immediately we arrived in Negombo, we decided to stay! 
The Beach Apartments were 99% responsible for this decision!
Location - easy walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, bars, coffee shop, laundry and shops!
Directly on the beach! Beach bars less than 2 minutes walk away and a lovely pool & pool area!
Ocean View!
Everything we want in a location!
The apartment itself, some reviews said it was dirty, we cannot agree with this at all! OK, it's a little tired. The outdoor pool beds need changing, the cushions are dirty, but, you're given big, fluffy towels that cover the cushions! 
We stayed in 203. We had an amazing view of the ocean! AC in bedroom & lounge worked so well, it was almost too cool at times!! Good fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, comfy sofa, TV that mirrors your Netflix, etc. Big balcony with table and chairs. We would take this apartment around the world with us. The value is outstanding! Housekeeping is available, free of charge, daily, including 2 bottles of water and refills of tea & coffee etc. We would have loved a coffee machine!!  There is also a private rooftop, you are encouraged to enjoy it, the views are lovely!
The staff, both housekeeping and reception, were amazing,  couldn't do enough for us!
If I were to make a negative comment, it would be the crows! OMG! so many crows! 
Out of all the areas we stayed in in Sri Lanka, Negombo was our favourite. We will return, and we will stay at The Beach Apartments.
Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!",Couples

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,2,Alternate Reality,"We booked two weeks based on reviews and photos and should have checked more closely as none of those were recent. The photos are from 2017. Where do I start, well in my humble opinion accommodation needs to fulfil some basics, namely cleanliness, service, maintenance, value for money. So let's look at this.
Cleanliness is frankly appalling, our room was cleaned only after we insisted on day 5 and then only again when we asked but no towel change on either occasion. We are sure the room was full of mosquitos as we are covered in bites. The bedroom had ants and a visiting lizard. It all needed a thorough clean. The pool toilets are a disgrace and if management have looked at them in the last 5 years they have done nothing and certainly not cleaned them there isn't even a door!
The pool loungers are filthy and literally have not been cleaned for a considerable time either plus there is not enough for the number of guests and they are very uncomfortable with only one position and no recline close to the worst I've ever sat on. 1/10
Service
The restaurant is closed as is the bar and if you want to talk to anyone you have to be quick as reception is not manned for any length of time. The small amount of staff there are helpful though.Difficult to score service when they are not present 1/10
Maintenance
The whole site has clearly had no maintenance or attention for several years even basic things. The reception toilet door lock is broken the pool toilets doesn't even have a door the communal areas are dirty flaking paint and dirt everywhere all in all very disappointed on what would have been a lovely spec previously but sadly those days are gone. 
Then there is the noise and bedrooms, we were on the back of the propert in a suite and the church rang it's bells every morning at 5am loudly enough and long enough to wake us every morning, they also broadcast their service over loudspeakers. The black out blinds don't black out anything and the locals use the side alley as a play area letting off fireworks at all hours when I say we got no sleep it was so bad we left and booked into another hotel after 5 days and when we came back guess what they still hadn't cleaned it.
Summary 
No sleep, dirty rooms, biten to death, rubbish loungers.",Couples
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,1,Horrible experience in Srilanka Beach Arpartment - Negombo,"One of the worst places to stay. Poor customer service, horrible rooms and unprofessional behavior. They tell you adjust with the worst standards and collect 100% money in cash upfront. Pls don't do direct booking. The Manager tries to tell you do direct booking and not through any sites so they can cheat the customers. We will make sure that we take action against such poor standards of rooms and apartments that are provided after they collect USD 400.
When we complain, they say that wait till 2.00 PM and that too with no assurance that the quality of the room will be up to the mark.
Please do not do direct bookings. We plan to upload these pics on every platform so that these guys are not cheating customers after collecting cash and then saying no refund. So we checked out and have not yet got any money back.
Pics are enclosed here. More pics to soon follow.

PLS DO NOT CHECK IN HERE!!!!!! THEY ARE DUPING CLIENTS WITH INCORRECT PICS ON ALL SITES!",Family
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,3,Beach View,"Stayed in 2 bed apartment with wife and children. Room was pleasant enough but felt like it needed a good clean. Also it lacked basic kitchen equipment and the staff always seemed baffled when it was requested. Fridge also didn’t work properly. The reason people choose this kind of accommodation over a hotel is because they plan to self cater etc. Very nice pool area and nice views over the beach. Probably one of the best options in Negombo if the price is reasonable. However, biggest issue is the 5am kick off for the church next door with the tiniest speakers turned up to the maximum!",Family

Nasmeer and his team will go above and beyond for you! You will always be greeted with a welcoming smile and nothing and I mean nothing is to much trouble!
The location on the beach is amazing and after school the local children and adults will be your entertainment.. as the community gathers on the beach you will watch the children play soccer ( football), cricket and fly kites, there is music and laughter all while you sit either around the stunning pool or on your balcony watching the spectacular sun set!

Staff was courteous and helpful. Direct access to beach. Tuk-Tuk,taxis were available right outside so commute was easy. Overall very worthy of recommendation.

A few things however should be noted:

Location is right next to a church and the frequent prayers broadcasted over microphone can be uncomfortable.

Absolutely horrible Wi-Fi. If you’re planning on working, good luck 😊

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,5,Excellent Service and Stay,"I was back in my home bound from overseas for a short vacation. During that time i was spending my vacation with different destinations. Negombo was one of them. I’ve choosen the best hotel stay over there. It is THE BEACH ALL SUITES. At the first impression the staff were very courteous , active and helpful. 

The receptionist BERNEY did a very hard job while we arrive there. She was doing bellboy duty as well as the receptionist and Guests relation Officer.  Really appreciate her welcome and all the courtesy she had given to us. Though she looks very tired, she managed to give us the greatest service  she could give us at that time. Even her voice was soo much damaged cause she was taking care of too many guests that day. As we did a little chat with her we were able to get to know each other. 

We were checked in there late afternoon. the hotel was full and the staff also much tired. She was very friendly and within few minutes she gave us all the facilities and information of the hotel that we could facilitate during our stay. My wife was very impressed by her courtesy and her friendliness. Actually we were very tired of driving there from far, but once we went to the room it’s unbelievable. We’ve got the room as we expected. As we were three person the the housekeeping staff were manged to provide us an extra bed as well. Also once the housekeeping staff visited to the room my spouse has told him to check Air condition remote controller which had an issue, they’ve fixed it same time. They are very caring about the guests comfort. 

Unfortunately after checkout we had to face a car breakdown. But the hotel security staff immediately called one of the engineering person and sent him to take a wire for the battery charge. That time  the engineering person was doing one of his duties inside the lobby. Though he manged to bring a wire from outside and helped us, As quickly as possible. Meantime my wife was sitting at the lobby till the car got fixed, at that time also BERNEY have been very courteous to my spouse. We really enjoyed our stay with you. 

Highly recommended place for anyone who is looking for good surroundings , better service as well as helpful and courteous staff. 
Best of luck.

The menu offers a unique and thoughtful blend of local and international flavours that truly impressed us. It was exciting to see how each dish brought together ingredients in a creative way.

Some standout favourites included the starters featuring local mackerel, a flavourful soup, and a delicious kohila dip. The mains were equally impressive—the steak was cooked to perfection, and the cassava and coconut blend was a surprising highlight. It’s now our favourite alternative to mashed potatoes!

We were staying at two of this groups hotels so had them arrange all of the transport. I noted on other reviews there are comments on the costs. It is more expensive than doing it yourself but it makes it all the more convenient.

Quite simply, one of the most spectacular I've seen anywhere. There's also a beautiful large pool more suitable for families. The rooms are incredibly comfortable with solid air conditioning and oodles of amenities. There are several secluded lookouts that let you enjoy the views with more privacy. As an added bonus, the resort also has a fair share of wildlife, including birds, monkeys, and monitor lizards which you're likely to run across. Overall, a great choice for upscale lodging in the Welligama area.",Solo
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,An extraordinary experience.,"I’m not someone who often writes reviews. But my partner and I felt this place was truly an out of ordinary on several levels. I wanted to write this for others as I myself was unsure before booking it. But also as a reflection on an experience I won’t ever forget. 

We came to Sri Lanka because we wanted a luxurious break with some natural exploration and cultural exploration. My partner had been to India. I’ve spent time in Thailand and Indonesia for work and pleasure. I’ve stayed in seaside shacks I loved, airbnb and vrbo rooms and villas, boutique hotels and mandarin oriental /four seasons resorts in the past in my travels across the world. 

Arriving in Colombo - it’s worth paying for the expedited immigration- not at all necesssry but it was nice. We spent the night at a place near the airport as we arrived after midnight- cheap and cheerful and clean. We had arranged a driver for the whole trip (which is normal for Sri Lanka - they quote an all inclusive price including driver’s accomodation). A dedicated driver was the same price as airport hotel transfers and inter property transfers and gives you flexibility and a bit of a guide. Some drivers steer you towards places where they get commissions as is normal - so be aware. 

We took local roads to cape Weligama and with lunch it took us more than 6 hours - by highway it would have been half. And probably safer with less dodging tuk tuks, but also less colourful. 

The place is spectacular. I read before I booked to get a villa If you can afford it and I strongly agree. Again it isn’t critical but we loved the villas. And we had a premier one #37 which is closer to the center of things. It was beautifully designed - there is a good sense of privacy (although landscapers a s staff will sometimes walk around the shed but it didn’t feel bothersome). 

The bathroom is huge and gorgeous and luxurious. Pictures don’t do it justice. The steam shower was very nice. The towels and linens were commiserate with the environment. 

 Breakfast outside on our lanai/porch every day was magical. If you are in a villa it can be floating in your private pool or delivered. The fruit was particularly great. There were great squirrels around and one morning a mongoose as well as beautiful birds. It was idyllic. 

Overall the service was great and people seemed to geninuinely want to contribute to the experience and take pride in their environment. It has a relaxed atmosphere and not the Disneysque happiness at gunpoint feel. It is definitely not over programmed - while there are things to do and excursions - of you show up with a “here we are, entertain us” attitude, you may be disappointed. This is for people who want to connect with their environment and bathe in elegance and sophisticated design carved out of nature on the edge of the ocean. 

We particularly enjoyed the cooking class / some of the best food we had in Sri Lanka. It was great to see the extremely fresh ingredients and learn about the spices. We asked about a vegetable we had seen in a supermarket and presto it appeared - they take a lot of pride in their cuisine and ingredients. Aruna Kumara was the chef and he was ridiculously patient with us and we left feeling we could actually cook the dishes back home. Very highly recommend it. 

Also the spa was great - one of the best massages I’ve  had anywhere in the world was by Rina who was strong and anatomically focused/educated. It is usually one or the other if you are lucky. We went back a second time. The couples massage was also a great atmosphere and a centrepiece of our stay. 

Maga was the other massage therepist we encountered and she was lovely. She also runs yoga three days a week - perhaps my only constructive thought was that it would be nice to have yoga daily.one yoga session had the entertainment of monkeys cavorting in the trees. 

The restaurant is solid but it is also easy to eat out in the village - you could walk to local restaurants which looked good or quickly drive to beachside places where you pick your fish and they cook it. 

In addition to the pools shared by residences, there is a common moon pool with a breathtaking view and they will make you a coconut to drink :) pro tip - take it back and put it in your fridge. Cold they are on another level. 

Also you can walk down to the beach and swim in the Indian Ocean. There is also a bar there. The whole complex has pretty good wifi coverage. 

High tea was fine- not their strongest offering but it was fun to try the teas. Piuli (sp?) was a lovely and cheerful guide and introduced me to teas I would never have tried and now brought home.

We went on the local tea plantation tour. It was interesting. A little odd. Worth it to learn about tea and see cinamon being made. 

A note of recognition to Niswanathan (sp?) who I believe is the food and beverage manager and was accomodating and lovely when asked for help. 

Finally If it is in season - strongly recommend the maritime experience/whale watching cruise. It isn’t cheap - especially compared to local tours. But when we went out we understood why. It was fabulous. The crew is lovely. There was a very knowledgeable guide. The food was great. We were under sail a lot of the time. They are respectful toward the maritime life and a lot of local charters were awful - one of them almost rammed a Bryce’s whale rushing to get to it. 

Also - definitely recommend their sister property Wild Coast Tented lodge for two nights. But we love Cape Weligama so much we came back for an unexpected last night before we left Sri Lanka and it was the perfect ending to our trip.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Perfection.,"2 words. Moon pool. From our arrival and an upgrade from villa to luxury villa, every moment here was a dream! We were fortunate enough to be at a villa next to the moon pool with views of the sea. 
The Moon Pool is one of the most special places in the world. The photos do not really show the sheer size of the pool. With views over the surf it feels more like swimming in a warm clean lake. We even came swimming here in the rain! 
The breakfast was really something! (as with every breakfast in Sri Lanka). 
We chose a villa as we were on our honeymoon and the apartments / rooms overlooked the family pool. Being April however (on the shoulder season) the hotel was quiet and often we were the only people in the pool. 
The villa we stayed in was enormous. With a shared but private pool. We had no need as we were so close to the Moon Pool. 
The restaurant for dinner was great too - although def on the more expensive side. We tuk tuk into weligama and tried the increibdle RISE pizza one night and loved it. the hotel can arrange the Tuk Tuk so I wouldn't let the price of the restaurant hold you back its really easy to get out. 
We had fun with a few games of pool. The surf here at the new beach was a little rough for the swimming but if we had bothered the beaches on either side of the property looked pretty good for swimming. 
We can not wait to come back. A wonderful, honeymoon stay.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Beautiful hotel & the most wonderful team!,"We had a fantastic stay at Cape Weligama as part of a honeymoon trip to Sri Lanka! It was such a peaceful spot to spend time by the pool and beach after a busy few weeks of sightseeing, and felt like real luxury - particularly when every team member throughout the property was so wonderful and keen to make our stay extra special. They were especially careful with my severe gluten allergy, with the main chefs offering to make or adapt any dishes I wanted, which I really appreciated. Given this, we were a bit disappointed that we weren’t able to eat at Tableau restaurant as my husband doesn’t eat fish, and they couldn’t adapt one dish. However, it’s a beautiful hotel (our room was gorgeous!) with great facilities and we enjoyed our stay very much - we would definitely recommend it to others.

The food was great and the vibes were relaxing. We really enjoyed our day here. The kids also had a lot of fun at the Forrest school and jungle nook. Would definitely come again,Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Great hotel in a tropical garden,"We spent the last leg of our three weeks of honeymooning in the Maldives and Sri Lanka at Cape Weligama - it's such a wonderful, peaceful place! 

Rooms are enormous, even our junior suite (smallest alternative) was larger than any other hotel room we have ever stayed at. All thinkable amenities included, quite a generous minibar policy too, where everything in the minibar is free once.

Staff is friendly, attentive and professional. Food was extraordinarily good, with a huge variety of everything from local curries to cordon bleu - the chef's version of the latter was very delicious! 

But what really sets Cape Weligama apart from other options, is the property: it's like walking into an enormous tropical garden, with fruit trees, flowers, birds and butterflies everywhere. On the property we also saw komodo dragons, cameleons, bright blue kingfisher birds. The pretty moon pool overlooks the beautiful bays below the cape where the property lies, but our most terrific experience was just sitting outside the hotel in the afternoon, with some wine, seeing the sun go down, listening to the life in garden; suddenly two grey langurs (rather big monkeys) sat down on the roof above us, before they ran off into some other trees on the property. A peacock wandered by. Next thing, a wonderful moonlit dinner on the nearby terrace. Cape Weligama is very tranquil and relaxing, but also interesting and fun!

Rather pricy for Sri Lanka, we would still chose this hotel over any other, should we return to the island.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Luxurious pool holiday,"Rooms are well kept and large, beds are a bit hard for a Scandinavian, but linen is nice. Bathroom is clean and big, steam room shower is nice. Food is good lots of variety and customisation possible, cocktails are lovely.
Staff are well informed and take care of all requests.
I have a severe nut and sesame seed allergy and everything was catered for very well.
I must commend the excellent Amith who delivered breakfast to our room most days and took care of any in-room dining for us. 
A good stay.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,What a treat!,"My partner and I loved our stay, we certainly wished we could have stayed longer. It's tucked away on a cliff, as soon as you enter you feel a sense of calm wash over you. We had a traditional Balinese massage on arrival and my goodness did that set the tone, so relaxed. Might I add it was one of the best massages I've ever had. 
The villa's are so grand and beautiful, we loved our private pool and big bathtub. The layout of the property is great, we loved walking around to where we wanted to go - although the golf buggies are always available if you choose. 
The food and drink was exceptional too!! Excited to come back one day soon.",Couples

Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Like a heaven,"Fantastic hotel. Really Relais and Chateau experience. Service is excellent, staff so nice and always ready to help and make you feel like a hing. Food is so good. Definitely place to be. One important thing is that there is no nice beach. This is not a place to come if you are looking for a beach.",Friends
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Unparalleled.,"Let me start by saying I had mixed feelings about staying here as I was originally booked for the sister property Ahu Bay. An unfortunate glitch in the system meant there was no room for me at Ahu Bay and as a customers service recovery was offered a room at Cape Welligama. Despite being 1.5 hours away from my last location, this place is it. 

It has been such a long time where a five star hotel acutally met my expectations and exceeded them- all without being pretentious! The Sri Lankan service was impeccable. 

Rooms- chefs kiss! Spacious, everything you need plus things you wouldn’t think you need. Steam shower was amazing. 

Facilities- brand new and fabulous. Pools amazing, as was service as the beach. 

Food/ drink- yes expensive by Sri Lankan standards but well worth it. Cocktails were some of the best I had, with very generous pours. Dinner was delicious! 

If I am ever back in Sri Lanka, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here or any of their properties. 

10/10- no notes.",Solo
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Wonderful relaxing stay in a beautiful resort!,"Wonderful relaxing stay.  We had a large room with a lovely terrace.  The restaurant is very nice with sea views and a very good range of food and drink options, both Sri Lankan and International.  The gardens are very beautiful as is the coast and the peacocks.  The staff were all very friendly and the service is excellent.  People with mobility issues need to be careful to get a room which can be directly accessed by a buggy.  I think our room was quite a way from where a buggy could have picked us up had we needed it.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Best food out of four 5 star hotels  we visited,"The reason the food was so good was because of the selection and the variety of dishes that one could choose from the presentation was excellent. The spice level was amazing if you wanted it to be which we haven’t found in any other restaurants, the staff was so friendly and would accommodate any special needs you have from gluten-free to oat milk options.",Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,2,Over 30% uplift on restaurant covering tax and service charge,"Cape Weligama had some fantastic views and good pools. The staff were polite and gave excellent service.
The face price of items on the restaurant menu were just about acceptable for such a hotel. However the 31% added for tax and service charge seems unreasonable and we never found out how much of the 31% was imposed tax (which we had nowhere else) and service charge. 
Access to the beech and sea was not ideal",Couples

Laxman our butler was very helpful and appriciate the dedicated room service and complimentary treats. Neck and shoulder massage just as you checkin to the hotel is your hint to relax and unplug from your busy life. Holidays are to enjoy leisurely and there were no timelines for your meals which we enjoyed much. And we had the taste of srilankan and western cuisine on our stay which we think is excellant. I loved the seer fish curry and gamkukulmas curry which I think they have nailed it! We were surprised to see everyday Sri Lankan cuisine prepared with a twist! Simply, food was exquisite! We had the best night view and the best sunrise view feeling like its heaven on earth! Chirping birds, Pirith chanting from the cloudy knuckles mountain range and sun kissed greens just made the stay perfect! Thank you for the hospitality! Sri Lanka is proud❤️🌼🌸🌤️🇱🇰",Couples
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Nature and luxury go hand in hand at Aarunya Nature Resort,"Aarunya Nature Resort was a wonderful experience. 
Nestled in the forested hills north of Kandy you really do feel a part of nature, within 5 minutes of checking into our room we were watching birds, lizards and monkeys in the surrounding trees from our balcony. 
We stayed 5 nights in the Sky Tented room with its private infinity pool that had the most amazing view across the valley and forests.
The resort is lovely. It was smaller than I was expecting, but that gives it a personal and intermit feel. 
The staff couldn’t be more attentive and helpful. 
The dinning experiences were delightful and after informing the resort, when I booked, that both me and my husband had vegan dietary requirements the chef and staff met the challenge with enthusiasm and smiles and were able to serve us up delicious and interesting (veganised) local dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is very much appreciated as we know how this can be quite an effort.
The elephant excursion we booked through the resort was incredible, with an informative guide and great driver. It was also simple to book a car and driver at the resort to take us down to Kandy Royal Botanic Gardens, which was a surprisingly delightful way to spend a morning without having to travel too far. 
We were also taken on a nature walk through the resort’s garden where we were shown spices, fruit and the local abundant bird life. 
Our only regret was that we didn’t book more days there as we passed up a few of the other interesting excursions on offer so as we could spend some more relaxing time enjoying the resort and it’s tranquility.",Couples

Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Perfect Resort to Relax & Rejuvenate.,"Late review but a much needed & well deserved. The best resort we have ever stayed in, perfect resort to relax & actually unwind. We took all inclusive package & Sky tented room with private pool overlooking a spectacular green valley. anddddd it was sooo much worth it. Their super excellent service spoiled us from the moment you reach the resort. We were welcomed with a spectacular view & super warm staff. Also given a welcome 10 minute massage.  In the package, all meals were included which had 5 course meals every time. The chef was great & food was so delicious every time. Every day 30 minutes massage was also free in the package which was the cherry on the cake to relax completely. The property itself was beautiful & had short in the jungle kind of walkways to explore. It was a perfect getaway & the staff made it extra comfortable for us with their service. It’s a boutique resort so has like 9-10 rooms only mostly all with private pools I think. So the staff gives you full attention & comfort, be it getting you food in your room or at their restaurant. They have one restaurant at the lobby & fixed 4-5 course meal menu but still with 2-3 option in every course. They have Ala carte options too. Kids might not feel much to do in this resort apart from pool or some games. Thankyou to the whole staff for make it a perfect & super excellent stay 7/ for a thoughtful parting gift. We will definitely come back again.",Couples

We had a 2 hour spa treatment which was luxurious and spent the rest of our time in our beautiful villa, where we had dinner and breakfast. A true getaway from anyone for some quality time together.

Before we checked in we both were offered a 15 minutes head massage and they served Ambaralla drink as welcome drink. That was so refreshing and tasty. The staff were so friendly and the food was excellent. Do not forget to book a 1 hour Balinese massage if you go there. That lady is so professional. I must thank everyone butlers, chefs and the managers for making this a perfect stay. They will bring all 03 meals to your room as per your request.

Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,Could not find one fault...,"Aarunya was sheer indulgence. For location, décor, comfort, amenities, food, drinks and service – we gave 5/5 stars. The staff did not only meet our every need but were very willing to enjoy a friendly chat. Our butler Namal also took us on a tour of the property (and beyond) and explained in detail how the resort grew most of its own food and was mostly self-reliant. We enjoyed many lessons in biology, botany and ornithology !! Dressed in sarongs, the highlight of our stay was a traditional meal in a village setting, cooked in front of us, with live music supplied by a local duo. Thank you Aarunya staff !!",Couples
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,1,Burglary and Betrayal,"Our stay at Aarunya in Sri Lanka was a complete NIGHTMARE

Upon our arrival, we were allocated the wrong room, which already raised concerns about the hotel's organisation and attention to detail. Little did we know that this rooms CCTV was  conveniently 'broken'.

When we were out for dinner our room was broken into and our valuables stolen. The sliding doors to our room were smashed in, leaving us not only devastated but feeling violated and unsafe. 

On request, the police were called and statements were taken. What is perhaps even more shocking than the burglary itself is the complete lack of accountability and compassion from the hotel staff. Despite reporting the incident immediately and expressing our distress, we were offered no apology or refund from the management.

It is abundantly clear to us that Aarunya played a significant role in the burglary (hotel IPAD was left in room), whether through negligence or complicity. The fact that they have not taken any responsibility for their failures speaks volumes about their priorities and ethics.

Upon speaking with locals, it's become clear, there has been previous reports of burglary at Aarunya and allegations of misconduct. If we had known this, we obviously would not had stayed. 

In conclusion, I urge everyone to steer clear of Aaarunya in Sri Lanka. Not only does it fail to provide even the most basic security measures for its guests, but its callous disregard for our well-being is utterly disgusting.",Couples

 The hotel also arranged a walking tour with Mr.Tharanga who was a great tour guide. I highly recommend him as he has great knowledge of history and Galle's heritage.

Galle,Fort Bazaar,5,Best hotel in The Fort,"This place is seamless and standards are absolutely as expected from a property of this calibre. The rooms and common areas are immaculate and put together beautifully. Thoughtful details such as complimentary afternoon tea, happy hour in the bar and a la carte breakfast makes this place a cut above. 

The pool area is a tasteful, calm and immaculate oasis in the middle of the bustling fort. Staff are top notch, fluent English speakers and aware of the customer service needs of their clientele. The property itself is stunning and carefully restored with original features throughout in keeping with the heritage regulations of the fort. 

There is also a free guided tour/heritage walk of the fort with an expert archaeologist who has worked with planning permissions and renovating many of the buildings in recent years. It was a pleasure speaking with him and learning more about the unesco site. 

Sugath the head chef came to speak with me personally when I requested more local Sri Lankan cuisine and made me an exquisite bespoke lunch which was the absolute highlight of my trip. Avi and Lihini also went above and beyond to ensure we had our comforts met. Thank you all! 

We very much look forward to returning here on our next visit to Sri Lanka.",Family

We stayed in a Banyan Bedroom which was spacious and well equipped with a small balcony with seating. The newly opened pool is a great addition to the hotel and the perfect place to relax. All staff were friendly and helpful. Food at dinner and breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. Social hour at 5pm is great time to enjoy complimentary G&T’s, wine, beer,cocktails etc. We joined a 7am walking tour of Galle Fort with Tharanga, a heritage guide, which was both enjoyable and informative. Galle is a fabulous town with lots to see/do with numerous shops, restaurants and sights.

Galle,Fort Bazaar,5,Get into Galle!,"Arriving here following a stay at a dirty, tired and underwhelming hotel in Udawalawe, I felt my spirits lift. The staff were warm and welcoming and the old Dutch Colonial building is very beautiful. Light and airy, it has been decorated in very restful tones,  in a very  contemporary, comfortable style, with plenty of easy chairs and sofas to rest in. 

The hotel has 18 well appointed rooms, simply furnished but all furnishings are top notch and they have supplied everything you need.

As with anywhere, it is as much about the people who make the stay memorable and this is certainly the case here as the staff really do go over and above.

The pool area is only a year old, a clean and tranquil place with very comfortable beds and very attentive staff. I was very happy to spend time here reading and enjoying a book.

The food offered for breakfast was the best that we had had, unfortunately we didn't have an evening meal here but the complimentary afternoon tea with cake and biscuits and then the happy hour complimentary cocktails were a really generous bonus. 
There is a complimentary town tour offered by the hotel , which we would have taken up but had previously booked our own when we originally made the booking. 
Galle is a lovely town, particularly inside the Fort, with a facinating history and I would urge anyone staying to just take a littke time to learn about it. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend this place as a little Oasis of calm in a busy Sri Lankan town.
You won't  be disappointed!",Friends

Galle,Fort Bazaar,3,A good choice for Galle Fort,"An excellent location in Galle Fort. Most of the main shops, restaurants, and cafes - albeit geared for tourists - as opposed to being Sri Lankan, are so close by to this hotel. And the rest of the areas of interest in the Fort are all a slightly longer walk away - which is still not far, anyway. 
The layout of the hotel is well-designed. 18 rooms, all in 2 blocks. The rooms themselves are relatively spartan - with no carpets, and basic furnishings. The bed is comfortable. Essentially, the rooms are not really intended to stay-in for long periods except to sleep. My main frustration is the lack of space for storage of clothes - just a few hangars to hang clothes - so be prepared to live out of your suitcase. 
The pool area - albeit small - is quiet and a good escape
I recommend the Spa for a really good massage. Seems that there is only one staff, but she is excellent
The bar is lovely with good colonial feel. 
The restaurant has tables in and outside. The menu offers a range of international and a few Sri Lankan selections. This is the trend at Galle Fort. The patrons appear to be Western and market demand has resulted in relatively bland food to cater to tastes which are not accustomed to spicier Sri Lankan offerings. But Fort Bazaar’s Sri Lankan selection is probably better than the others, but still below the normal Sri Lankan flavours
The standout feature is that they have a few staff at Reception who play an excellent concierge role. One in particular is Lihini - she really makes that special effort to please
Ultimately, this is an average hotel which stands out due to their staff",Family

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the elegant décor and thoughtful design that perfectly blends modern style with the charm of a historic setting.
 
We were warmly welcomed by Nafhan, who greeted us at the front and gave us a personal tour of the property, sharing insights and stories along the way. His hospitality and attention to detail were truly exceptional, setting the tone for our stay.
 
The rooms are beautifully styled, offering a perfect balance of comfort and sophistication. Every element, from the furnishings to the lighting, felt carefully considered. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the hotel’s long-awaited swimming pool, a brilliant addition that elevates the experience at Fort Bazaar. It’s the ideal spot to unwind after a day of exploring Galle Fort.
 
The level of service was outstanding. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to ensure we felt valued and comfortable. Their attentiveness and warm manner made us feel right at home.
 
We were pleasantly surprised by the happy hour from 5 pm to 6 pm, where guests are treated to tea, coffee, cocktails, mocktails, and fresh juices. This thoughtful gesture added a memorable touch to our experience.
 
Dining at the hotel’s restaurant was another highlight. The space strikes a perfect balance between grandeur and relaxation, creating a stylish yet chilled ambiance. The food was exceptional, with an excellent mix of local and international flavours. Our kids were thrilled with the selection of Western-inspired dishes, while we indulged in more Sri Lankan-inspired options. The quality and presentation of every dish were impeccable.
 
Fort Bazaar perfectly embodies the spirit of historical Ceylon blended with contemporary island luxury, just as you’d expect from Teardrop Hotels. It was an unforgettable stay, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone visiting Galle Fort. This hidden gem offers both style and substance in one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic locations.",Family

Galle,Fort Bazaar,3,A sad room but nice staff,"The staff should really get a 5 star rating as they were very friendly and helpful. The 3 star is for the hotel itself. Mostly the room. A no frills room. No painting , no rug , bathrobes hard as cement. Floor in two different cements with foot prints. The shower wall had a huge crack. One could hear the neighbors next door flushing the toilet and the neighbors upstairs coughing.

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,4,Great hotel expensive drinks,"This hotel is absolutely stunning, the rooms are first class, the setting is amazing, the food was great. Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night so didn’t get to use the facilities. The only negative was that we arrived around 2 and they didn’t want is to check i while 3. We were rushing back out to do a safari so this was really inconvenient. 3pm is a late check in. Also lije a lot of the hotels they seem to be taking advantage with the drink prices, 5500 lkr for 4 beers then they add on another 2000 lkr in tax and service charge. The bar was completely empty! I wonder why?
Great hotel but stop ripping off tourists £10 to £20 pound for a cocktail is ridiculous Im a country where a teacher earns £200 to £300 a month.",Couples
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,1000000/10,"This was, without a doubt, the finest hotel stay we’ve ever experienced. Whether you’re seeking a tranquil, laid-back escape or a more lively and engaging holiday, this place offers the perfect balance of both. The views of the lake at sunrise and sunset are truly breathtaking—mesmerizing in every sense.

The rooms are of exceptional quality and come equipped with everything one could possibly need. There’s an abundance of leisurely activities available, and we thoroughly enjoyed each one. You'll never be bored- there's a pool table, karaoke rooms, rooftop bars, cycling etc. Extra fact, the pool water here is magical—unlike most pools that tend to dry out your hair, this one somehow made mine unbelievably soft?? I was genuinely stunned.

The staff were absolutely delightful—so warm, welcoming, and ever-ready to assist. A special shoutout to Imesh, whose vibrant energy made our dining experience all the more enjoyable. We were also lucky enough to partake in the Awurudu celebrations, which captured the spirit of the New Year perfectly. It was a joy to be part of it.

Without question, we’ll be returning. An unforgettable experience.

The Restaurant has an excellent and extensive buffet for breakfast and dinner, with live cooking stations and plenty of elegant seating and helpful staff.  There's a beautiful pool with fabulous views of the lake.",Couples
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Brilliant location and hotel and superlative service!,"We had the absolute pleasure of staying at the DoubleTree by Hilton in Weerawila for one night in late March.

Our traveling group will long remember our stay. The only downside is that we didn’t get an opportunity to experience the hotel and its surroundings in their entirety due to our time constraints. Next time, we will ensure a few nights' stay at this amazing hotel.

From the architectural design perspective of the hotel, including the beautiful rooms, to the warmth, attention to detail, and hospitality extended to our entire group by all of the staff, we had a fabulous experience. My expectations were far exceeded.

One of our touring group has an autoimmune disease that requires a special Gluten Free diet, which is hard to cater to whilst traveling across various regions.

However, we had contacted the hotel in advance about these requirements - which I think is the right approach, rather than just “turning up” and hoping for the best - and from the moment of our arrival right up until our departure, the duty of care shown by the management and catering department was faultless. Not to mention the wide array of dining options delivered to our table at dinner and breakfast. None of the food was an afterthought. And we know it's a lot of work for a busy kitchen to undertake. They could have taken some easy options when catering for a GF diet. But it was not the case here and the variety provided was fantastic.

I want to thank the manager Dayan, Allawatte the Chef. Chamindu, who ran a great restaurant and service, and Asanthi at the front desk for all their assistance. To the rest of the staff, from Turnstone (Lounge/Bar) to those managing the pool, thank you.

In our experience, everyone at DoubleTree is clearly doing something right. Keep up the great work. We look forward to visiting again.",Family
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,4,A Waste of Scenic Property,"The hotel is built on the banks of the Weerawila Lake, a very scenic area. But I cannot figure out why there isn't a single room with a view of the lake. All 78 rooms were advertised with garden view. That was a joke too. Please see the ""view"" from our balcony in the attached photo. The lake was visible only from the second floor (roof-top, no rooms) and from one side of the main restaurant.

Rooms on the first floor were better than the rooms on the ground floor faced a bit of garden with a wall at the edge.

The layout was another problem. Once you exit the room, you have to go round and round a long corridor (covered with creeping vines) to reach the reception area and the main restaurant. More direct access points either by elevator or stairs should have been planned. 

The rooms were comfortable, except for the view! Strangely there wasn't a single shirt-hanger. I guess we should have asked for them, but then isn't it Housekeeping's function to check all rooms prior to letting the guests in?

The Reservation made a mess of our booking. We asked for one room with twin beds, they had prepared both rooms with twin beds. The one who shared my room is a Hilton Honors member. When that was mentioned at the time of check-in they have made me too a Honors member.",Friends
Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,5,Quality hotel from the first to the last moments,"From the minute you walk in you know that this is a quality hotel. The reception area is lovely with many swinging settees and other quality furniture. Be aware, all luggage goes through airport security type x-rays upon entering the hotel.
The rooms are both spacious and extremely well appointed. All the fixtures and fitting are of quality. The bathroom offers two shower options, one at each end, a traditional rain/ordinary shower or a waterfall shower at the other end. The toiletries were the best we experienced in Sri Lanka.
The restaurant, buffet style was good for both dinner and breakfast offering a really large choice in both meals.
The pool, over the lawn from our room looked really good but we just did not have enough time to enjoy it.
Our room was quite a walk from the reception and restaurant as this is a big and spacious hotel, set in lovely gardens.

Weerawila,DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort,3,Disappointing,"Pros: Beautiful tranquil large hotel set next to a stunning lake with the largest pool we have seen in Sri Lanka so far. Welcome bedding and cake set out for our wedding anniversary. Staff friendly and helpful although information overload at check in with no further information in the room to double check what you had been told.
Room spacious, nicely designed, balcony of the lake view and pool non existent. Instead a huge tree and the sound of people enjoying the pool. Excellent buffet breakfast. Great location to visit Yala National Park. 

Cons: Our room had an ant and cobweb problem, initially in the bathroom. The ant situation worsened when the rains came. The balcony was covered in white crystal larvae that opened up overnight and turned into brown lumps of seeping mess. The balcony definately belonged to nature, more ants, cockroaches, baby toads.  

We were out on excursions during the day returning early afternoon when the rains came. The pool was the only entertainment for our 12 year old and this was shut in the afternoon/early evenings due to the adverse weather conditions. Sadly we never had the opportunity to swim in what was a stunning pool. With the outdoor bars and pool closed there was one bar option left (tunnel bar) with no atmosphere, music or other guests present. My daughter was somewhat bored as were we. There were no entertainment or provisions put in place for children or teenagers when the pool closed. Finally the distance of our room to reception and amenities was a good 10-12 minute walk, we felt isolated and perhaps had we been closer to the reception area we might have found more things to do to entertain ourselves. The complex is big so we didn’t befriend members of staff like in previous hotels.

This hotel is not for us, it lacked vibrancy, music, entertainment and the facilities to entertain yourself when everything else is closed. This hotel is a quiet retreat. I wouldn’t recommend bringing children in the rainy season.",Family

A few minor quibbles. Firstly, we were so far from town so had no other option but to eat in - and the cost of food and drinks really added up. Also - and I know this seems odd - the forks. I thought I was having a stroke as I struggled to hold the bloody fork!   I waited until everyone else at our table started to eat and they all had the same issue. Style over practicality!

Reasonably sized comfortable room; best night sleep we have had in Sri Lanka.

Due to the sheer number of insects and the need for lights to be off we had to use our phone torches to get into the room. This also meant we weren’t able to use the balcony and appreciate the beautiful location.

As the climate is tropical in this area, expect plenty of bugs and and small creatures about!   I choose the location to experience a safari in Yala, that however, was not as good as expected.

On the rooftop is an ala carte restaurant and bar wonderful for star gazing. There is of course a gym and spa, tea experience room, children's playground. Probably other things we did not discover. The rooms are spacious, all facing the lake. Very large bathroom with 2 full sized showers. The breakfast and half board meals served in a large airey room with modern sculpture.

We found the hotel pretty quiet during the day, which we liked, some evenings were busier with a bonfire on the beach and music but it was maybe 2 nights out of the 7 and didn’t disturb us. There’s a turtle egg sanctuary on-site and any overnight hatchlings are released by guests the following morning. The kids enjoyed this.

Mirissa,Mandara Resort,3,"Ok as a mid-range resort, but rooms need updating","I arrived a little early so was given an executive suite, which was enormous but obviously hadn't been used recently because it smelt a bit. The decor has not been updated since I guess the resort opened in the 1970s and looks like a film set for a retro movie in oranges and gold tones. The room was clean though. The resort had plenty of guests and has a nice pool and direct access to the beach. There are a lot of learn to surf schools on the beach if you are interested in that. The onsite restaurant was busy, and the food was ok.

Given that the resort is obviously doing well, am not sure why the decor in the rooms can't be modernised.",Solo
Mirissa,Mandara Resort,1,Big very big disappointment! Not going to book there any more.,"Disappointing Experience at Mandara Resort, Mirissa

We made a reservation for two nights with three sea view rooms, which are priced higher. However, upon checking in today, we were shocked to find that lagoon view rooms had been allocated at the same premium price, without any prior notice or communication. It was only after we inquired about the room category that this was revealed.

This lack of transparency and misleading room allocation feels like a clear case of dishonest conduct and unfair treatment of guests. Such behavior raises serious concerns about the resort’s ethics and customer service.

We advise others to be cautious when booking at Mandara Resort, Mirissa. Make sure to double-check your room category and insist on written confirmation to avoid disappointment.",Family

Mirissa,Mandara Resort,5,Part of Mercury UK tour,"I've given this place 5/5 because of the effort made to make our stay enjoyable, the location and the Turtle hatchery. Our room was ground floor, large and comfortable. Good shower. Tea and coffee, hairdryer, safe, some toiletries. We had our own mini pool at the back, which we didn't really use as surrounded by high walls and not very pretty. We did also have a terrace out front and could see the pool and the beach beyond. The food was similar to all the hotels we have stayed in, but there were a few more options if you wanted to avoid curry! The high score is because the hotel is right on the beach and on our last night, there was a disco, on the beach. We all danced and drank and sang. Then, there were fireworks on the beach and to cap it all, a Turtle came to lay eggs right in front of us. During the day, we saw an injured Turtle, attacked by dogs and the hotel had made sure it was treated. The hotel also takes the Turtle eggs from the beach, to stop the other animals digging them up. If the eggs hatch, they let the guests watch and help to release them safely into the sea. Fantastic effort to help these beautiful animals by the hotel. We sadly didn't see any hatched. Overall, our stay here was great. Walked along the beach at low tide, large bay, surfers and fisherman along the way. Some dogs on the beach and some pigs! Yes, we saw pigs cooling off in the sea. Really enjoyed our tour of Sri Lanka and this was a great finish. My only negative comment would be that the loud music on the beach went on far too late (still going at 11.30pm). Perhaps consider stopping at 11pm so guests can get some sleep!!",Couples
Mirissa,Mandara Resort,1,Not transparent and Unethical management,"Our travel agent booked a two night reservation for 3 rooms Seaview accomodation at premium price. We got telephone confirmation of our booking in the morning and when we arrived in the afternoon we were checked in. However at check in we were shocked to find our confirmed  premium Seaview rooms were sold to others.
Adding insult to injury we were allocated the cheaper Lagoon view rooms. 
These were not communicated at all time even up to the point of check in. We found out when the travel agent asked if we were allocated the Seaview rooms as we have booked.
A rather stout man that appears to be the manager nonchalantly offered us a compensation in form of “small form”. No apologies were offered.
This lack of transparency and honesty raises doubts on the integrity and ethics of hotel management. It gives us the impression this was a standard management practise of allocating cheaper room for premium price ones. 
It is disappointing that Mandara resort to to this. Please make sure you get confirmation of your type of room in writing and ensure when you check in you get the right room. Ensure you have time to change alternative accommodation.
Such practises should not be encouraged.",Family

Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,2,Not worth the stay,"I spent two night at Cape Weligama and sadly I didn’t enjoy my stay there.
I have to say the staff are lovely and very polite and helpful, but that’s the only real positive thing I can say.

The room I had booked had a damp and musky smell and felt incredibly dated. It was right next to the main road and there was loud music pumping so I asked to move rooms which they did. They moved me to a lovely room with a pool and while it was very nice, again there was just a strange smell in it.

While the resort is pretty, there doesn’t seem to be any ambience or atmosphere at all. 

They asked for my number on arrival so they can communicate by WhatsApp, they got my number wrong and when this was corrected, they still didn’t WhatsApp me. One night what I was waiting for a buggy, it didn’t show up and I was waiting for 15 minutes.

WiFi at the resort isn’t great outside of your room. It doesn’t work at the main pool.

The gym is good but again, just an odd smell there.

The service for all meals was incredibly slow, expect to wait at least 25-40 minutes and the food just isn’t worth the price. It’s very expensive and the quality isn’t worth what you get.

As I said, the staff are lovely, but when I come back to Sri Lanka I definitely won’t be staying here again.

They also quoted me $265 for a taxi to the airport when I was leaving and you can literally get one on uber for under $80.",Solo

Restaurant - the staff were flawless. The Executive Chef came out the first night to say hello and to discuss any requirements and subsequently arranged the most delicious Sri Lankan meal. Each meal was delicious and beautifully presented.

The Spa and Ali - I visited three times during my stay for various treatments including the 90 minute Ceylonese massage which was heaven. Ali was brilliant. The spa could do with a steam room and sauna to complete the overall experience.

The Front of House staff - for the warm welcome and personal farewell, assisting with our transfers and also day trip requirements. Plus a special gesture ( and much appreciated one) offering us a late check out to prepare for a late flight out of Colombo

Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,4,Honeymoon in Cape Weligama,"My husband and I have been on our honeymoon in Sri Lanka and we have stayed at some incredible locations along the way I.e Ceylon Tea trails (part of the Resplendent group) and Anantara Tangalle. Cape Weligama was our last big stop in the country. We were here for 3 nights and 4 days.

Coming from Ceylon tea trails and Anantara (more similar to Cape weligama) - we had the same level of expectations when it came to the level of service and room amenities.

Initially when we were shown our premier villa we were blown away by the view, outdoor living area, spaciousness, cake and Prosecco upon arrival - first impressions were overall very good. 

However we noticed some shortcomings to do with the room and general service (although staff are lovely and sweet) they weren’t as attentive compared to the other locations. 

We shared our honest feedback with the hotel and they have blown us away by how they have treated our concerns. 

On the second to last day Monty (GM) himself went out of his way along with his staff to ensure my husband and I would end up having a memorable and beautiful stay with Cape Weligama. They have really taken on board our feedback and have completely changed our minds about the place. They were able to move us to an even better room, offered us a complimentary evening dinner and met all our needs. 

Needless to say, after this will be back to stay at Cape Weligama.

Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Luxury on Sri Lanka’s south coast,"This was our first visit to Sri Lanka, which we were looking forward to as part of our winter tour including Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and a return to the cold UK through Oman and Quatar. Our 25 yrs son spoke highly of his experience during his backpacker/surfer visits to Sri Lanka, but we were looking for a higher level of comfort.
Cape Weligama is a member of the Relais and Chateaux hotel association. We have a friend amongst the management team at R&C whose advice I sought prior to our decision to book. I personally don’t enjoy Indian spices although my wife loves curry, hence the combination of western and local cooking at the resort was important. The resort scored perfectly well in that respect, overall, the food offering is very good.
We had booked a King bedded Master Suite and were allocated one in the eastern beach side of the property at ground floor level overlooking the “family” swimming pool in the “Arthur C Clarke” building of 4 suites.  The villa blocks are named after reputed writers, personalities, or navigators, coincidentally my wife’s maiden name is “Clarke”. We were a little disappointed with the view from our ground floor suite, the upper-level suites have more light, especially on the west side of the resort (closer to the adults-only halfmoon shape pool). During the first 24 hours there seemed an absence of senior management presence at the resort, but this significantly changed on our second day when having expressed our disappointment, the assistant Executive Director Mr da Silva met with us and expressed his objective was to ensure our full satisfaction. Since then we received an outstanding level of personal attention to our needs thought our stay.
Two days prior to departure, we received a complimentary upgrade to one of the higher elevation villas – this was very appreciated and offered spectacular sunset and ocean views with an abundance of wildlife proximity. Should we return, this would be the sector of the property that we would prefer.
The rooms are well constructed with good quality furnishings. Not quite the latest technology seen in more modern luxury hotels, but the internet connectivity was excellent, and everything works. The rooms resemble the earlier Aman properties we stayed in such as Amanpulo in Philippines.
There is direct access to a small beach where the hotel has a rustic bar with limited drinks. We sensed that this area could be improved with more extensive cocktails and smartened up.
As a guest you are assigned a “curator” or butler who’s role is as an individual concierge and point of contact with the hotel. Our curator “the Brilliant Brenden” was very attentive, and instantly responsive on WhatsApp, not only helping whist in the resort, but also being on hand and contactable during our off-property excursions.
Another star performer in their team was Mr Senith, the restaurant manager. Each day we would discuss our bespoke menu, and which place and time we would like to eat. These intimate dinners were a big plus to us offering variety and complete segregation when we wanted it, or mixed dining with other guests when we preferred. The Chef’s “Tableau” by example was a fun evening very well done, as was snapper fish cooked to our own recipe with roasted fennel and hollandaise sauce, as well as curry for my wife!
Activities included a marine biodiversity experience on a catamaran. This requires a 6am hotel departure. We do find nature and marine life interesting, and we encountered multiple dolphin pods, sadly we didn’t get to see a Blue Whale. The experience which included a swim and lunch at anchor near the port was not ideal, the sea was not particularly clean and visibility was impaired for snorkelling. Although we are boating enthusiasts, this would not be an adventure we would repeat.
Cape Weligama now has a dedicated naturalist, Mr Damitha who is very knowledgeable and added further engagement for us in the environment. Damitha is a recent addition to the team and should be encouraged to develop a broader range of nature activities. The property is home to numerous wild species. Complimenting the families of roaming Peacock we saw Indian palm chipmunk, monkeys, iguana, lots of beautiful birds and a quite rare civet.
The resort offers a range of spa treatments and massages that were professionally delivered. My afternoon Balinese massage performed by therapist Mega was a daily treat! However, the spa building does lack a relaxation area or any steam room/sauna plunge pool facilities which would be a welcome improvement.
Incidentally, prior to arriving in Sri Lanka I discovered that the production and sale of cigars is prohibited anywhere in Sri Lanka. This is a negative to be aware of; cigar smokers should travel with adequate stock for the duration of stay.  Thankfully, I stocked up at our previous destination and enjoyed my Habana cigar most evenings after intimate dinner with a welcome cognac or scotch whisky over a game of chess. Some political lobbying from the tourist department about cigars might be an initiative to create a useful concession in the rule.
This review is written from a global travel context using global not local comparisons. Overall Cape Weligama provided great personalised service and comfort throughout the eight days of our visit and is likely to be a destination of excellence by Sri Lankan standards. I would highly recommend it as a luxury destination for a global luxury traveller.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,4,Nice Stay at the Cape Weligama,"Had a pleasant stay at the Cape Weligama in early January.

Positives:

Beautiful location and Spectacular views.
Had Some of the best laid out rooms of our Srilanka tour
Had Some of the best food we had in our Srilanka tour.

Good access to the South region including the charming town of Galle.

We enjoyed our time here.

Negatives:

Service Level was not in line with expectations for an ultra lux resort.  Customization, be it tours or meals, was accommodated but after making it feel that you were being granted a ""favor"" , rather than a welcome and natural accommodation of the requests.

Staff communication was not as expected.    Hotel Senior Management was not at all visible, in contrast to all the other hotels we stayed at in our Sri Lanka tour.

The biggest negative is the value and quality of the ""experiences"" offered.  In my opinion massively overpriced in relation to what is provided

The beach is tiny. If you are looking for beach access it may be better to stay somewhere else (maybe the nearby Marriott).

All in all, this is a good hotel that could do a lot better by raising its service level and providing better value.",Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,4,4 Night stay,We really enjoyed our stay. The pools are wonderful. We had 2 lovely villas and shared a pool. The staff were very helpful. We have 3 kids in their 20's and they really enjoyed the beaches and the waves. It suited them perfectly. The only reason why we wouldn't return is because 2 of us are vegetarian and the options are very limited. Literally one or 2 options for the evening meal which was surprising and a bit disappointing considering everywhere else we visited offered many options. So we decided to eat out which didn't matter at all but it would have been nice to have had more options when we did eat in for the 2 nights.,Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,2,Astronomical price for average rooms and poor amenities,"We had high expectations since this was our third stop along the Resplendent Ceylon loop around Sri Lanka, after amazing stays at Ceylon Tea Trails and Wild Coast Tented Lodge.  However, this place didn't measure up to those properties for numerous reasons.  Unlike those hotels' incomparably elegant style and thoughtful amenities, this comes off as a generic luxury hotel with large but average-looking rooms (no art on the walls, no stylish touches).  Our room was at the edge of the sprawling property (room 52, avoid) and had a strange and unpleasant smell, which staff tried to cover by spraying with a room deodorising spray, with only fleeting success.  There were several problems with the plumbing, including a toilet that wouldn't flush properly and broken steam shower.  The night of our arrival we waited 15 minutes to be seated at the restaurant, even though they do not take bookings; we also waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  The family pool had no swim toys to offer besides a ripped, half-deflated football.  The moon pool (which we only discovered the last day of our stay) was wonderful, but children are not welcome there.  The location and views are amazing, and these flaws might be forgivable in a mid-priced hotel, but the astronomical price of our stay combined with the hotel's deficiencies in comparison to the other Resplendent Ceylon properties, plus the fact that Welligama itself has a ton of other more convenient options, makes this hotel feel like a bad bargain all around.",Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Great experience at this 5 star plus resort.,"Great 5 star plus experience at this unique resort. Beautiful landscaping, gorgeous rooms and bathroom, staff makes you feel at home, etc etc. And the best to come: restaurant is offering high dining, surprised us again and again at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Will sure return to this place one time.
One thing to be mentioned is, due to this landscaping, guests have to go up and down slopes and stairs so few rooms are easily accessable. Please request these if applicable.",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,3,Tropical beach holiday,"We booked a luxury villa for two nights. But unfortunately this villa didn’t have ocean view (at least partial). It’s not worth the premium price. We recommend you call ahead and specifically clarify the ocean view if that’s important to you!

Food : Breakfast was excellent. Dinner options for seafood were limited. I had local seafood platter which was great.

Rooms/ villas
Clean and well kept, but substantially below the standards for a high end resort. 

Out toilet was not flushing and hot water system was not working. This caused great inconvenience for us on the first day. When we complained maintanece staff came to fix it, but they could not. 
Then they offered us another villa, and said it would be ready by 2.30pm, and advised us to pack and be ready. But it wasn’t ready until 530pm. 

Staff- 
Good and friendly. But they looked tired and exhausted. 

Front-desk staff- 
Mahendra was great and helpful but Govinda needs bit more training in customer service. 

Location
Excellent and unique

Beach 
Have access to 2 public beaches, small walk, west beach was very rough, but the south beach was great, and about 300m walk from that point another excellent surf beach, all accessible.

Since it was our anniversary which I hadn’t mentioned before up until our arrival just as a casual chat to the staff, they had set up a cake in the evening and made us feel even more welcome! The room was absolutely beautiful and luxurious. 

The food was all ala carte i think due to season but either way it was basically world class.

Colombo,Hilton Colombo Residences,5,A Consistently Outstanding Experience at Hilton Colombo Residences,"Hilton Colombo Residences continues to be my preferred place to stay whenever I’m in Colombo, and for good reason. This was not my first visit, and every time I return, I’m reminded why I choose this property — the exceptional service and genuine hospitality that goes above and beyond expectations.

From the front desk and concierge to the room service and Flow restaurant staff, the level of professionalism, courtesy, and care is truly world-class. Every interaction I had during my stay was with someone who was not just doing a job, but clearly committed to creating a memorable experience for guests.

The staff at all levels are courteous, helpful, and pleasant — real ambassadors of Hilton’s service excellence. Their dedication to guest satisfaction is evident in every detail, and they truly uphold the highest standards that the Hilton brand is known for. Without a doubt, the people here are Hilton Colombo Residences’ greatest asset.

I would like to take a moment to personally acknowledge a few team members who stood out during this stay: Vinya, Jinanjali, Manodya, Tharaka, Travene, Dasantha, Denuvan, Chanthula — and especially Chef Rohan, whose warmth and culinary expertise added a special touch to my experience. There are certainly many more who contributed to making my stay exceptional — these are just the names I happened to catch.

To the entire team at Hilton Colombo Residences: thank you once again for a fantastic stay. I look forward to returning soon.",Family
Colombo,Hilton Colombo Residences,3,The guest experience needs improvement.,"We were provided with three bedrooms, but none of the air conditioning units were working. The rooms were extremely hot, making it difficult for us to sleep. We informed the staff about the issue at around 7 AM, and they checked the units and said it would take four hours to fix them. 

Since the rooms were so uncomfortable, we decided to leave and returned after 1 PM, only to find that the air conditioning still wasn't repaired. They asked for an additional two hours to fix it, without offering any apologies, and expected us to stay in the hot rooms. 

We had to repeatedly request to be moved to another room, as we couldn't bear to stay in those conditions any longer. We had already spent one night without air conditioning. Overall, the service was disappointing and not up to the standard we had experienced before. The only positive was that the main restaurant provided good service.",Family

Colombo,Hilton Colombo Residences,5,"Exceptional Service from Staff, But Security Needs Urgent Improvement.","I have been a regular guest at this property, and the customer service standards have always been exceptional. As a Diamond member, this remains my top choice for accommodation. During my recent stay, Sabarishna from housekeeping went above and beyond—his service was outstanding. Additionally, many other staff members have consistently delivered top-notch hospitality, making each stay truly enjoyable.

However, the security staff remains a major disappointment. Despite my previous complaints, their service standards are well below expectations. I have never encountered such arrogance at a Hilton property. Today, I once again had to report an incident to the front office after being obstructed on my way to my room while using the digital key. Their attitude and lack of professionalism are unacceptable and do not align with the otherwise excellent service provided by the rest of the team.

Overall, while the hospitality from most of the staff is impeccable, the experience is tarnished by the unprofessional behavior of the security personnel. I sincerely hope management takes immediate action to address this issue.",Family

The journey out

After a pleasant  enough trip over the ocean from the UK to CMB via Abu Dhabi, we were eager to hop into our Uber ride over to the Hilton Colombo.

Top tip

Get your currency at the ATMs or foreign exchanges booths immediately after passport control.

In order to keep in contact  or to simply navigate your way around Sri Lanka either purchase an Esim before you leave the UK or get a tourist Sim card from the Dialog mobile phone desk located in the arrivals area.

Transportation

Uber works well here and they are safe and reliable (the taxi pickup point is via the S2 doorway exit – it’s well signposted). If using a local taxi, try to get a metered one and/or agree the price first. The journey from the airport to central Colombo was around 45 mins.

Arrival & Check-in

On arrival at the Hilton, we were met by Lakshitha the smilingly bellman, who quickly whisked our bags away. It was a great first impression of things to during our extended stay.

The building from the outside is pretty impressive with well manicured lawns, but as you enter the central atrium, there is a wow factor due to the sheer amount of space, it’s airy and well decorated with a modern contemporary finish and was always spotlessly clean during our stay.

Big bright spaces tastefully designed with areas to sit and work or to relax in. We were impressed by the clever lighting and lovely tones of dark in the recessed ceiling. The fresh daily flower displays throughout the hotel were also a nice touch.

Check-in was smooth and welcoming with many staff members on hand to help. Naleesha and her team members explained where everything was and how everything worked. They were both professional and personable, offering a welcome drink to guests which I thought was a great touch.   

To our surprise, they also upgraded us to an executive room to use during our stay which was very welcomed and unexpected.  This was lovely and personal touch that made us feel genuinely valued as HH diamond members and excited about our stay.

The exec room blended modern luxury and classic elegance. The room had a lovely ambient and comforting decor. It felt light and spacious. The room also had a super quite noise free air conditioning system, ideal for getting a great night’s sleep. The bed was super comfortable with a choice of pillows and high-quality white linen – just what was needed after a long  journey.  The view from the room of the sunset over the Galle Face Beach was wonderful to watch each evening.

The hotel has just completed a major refurbishment where they renovated all rooms and it shows. There were lots of sockets with USB ports, as well as UK type 3 pin ones by the bed which were handy for multiple device charging.

A top tip for this hotel is to request to be on the seaview side (as these have the best views).

The hotels location works perfectly for us as its a great place from which to explore Colombo. It is also easy to access most other areas of the city including Galle Face Beach and the Lotus Tower. If you are a walker, you’ll be fine without taxis/ tuk-tuks for the most part. 

There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the surrounding areas as well as boutique shops and markets particularly at the nearby Galle Face Mall. It’s a very safe city to explore, locals are only to pleased to help and English is widely spoken.

Tip 

In addition to the high end shops located at Galle Mall, on the lower floor there is a variety of eateries and it’s also the nearest branch of Keells supermarket if you need to purchase any snacks or last minute toiletries.

Another one of the big pluses for staying at this hotel is its very close to Colombo Fort railway station for those who wish extend their stay by travelling inland to the likes of Kandy, Ella or beyond. 

Tip 

Book your train tickets online via Sri Lanka railways website and save the e-ticket to your phone, it’s more convenient that queuing in person at the railway booking office.  FYI book early particularly for the train to Ella as it can get really busy especially at the weekends. Also at most stations, its cash only payment.

Restaurants and dining 

The hotel has a number of restaurants and bars with a variety of cuisines and styles including ‘Graze’, ‘LAB’,  ‘SunsetBlu’ and ‘Emperor’s Wok’ to name a few.

 Breakfast is served in ‘Graze’ which has a very comfortable seating area and a very extensive and impressive buffet selection spanning Vegan, Asian, European, Indian and local dishes plus cooked to order foods, such as poached eggs and omelettes or whatever took your fancy.

The breakfast was excellent, it was always very tasty, plentiful with warm and attentive service to boot (particularly shout out to the restaurant manager Ms Sajee, young Oshadha and Fonia who greeted us daily with big beaming smiles). It made a great start to each day.

Everything we ate was delicious, so much so we often had to resist temptation to have a second breakfast each.

If you want to maximise  your lazy time whilst having breakfast, lunch or dinner, ask to be seated in the outdoor area at Graze overlooking the lotus themed lake watching the koi carp and black swans, its a great setting to munch on a croissant and have a cup of tea or spot of afternoon brunch.

The hotel has a reputation for its food, and it could be for that reason that it was noticeably busier at the weekends. From looking at the LAB menu they have a lot of great looking choices including afternoon tea and extensive range of drinks at reasonable prices too.

Service and facilities at the pool area were consistently solid as you’d expect at a 5 star hotel, with comfy sun loungers, water and towels, plus a range of delicious food and snacks available at the  pool-side. Service was attentive and responsive with that same welcoming smile that greeted us upon arrival (talking about you Roshan, Haren and Lucky, thanks guys). The hotel also has a modern gym space with a plenty of cardio machines, enough to have a good workout if that’s your thing. The hotel also has a spa but we did not visit may be on our next visit.

Executive Lounge

This is one area that this  exemplified the very, very best of the Hilton brand. Yes some Hiltons have lounges, but this one puts most to shame (talking especially to you Hilton UK). The ambiance of the lounge is particularly top notch with a warm welcoming vibe. The team consisting of Sachite, Manisha, Dinujain, Sithusadi and Kawmini are fantastic, customer focused and great brand ambassadors for the hotel.

The lounge is expertly overseen by Kirishnantha the manager who ensures that everything is always on point. He has a great manner about him such as greeting each guest by name and ensuring their lounge experience is an outstanding one. 

The lounge is situated on the 2nd floor with great views of the garden and the lotus themed lake. It had a large dining area together with a range of cozy and comfy informal seating areas.

The lounge is open for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. In the day time it’s mainly tea, soft drinks and yummy cookies and cake; as well as providing a great space in which to unwind and watch the world go by.

Its in the evening where the lounge shines brightly with its complimentary buffet and drinks offer 18.00 - 20.00 hrs. This included a variety of tasty cold and hot snacks including meat, fish and pasta dishes, sandwiches, sushi, soups, salads, cheese and biscuits, fruit and desserts. The food offer changes on a daily basis reflecting different international cuisines.

The food is fresh, very scrumptious and more than enough for a substantial evening meal.

The lounge also had a good range of wines, spirits and beers, as well as fruit juices, tea and coffee.

Another area we liked in the lounge was the television corner which made a relaxing place to sit that felt a bit like someone’s living room. 

 
In summary, why choose this Hilton, well it’s in a great central location, excellent and well appointed bed rooms and hotel facilities; great food, backed up by outstanding customer service from every single team member we met. It made a perfect relaxing holiday, so much so that we have already booked our next extended stay at this fabulous gem of a hotel.",Couples

We've enjoyed a few Saturday evenings there (reservation recommended!), and enjoy Omega's music while we dine and lounge. They've got a great array of juices, cocktails, mocktails and other beverages to choose from, and their food menu is usually on point in terms of taste.On our last visit, we were served by Ruhini, whose sweetness and warmth made our visit all the more enjoyable.

Colombo,Hilton Colombo,5,Outstanding service + personalized attention,"Fantastic property - made me feel like royalty as a Hilton Diamond member. Got an upgrade to a huge suite with fruit basket and chocolates. Had two amazing head massages at the spa. Shout-out to: Dinesh, Kiara, DinuJani, Hijaz, and all theFront Desk and Executive Lounge team members. Loved the Executive Lounge! Was able to get a late check-out, too, which was great. The entire hotel is spotless and high-end and staff are amazing and very responsive through phone and text. The only thing that's slightly strange is having to walk across the bridge to the pool and spa, but that's hard to change as it's a big infrastructure project. The Hilton even offered to organize a driver to pick us up, arriving late from Maldives, and I really appreciated that. Thanks for everything!",Couples

Colombo,Hilton Colombo,5,A big thank you to the team at Hilton Colombo,"We stayed at the Hilton Colombo recently and had a really great experience. The hotel’s been nicely refurbished and is in a brilliant central location – we were able to walk easily to Fort Railway Station to catch our train to Kandy, which was a bonus.

Facilities-wise, the gym and pool were both solid – the gym had a wide range of well-maintained equipment (especially the treadmills), and it’s supposed to be open 24/7. Slight hiccup there as we couldn’t get in before 6am on the morning we left, but otherwise no complaints.

What really stood out, though, was the staff. They were absolutely fantastic. My partner was taken ill during our stay, and the care we received was honestly above and beyond. There was an onsite nurse, and they quickly got in touch with a local doctor who came to the hotel and was brilliant. They even adjusted some of the menu options so my partner could have something more suitable while recovering. Just really thoughtful, kind people who clearly care about their guests.

We also spent some time in the Executive Lounge (thanks to Hilton Diamond status) and thought it was one of the best we’ve been to – great happy hour spread and a lovely team looking after everyone.

All in all, a huge thank you to everyone at the Hilton Colombo. You really made a difference to our trip, and we’re very grateful.",Couples

The staff was super friendly and really accommodating—from the reception to the restaurant, everyone made us feel so welcome. The food was absolutely delicious, and since my family and I are picky eaters, we really appreciated how flexible they were with our requests. The rooms and washrooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. We spent a lot of time in the games room playing chess, carrom, table tennis, and even tried out the pool table and other fun games. It was the relaxing, fun-filled vacation I truly needed—Uga Bay exceeded my expectations!",Family
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,Amazing vacation in the paradise.,"First of all just a general feedback: amazing, amazing, amazing!!! In details: We have been to Uga Bay for about two and half weeks and enjoyed everything from the beginning to the end of our vacation! It is really a first time in our experience that the personal is listening to any of the client needs fulfilling these and trying to go a kind of extra mile. The hotel area was really clean, the beach and the pool as well (Eg the rooms have been cleaned three times a day). Around hotel and on the beach there was a security who has taken care of the surrounding area ensuring a really good filling of safety forcing not thinking about the things like keeping mobile phone or like unattended. The food (incl. buffet) was really delicious and manifold. During the breakfast or dinner time the chef came to our table and asked for extra wishes of our children subsequently fulfilling these. The ocean water on the beach seemed to be clean. In general according to the several local opinions it is one of the most beautiful bays on Sri Lanka. Eg one day during our vacation the president of Sri Lanka was just swimming there. Dear Uga Bay thank you a lot for that incredible experience.",Family
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,The Most Magical Place!!,"Probably the best and most personally curated stay in Sri Lanka we've ever had. We spent two nights here and from being welcomed to leaving, we were looked after like family.

Dasun was our host and he made the stay seamless through simple explanations of how the property works. The dining and drinking experience was next level. Sameera looked after us throughout with Yasas supporting - both of the guys are so attentive that before we asked for anything, it was already done!

Anura looked after us at the main bar and Rakshini made sure she kept our favourite table always available.

Izmath - one of the head chefs came to our table multiple times and made sure the food was to 10-star standard. 

The people here, the staff, that’s what makes this place unique. It’s a location and service you cannot find anywhere else. 

CANNOT recommend this place enough. It is truly magical. If you ever visit Sri Lanka - DO NOT MISS!!",Couples

Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,quiet rest,"We stayed at this hotel from the end of March to the beginning of April for 10 days! Several days we spent on excursions. We really liked the service, the cleaning of the rooms, we went to the massage at the beginning of our stay, the beach is the cleanest on Passikuda, while we walking towards the elephant rocks we saw how dirty it was near other hotels. Our beach in Uga Bay was cleaned every day, the security was watching so that no one left entered our territory. All hotel workers are friendly, they will always wish you a good day or a pleasant dinner, special thanks to the man at the reception (I don’t remember the name) who helped us move to another room when one became available. As for food, we had breakfast included, at the egg station at the entrance the cook cooked a very tasty omelet and rice pita (my love), for dinner I would like more days like the ""Buffet"", when you choose a variety of dishes and this dessert bananas with chocolate will forever be in your heart.

Food was outstanding we ate in the restaurant every night, set menu gave lots of options and variety each night, the food was always tasty and high quality! The buffet was only available a couple of nights but both times plenty of choice, delicious and top quality food. We also ate in the beach restaurant most days which was great value for money and food and cocktails delicious! Beach was regularly cleaned so it was immaculate, white sands and clear blue water, ideal for swimming! Pool was spacious and clean and we made good use of this too! The staff are a credit to Uga, there was not one person from the gardeners through to reception staff who wasn’t pleasant and polite, always with a friendly welcome and smile, the service was absolutely outstanding.

Nimali welcomed us with a beaming smile which made us welcome and comfortable. 
Chef lakmal  and  his colleague chef prepared mouth watering  Sri-Lankan seafood  cuisine. They were very obliging preparing delicious food throughout our stay. 
We had a surprise birthday party on the beach, under the stars. It was truly spectacular.

Kalkudah,Uga Bay,4,A few improvements needed,"Very attentive staff,nice rooms,great part (best part) of the beach,Non of the other hotels had as good a section the beach , the beach attendants and beach bar staff where all very good. Good house keeping also by Balash.The grounds where we'll attended.
However, first impressions mean alot, the greeting area in the foyer /bar  is looking dated and a bit scruffy,could do with an update.Prices of food and drink are more than similar Hotels such as Sun Siam. We visited a few other hotels for dinning to give us some variation.We would recommend only b and b basis to encourage  you to try alternative hotels at night.Short walk along the beach or tuck tuck to Sun Siam 300lkr.Also everywhere else had some form of entertainment on (music),nothing  at Uga.
Non of the other hotels had as good a section of beach and the beach so would likely still choose Uga on that basis.
Only reason for 4 not 5 was condition of main foyer and bar and food prices for the quality of food and drink offered",Couples
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,Best Place To Be,"Our stay at Uga Bay was amazing. It was great to escape winter and enjoy the sun.

The staff were incredibly friendly. Dasun Guest Relations made sure that we were comfortable, he went out of the way to bring both Chefs outside to talk to us, when we wanted specific Sri Lankan food. Executive Indika, and Sous Chef Lakmal spoke to us every single day took the order from us and cooked all what we wanted for dinner.
Assistant F&B Manager Sajeevu would always talk to us to make sure we are enjoying our stay. Went out of the way to setup a table separately for us to enjoy a nice family dinner Privately.
Anoja the receptionist and the others at the reception were always smiling and checked on us to make sure we were comfortable with our stay.
Anura the Barman (great sense of humour) and his assistants served us special drinks and was always happy to talk to us every evening when we came out for a drink or for a tea. I do not remember everyone's name, but honestly the entire staff were so pleasant and friendly.
I have no words to describe how happy we were during our stay. I would choose this hotel again specially for the entire staff who is always smiling, and we can't wait to return for another unforgettable experience.",Family

I traveled with a baby, and the kitchen went out of their way to prepare something delicious for her every time! 

No one else used the main pool; it was just us the whole time, and the view from there was breathtaking! We stayed in the Cinnamon Villa, while our parents were in the other two, but the view from here was also incredibly! The floating breakfast is worth trying; it's an unique experience! The hotel has a Spa section where you can try Balinese massages or Ayurvedic treatments. I had a Balinese massage in the open-air spa surrounded by beautiful nature, and it was very cool! On our last evening, we tried the special Sri Lankan dinner - if you like fish and spicy food, this is a must-try! It was the perfect way to crown our stay!",Family
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,5,An Experience Like No Other,"I first heard of Aarunya Resort when a friend recommended it. He struggled to describe his experience. It was a curious combination of excitement and awe which didn’t make sense at the time but piqued my interest. 

I finally did book in for a night in February 2024. I was greeted on arrival at the car park and a buggy was sent over for my bags. At reception were 4 individuals who were ever willing to assist me with any queries I had. A glass of fresh Amberalla (a type of local mango) juice and a 5 min relaxing neck massage from the on-location wellness spa attendant set the tone.

I was curious to see the resort so Gayan; the chief ambassador and I hopped into a buggy. The next 30 mins was most amazing. Even though I now live in the UK; I was born and have lived & worked in Sri Lanka for 25 years but never appreciated the sheer natural beauty that this country has to offer.  Dusk was approaching; the mist and darkness made the distant mountainous terrain look like the backdrop of a movie set. I was privileged to have seen the landscape at that specific time and let the image permeate and imprint itself into my psyche.

The final stop was the spas. Aarunya Resort has an on-site western wellness spa and an Ayurvedic clinic too. I decided on an Ayurveda massage which had me encased in a paste made from indigenous leaves and herbs. The clinic therapist was very knowledgeable and explained the entire process at every step.

Massage complete and now to my room. Each villa is named after the trees/bushes which surround it. I stayed in ‘Pepper’ with ‘Clove’ and ‘Nutmeg’ being about 20 meters further down the path. The villa has it’s own dipping pool with a view of the mountains.  The room was extremely spacious, decorated in a colonial style with an enormous en-suite. A four poster bed, a divan, a seating area and an office desk (with connectivity) occupied the room’s ample space. The free mini bar, some resort-chef made chocolates, Wi-Fi and satellite TV enabled me the home comforts I required for the hour before dinner.

The menu clearly had the luxurious touch and each dish was lovingly crafted and presented. The enormous wine list was quite unique for Sri Lanka too. Truly a 5 star experience.

The next morning, I walked around the resort to marvel at the natural landscape. The resort is situated on 10 acres of land and has 8 private pool villas with incredible views. There is a meeting room, library and a fully equipped gym on-site. Walking though the tea bushes, I discovered an open air tea room which serves high-tea. The rustic yoga studio is next to the spas and was in full swing and so was the village hut where guests learn about local agriculture and partake in a traditional meal made within the hut.

The resort is surrounded by nature trails and is 30mins away from a golf course and also the city of Kandy. Many of the guests had returned from a day’s excursion and relaxation was the focus.

My realisation is that this resort is a labour of love - there is a certain meticulousness to the detail at every turn. From the light switches to the sloping of the roof lights, from the wording on the menu to the presentation on the plate; it’s just so perfectly aligned with the vision of it’s creator.

The breakfast choice was western or Sri Lankan. I chose Sri Lankan and was not disappointed. Six courses of wonderfully prepared local cuisine. Just enough to tickle the taste buds with whole lot of flavour. 

This resort needs to be experienced first-hand. No amount of description can do it justice. I was there barely 24 hours but this experience will live with me forever. Thank you Aarunya Resort, we shall meet again.",Solo
Kandy,Aarunya Nature Resort - Sri Lanka,4,Real blizz with some minor cons,"Stayed there as a couple in a tented sky villa for a few days and can say this hotel is a real blizz with just some minor things to consider before booking: 

Pros:
- Beautiful design and breathtaking view into the djungle (depending on the room type)
- Ideal for relaxing
- Staff is super friendly and always helpful
- Good (but bit pricy) food
- Butler service, in-room dining and minibar free of charge

Cons:
- Especially for Sri Lanka super expensive
- Air condition in tented sky villa is (by principle) not very helpful because the tent heats up super quickly. We tried to let it run almost all the time at the lowest temperature possible and it was still so warm that it was hard to sleep at night
- Condition of tented sky villa and its interior was a bit used and had at some places stains
- Location is a bit remote between Kandy and Dambulla - consider this if you plan to make trips to Kandy, Dambulla or Sigiriya",Couples

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,3,All Inclusive is NOT an All Inclusive rate with significant restrictions and availability,"We stayed two nights in a Premium Pool Villa on the Safari All Inclusive Rate which was advertised 'Safari All inclusive. Experience Yala with a daily safari and all-inclusive dining and free flow alcohol'. After checking in we were taken to our villa and advised that the free flow alcohol was only available during lunch and dinner service and did not include any items from the villa mini-bar which were all chargeable. We requested that this be checked as the room rate was extremely high (more than we payed at nearby Uga Chena Huts which was an incredible all inclusive stay). The staff member left our villa and called us about 10 minutes later reaffirming what she had told us earlier. 

We were in the foyer when General Manager Gitanjali approached us. We had a conversation regarding the advertised all inclusive rate and the restrictions we were now advised of (which were certainly not advertised anywhere), showing her the Yala Hilton website, and requested whether we could cancel our booking and return to Uga Chena Huts. Gitanjali was very understanding, checked the advertised rate on the website and listened to our concerns. She agreed that the website did not advise of any of the restrictions, and agreed that the alcohol menu from the all inclusive lunch and dinner service would be made available to us for the duration of our stay (by the main pool, pre and after dinner drinks etc).  Unfortunately this is an extremely limited menu that consists mainly of soft drinks, milkshakes and juices with a choice of one red or white wine and limited cocktail or spirits. 

On our last day we were informed that there were a number of mini-bar items available free of charge daily in our villa (beer and soft drink) that we were previously advised were all chargeable, this was disappointing. 

We experienced a number of ongoing service issues during the stay, where the all inclusive alcohol menu was refused, which required this issue to be unfortunately addressed a number of times each day. Fortunately it was resolved satisfactorily on each occasion with the assistance of Gitanjali or Front Office Manager Vino. We found both Gitanjali and Vino to be excellent; they were both friendly, intuitive and professional. 

The Hilton Yala Resort is one of the most luxurious and high quality resorts that we have stayed in anywhere in the world. The small number of suites and villas means that the large resort never fills too busy or overcrowded. The main pool is absolutely spectactular and one of the best resort pools you will come across. 

The food was of an exceptional quality and we had a number of great meals, with the chef happy to make variations for dietary requirements. The breakfast, lunch and dinner meals were all exceptional. The Hopper X Benny was the absolute standout breakfast meal! 

Service was exceptional and the staff at Hilton Yala Resort are well trained, we received amazing service from Hashini, Vishmi and Shamal during our meals. 

We did two safari drives with Sam the Ranger / Guide and they were great. The quality of vehicles and drivers used were excellent, Sam was very informative and passionate and made the experience very enjoyable. 

The Premium Pool Villa was exceptional! One of the best hotel suites that we have ever stayed in! Extremely spacious, well appointed and very modern with the latest technology and high class linen and fittings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen and towels of the highest quality. The pool was phenomenal and we spent loads of time in it. 

It it wasn't for the service issues and advertising issue regarding the all inclusive rate, this would have been easily a five star review and stay. Having to deal with this a number of times a day slightly ruined what would have otherwise been an incredible experience. The price Hilton charges for an all inclusive rate where alcohol is only served during lunch and dinner is not all inclusive and does not represent value when compared to nearby Uga Chena Huts or Wild Coast Tented Lodge which both have exceptional all inclusive offerings. 

I note after our stay, Hilton Yala Resort has corrected their website which now states 'Safari all inclusive. Experience Yala with a daily safari incl dining, free flow alcohol during meals.'",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Incredible stay at Yala Hilton,"Tastefully done hotel that respects the surrounding natural flora/fauna. 

Impeccable service and true glamping villas. Our check-out/departure from the property was so warm that it truly felt like we were leaving the house of a good old  friend. The hotel GM saw us off to our car and was genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one not just at her property but throughout Sri Lanka. 

The hotel staff handed us a package of water bottles for our onwards trip. What a memorable stay! The place surely has my heart.",Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Magical place from Jurassic Park 😂😍,"We came to the Yala Hilton on the recommendation of a friend of ours. Two couples 2 nights . We wish we stayed three nights. I read the reviews of some of the guest and could not disagree more . This is a magical place great value for the money. The Park was a bit of a disappointment after Wilpattu. But the staff at the Hilton from top management to the wait staff and pool attendants were welcoming . We brought some friends with us and they too thoroughly enjoyed their stay.
I would avoid block 1 if possible. 
Kudos to the Hilton team. We have stayed in many a hotel from both coasts of the US to Australia , New Zealand , other parts of Asia . I would say by far this place exceeded our expectations.
We are coming back with our kids and grand kids !",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Top Notch.,"Stunning setting. Beautiful room. Exceptional service. Everyone made us feel so welcome although we were unlucky with the weather; it had rained too much for the park to allow safari trucks in, we still thoroughly enjoyed our staff - wish it could have been longer.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,1,Terrible and Unpleasant,"I gave it a 1 (very poor) out of 5 stars rating because I did not enjoy my recent 2-night stay at Hilton Yala Resort from February 24 to February 26.  

1. Hilton Diamond member privilege
(a) I presented my Hilton credit card for incidental charges at check-in (Feb 24); however, the front desk staff informed me that the credit card deposit was not necessary., I was assured that I could settle the charges upon my departure check-out.  As a Hilton Diamond member, the front desk staff recognized my Diamond member status and acknowledged the 25% discount on Food & Beverage and Spa service.  
(b) On the 2nd day (Feb 25) when I returned to the resort in the evening after the safari tour, the front desk informed me that my credit card (credit card record from Hilton booking portal) declined the dinner transaction on Feb 24. The staff requested my credit card to settle the dinner payment.  Since I didn’t carry my credit card in the resort, I asked if I could pay the dinner bills altogether at check-out tomorrow (Feb 26), the staff insisted I must resolve the payment immediately.  After the dinner, the front desk staff took the credit card machine with him and accompanied me to my room.  At my room, the front desk staff showed me the total amount of 75,129.64 LKR to be billed which includes 2 dinner payment - tonight's dinner (Feb 25) and last night's dinner (Feb 24) payment; however, my credit card was declined, so I asked him to try it again, the 2nd attempt was successful.  Later, I received an email alert message from the credit card company that the amount of 75,129.64 USD was declined due to exceeding my credit limit.  In reality, there was nothing wrong with my credit card.  The front desk staff charged the incorrect currency which is why the payment couldn’t be processed. 
(c) At check-out on Feb 26, I reported to the front desk that the Diamond member 25% discount on Food & Beverage was not given to the Beverage items on both Feb 24 and Feb 25 dinner.  The front desk staff reviewed my bills and confirmed the errors, the correct amount should have been 49,275.00 LKR, and it was processed to my credit card right away.  The front desk staff told me that they will void the transaction of the incorrect amount of 75,129.64 LKR and will send me a receipt.  As of today March 7, I still have not received the void receipt.

2. Malfunction AC system
(a) The room temperature remained at 20 celsius degrees.  The temperature was unable to be adjusted, it could not be set to my desired temperature at 25 celsius degrees and as a result, I had to turn off the AC system during my 2-night stay. While I appreciate the General Manager's apology, I am disappointed that no compensation was offered for the significant inconvenience I experienced at a 5-stars Hilton resort. 
(b) I reported about the freezing cold room temperature on both the first and second days of my stay.  Despite confirmation that a technician had inspected the issue, the AC system was not repaired. The front desk offered an alternative room for sleeping only, which I declined due to the impracticality of packing and unpacking my belongings for a single night.

3. Bad Customer Service 
(a) Furthermore, I was insulted by the handling of my payment.  Being escorted to my room to settle the bill a day before departure due to a front desk error is unacceptable.  If the matter was urgent, I should have been informed at breakfast on the second day when the credit card rejection occurred.  This level of customer service is unacceptable for a 5-star establishment.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Excellent Resort in Yala,"Stayed at Hilton Yala for two nights with family, and it was a memorable experience. It is a modern and stylish resort, with an amazing Front Office, Restaurant, and Housekeeping staff that provide excellent services.

Situated very close to Yala Park, hired Hilton’s guide and safari jeeps to visit the park and saw a leopard, elephants (many), wild buffalos, deer, samba, crocs, and many birds. There was a leopard sighting near the hotel and an elephant visited the hotel at night as there are corridors within the property for animals. So, don’t go for walks!

Rooms are cozy and large, the bed is very comfortable, well-stocked bar, etc.. please note “no room service” due to the animals that roam within the property.

A special mention and thank you to Bhasura, Shashi, Kesha (Front office), Eranga and Seshan (Buggy team), Manohari at the restaurant, and Chef Jerome who made our stay memorable.",Family

Cons: very poor communication, many unanswered emails, not impressed by staff on reception and I include the lady who is the general manager .
They have 4 different menus but don’t tell you this , you will be given the ‘pan Asian concept’ menu ( the most expensive)in the evenings , which is not well executed. It was only when we sent the food back that we were told  other options were available .",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Amazing experience !,"Wow !! What an amazing resort. The best hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka. It worth the price.

The welcome was amazing from the moment we stepped in. Monkeys were playing on the roof of the hotel.

Lobby is very modern with a view on the resort.

Bedroom is like a villa. Huge, very clean, comfortable. We had our own pool which was a little bit colder than the main pool but still very nice. 
Bathroom was the best part of the room. One of the biggest I have ever had. Very modern. 

Housekeeping did an amazing job making up our room twice a day, that was great because of the dust from the safaris.
Towels and toileteries were replenished twice a day.
Bottled water was complimentary.

The main pool was very warm and lovely. I loved it.

The restaurant was very well decorated. You can eat inside and outside. Both were great.
Food was very tasty, but more expensive than anywhere else in Sri Lanka. 
Breakfast and diner were both amazing.

We had a safari from another compagny than Hilton. They picked us up in front of the lobby and the hotel was very closed to the National Park.
There is no barrier between the park and the hotel (we saw an elephant very close to the hotel). That explains the few restrictions inside the hotel (no room service).

It's the first Hilton of this kind.
And it totally worth it.",Friends

The highlight of our trip was my proposal to my partner. I would really like to thank the General Manager, Gitanjali who helped me plan a truly unforgettable surprise at “Lanthaaruma”, the picturesque outdoor dining experience on the beach.

We would also like to shoutout Malith & Janath from the kitchen, Chanaka and Hiran from F&B and the Head Ranger Sajith for their impeccable service during the outdoor dinner. 

The food at Hilton Yala, curated by Head Chef Jerome, was simply out of this world. Each dish was an absolute masterpiece, and we could not get enough!

Every morning, when I went to meet the sunrise, the gardeners, the guys who take care of the cleanliness of the territory and the beach from 5 am were already working like bees and at the same time the kitchen started working, which by 7 am prepared an excellent breakfast for us🙏By the way, when it comes to food, there is a huge selection of food, European cuisine and you can also try their local, which of course I spoiled myself with😊Everything is very fresh, waiters fly around you and constantly take care of you. By the way, even the chef sometimes approaches the guests and asks if everything is in order. The manager gathers the staff every evening before dinner and talks with them, apparently about the organization of everything, so everything works as it should watches. each of the service staff, from cleaners to managers, everyone greets you with a smile and asks how are you? what day have you had? they are interested in whether you are enjoying your vacation or everything is comfortable for you. I write a lot, because during my 10 days of vacation, I observed the details of the human attitude of the staff to the guests. they do not treat, because this is according to the rules, they have a soul and heart, they are really interested in you! They tell you and offer different opportunities, what you can see in their country or where it is better to go, what you need to pay attention to, and this is not for money, but just like that, without expecting anything in return! Everything is super in the hotel, I really liked it, I will be glad to return to them 🙏 the only thing you need to pay attention to if you choose this country is that you need to count on the fact that their alcohol is imported, that is why the price is high, plus they have a service percentage plus more something, so when you order something, it's better to clarify the final cost, so that you won't be surprised by the bills later😊But this didn't affect my wonderful vacation in this country in any way. Plus I got there on Valentine's Day, here of course the staff tried very hard to show the guests how they prepared for this day😊I'll definitely give photos and videos below.",Solo
Kalkudah,Uga Bay,5,The best hotel in Passikudah,"This hotel is well located right next to the beach . Unlike many hotels in that area it has a very wide beachfront area. It is set in a  well tended and manicured garden.
We had an ocean view room with a fabulous view across the beach and trees. The room was very spacious and comfortable and had everything you might need, including fridge ,safe, excellent A/C and a luxurious bathroom with plenty of hot water and a powerful shower.
The staff are very welcoming helpful and courteous.
The buffet breakfast was delicious and offered a whole range of Western and Sri Lankan dishes. 

If I were to offer any negative points it would be that the buffet dinner is quite expensive at 40$ per person. Also the beach bar plays music from 10.30am throughout the whole day. This can get pretty irritating when you're trying to relax and listen to the waves. Fortunately it is less intense if you go well off to one side of the beach. Maybe the hotel could offer quieter times on the beach?

All in all I do think this is a very good luxury stay and I would certainly return in the future.",Couples

Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Wonderful Stay,"For a relaxing holiday, it's best to head south to the vicinity of Weligama, a favorite spot for surfers. Here, Cape Weligama (Relais & Chateaux) stands out as the premier destination. This renowned hotel boasts 39 boutique villas and suites spread across 5 hectares of a former coconut grove on the dramatically picturesque Cape Weligama. The primary draw of this location is the stunning views, views, and more views.

The Ocean Terrace Restaurant, where guests gather for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is perched on a cliff, providing an unparalleled vantage point to take in some of the best scenery imaginable. 

Cape Weligama also offers three secret spots—secluded areas perfect for watching the sunset. Each spot is equipped with a table and chairs, and can be reserved for a romantic lunch or dinner. 

The villas themselves are spacious, each covering at least 130 square meters, and are built in the local architectural style. Each villa features its own private pool (shared between two or three villas) and a spacious terrace furnished with a table, sun loungers, and a sofa. It's an idyllic spot to sip tea while listening to the tunes of Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.

The cuisine at Cape Weligama is another highlight. Talented chefs deliver an impressive culinary experience starting with breakfast. However, the evening meals truly showcase their skills. A standout feature is the Chef's Table at the Tableau restaurant, where a seven-course dinner is prepared before your eyes. This culinary journey includes appetizers, soups, sorbets, main courses, and desserts, making for an unforgettable dining experience.

Chef Ishara Wijesinghe has honed his craft in various countries including Dubai over a 20-year career. He returned to his homeland to perfect his skills in Sri Lankan cuisine, infusing it with European gastronomic techniques. The result is exceptional—his cooking method could easily earn a Michelin star. Guests can ask about the secrets of local cuisine, get excellent recipes, and engage in conversations about global culinary traditions and life in general.

For those seeking adventure, Cape Weligama offers a variety of activities, from surfing lessons and whale watching excursions to guided tours of nearby tea plantations and historic sites. In conclusion, Cape Weligama is not just a place to stay; it's a destination that offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and immersive cultural experiences.",Friends

In few mints time again in the middle of me having my dinner, he pulled me out and wanted me to show him the coverage I did so far, and started lecturing me about my duty  by asking me to come to a corner. That director and his colleague didn't know any one who is at his property is guest and to be polite if he wants something done, instead they was so arrogant, annoying had guts to disturbed the gusts dinner in the middle of it too . Hence I decided to check out from Cape Weligama immediately and and which I did at 11/30 PM mid night. Horrible experience, and hence I will not recommend this property to any one or either I will step in to this ever again.",Business
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Not to be missed,"After having stayed twice both at Ceylon Tea Trails and Wild Coast Tented Lodge I finally wanted to experience the „Sea“-part of the Resplendent Ceylon Hotels. I am always skeptical about Conde Nast Traveller Hot-List Hotels but Cape Weligama really is a true gem! The service was so great and I loved the tranquility and general atmosphere of this place. The Hotel is immersed in its surroundings not separated from it, giving exit to the surrounding beaches. Everything was beautifully maintained and clean. I was upgraded to a villa, which I loved. Sajith showed me the property and did an amazing job. Since I unfortunately only had one night he saved me a lot of time by explaining and showing everything to me directly after arrival. He also made sure that I knew how to contact him, if I had any questions or problems. 
The food was also delicious. I will definitely return and can highly recommend staying here. Thank you very much!",Solo
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,HONEYMOON HEAVEN,"Easily the best hotel my husband and I have ever stayed at! Everything was absolutely amazing. The food was so delicious and the views were supreme. The highlight of our stay was your incredible staff! They were genuinely interested in our comfort and always went above and beyond to make our stay the best ever. Lahiru, Mahendra - our curator and Pradeep were so warm and friendly and we truly appreciate their efforts. Manula from F&B was the absolute star during our stay - he honestly went above and beyond and was the most pleasant person to deal with! Manula assisted us both during breakfast and dinner and at the end of our stay we felt like he was part of our family! My husband accidentally cut his toe on a stone and Manula rushed to get ice and a band aid and was so lovely during the situation. 

As a Front Office Manager myself in Melbourne, I truly appreciate and value outstanding service in the hospitality industry and am so proud to call myself Sri Lankan when I experience stays such as these. Your staff truly seemed like they loved their job as it shows by the way they work!

I can easily say that my husband and I will be dreaming of our honeymoon at Cape Weligama for months and years to come. 

Thank you to the wonderful team at CW - we will be back!",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Seven stars!,"This is the most incredible place we’ve ever been! From the incredible hospitality, to the cliffside views looking at the surfers below, to the delicious Sri Lankan and Western breakfasts and dinners, and to the beautiful rooms, this place deserves all of the accolades. This was our last stop of our (a couple) Sri Lanka trip and it was the perfect ending. Shaun was absolutely wonderful, greeted us at check in and hosted us the entire trip, ensuring our stay was top notch! He was a gem. The sincere nature of all of the staff also did not go unnoticed. All of the butlers, to bartenders, to maintenance around the property to the managers, were genuine and sincere to see you. Another highlight was tasting the different fruit or flavor infused arracks at the Surf Bar onsite. The drinks the bartenders made with those arracks were unreal! 

We stayed in the master suite, and the room was huge with a large private deck with seating. The all wood walk in closet was a nice touch to tuck away our suitcases out of the way, and the rainfall shower was the best treat after a swim at the beach nearby. The shower room also turns into a steam room, although we didn’t try it. And the half moon infinity pool! Highly recommend a swim there at dusk, as it’s pretty incredible to watch the sun go down and surfers below. 

All in all, our hands down favorite part of our trip was Cape Weligama! There’s not enough words to say how special this stay was. We will be returning in the future!",Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Amazing,"We didn’t stay at cape weligama but visited one evening to enjoy drinks by the bar and dinner afterwards. The setting and location were beautiful, overlooking the sea from the cliff top, the drinks and food of a high quality (food portions are on the small side for Sri Lanka) but what stood out most was the service which was the best we’ve experienced even in the few hours we were there - genuine, efficient and elegant. Truly world class. Beautiful property and extremely well maintained and well run. Well done team",Family
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,Stunning location lovely hotel with the best possible people.,A beautiful hotel in a stunning location but the star feature was the wonderful people working there. They made the stay and I could not fault their warmth friendliness and professionalism they were outstanding. Our first floor villa with huge suspended pool was beautifully appointed though the pool and outside area needs a bit of updating this did not detract from our enjoyment the view from the room was truly stunning. The main pool on a cliff top is one of the best hotel pools and views you will find anywhere.No hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel there is so much to explore and see so have good walk around.,Couples
Weligama,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,5,"Fantastic holiday, thanks to all","This was our 2nd time on the South coast of Sri Lanka, previously there in 2013, and it is just as beautiful as it was but much busier with more tuk tuks, scooters, surfers, everything really!
The Cape Weligama hotel is at the luxury end of the market price wise but mostly lives up to expectations. The villa was beautiful and we shared the private pool with only one other villa (tbh we had it to ourselves most of the time) and housekeeping by Sadasheena and Vimukthi was fantastic. We were there for 13 nights, started on half board for one week then cancelled that for the 2nd to give us a bit more freedom of choice as the evening menu did not appear to change.
We got out and about using a brilliant local tuk tuk driver, Viraj +94 773969530, who was a very safe, honest and reliable driver and I highly recommend using him. He lives with his family a few hundred yards from the hotel and would appreciate the work.
Inoka looked after us on arrival and Madushan was invaluable in making our departure so easy and stress free.
All in all we had a fantastic relaxing holiday with temperatures always around 31/31 degrees so landing back in London at 5 degrees was a shock, remember to take a jumper, we didn’t!",Couples

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,3,6 night stay at end of 14 day trip to Sri lanka,"We stayed here for the last 6 nights of our trip. I agree with all the other reviewers about the staff and the food the cleanliness of the entire hotel etc but what ruined our stay was the fact that we were right next door to the church, we were in room 402. Every morning without fail the bell was rung at 05.30am there is no sound proofing so its very loud. The worst part of this was the church services on a Saturday and Sunday which start at 05.30 and are relayed through a tannoy system. This goes on for several hours which means there is no chance of a lay in. This is the only reason we would not stay here again.....you have been warned.",None

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,3,Spacious but noisy,"An apartment suite with a direct Sea view balcony which was the best part. Bed was very comfortable.  Suite had full kitchen but no pots/pans, bowls etc. so can't use.  Not sure why you would build full kitchen with range and then not have amenities. No TV in bedroom, just in front of sofa in living room.

WiFi was poor as it kept breaking up.  No real access to beach (unless walk around) since gate is closed to stop vendors from coming in to pool area.  This was a real disappointment since I love the beach and not pool.  This could have been fixed by having a security guard at gate.

The worst part was waking up to church bells at 6am every morning.  Perhaps a suite on the other side of building would be a little more peaceful, but is a problem if you are a light sleeper.",Couples

Negombo,The Beach Apartments,3,Not set up for guests,"Our first stop in Sri Lanka and only for 1 night as we had been told Negombo was nicer than Colombo. The view of the beach was lovely and the rooms were great for the price which was about £70 a night. Although, we had to wait for our room to finish being cleaned when we arrived and we didn’t have towels in the room as they hadn’t come back from the laundrette yet. The pool area didn’t have a bar and we had to ask for even a soft drink. I don’t think they serve alcohol at all as we noticed the rooftop restaurant said BYOB. We swerved and went to a local one (the claws) down the road. If you want breakfast, you also have to let them know the day before as it seemed like they wouldn’t be set up otherwise. The local beach bars about 50m away were really good, although tonnes of stray dogs and crows. This hotel is missing a trick not having their own beach area!",Friends
Negombo,The Beach Apartments,4,More than i expected,"The room was outstanding. I booked just a couple of hours before I arrived and everything was immaculate. The room was so spacious with complete kitchen and lounge area, each room was enormous and equipped with everything that I needed. The staff were so friendly and helped me whenever they could. The hotel in general is quite small but I enjoyed that quiet. Easy to walk to the beach and I chose to walk to local restaurants in the evening and didn't feel uncomfortable and a single young woman. Close for local attractions such as the fish market. Internet was generally fine. Breakfast was also ok but I didn't eat there at any other time. I would just say that I like to be about early and the outside pool area wasn't ready for use until mid-morning, even just for relaxing. Also, it wasn't clear that the spa was a 10min drive, I had a full body massage and I didn't enjoy it, except the facial.",Solo

Colombo,Hilton Colombo,5,Delicious Lunch and Tea at Hilton,"The Hilton Colombo is one of the best hotels in Sri Lanka. The main gate faces York Street and will be easy to find with the signs. They will check your vehicle before you enter the premises, after which, you can drop your passengers off at the main entrance while you go and park in either the above-ground car park or their underground one. You must allow security to scan your bags and guide you through a metal detector before entering the lobby. The hotel is wheelchair-accessible and family-friendly. Aside from it being a hotel, there are a lot of other facilities, activities, and amenities available here such as restaurants, lounges, wifi, and water features to name a few. Additionally, everything was maintained well, the hygiene was top-tier, and the customer service and staff hospitality was great.
It was rather peaceful with a formal setting when I and my family went to both the Graze Kitchen and the L.A.B. lounge for lunch and tea. The food and drink in both were delicious, with good dessert options and the quality was excellent. If you ever go, I recommend the Chinese food options in Graze and the Cookies at L.A.B.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Wonderful relaxing stay and the best beach in Pasikudah,"We stayed at the hotel in early June, and everything was great. The hotel is cozy, with plenty of greenery, flowers, and local wildlife. We stayed in a standard superior room and it's good, though some rooms might be a bit “tired” and could use furniture updates. Housekeeping was available daily upon request.

The food was delicious - we were lucky to have a buffet almost every day, and even the à la carte dinners were excellent! Even without an all-inclusive package, there were plenty of fruits and non-alcoholic drinks. But if you drink a lot of water, be prepared to ask the staff for extra bottles, as the standard allocation is two 0.5L bottles per day. 

Objectively, the best beach along the entire coast - clean with a gentle entry into the ocean. The staff was wonderful - special greetings to Ayesh and Danujan.

This is a perfect place for a peaceful getaway. Few people, stunning landscapes, breathtaking sunrises - we would gladly return.

p.s. There are a few local dogs near the hotel, and we unfortunately witnessed, to put it mildly, inhumane treatment of them by beach staff. That is not ok! When we told our concerns, the response was that the dogs bark and disturb guests, though, in our experience, they caused no trouble.

What’s even more impressive is that we didn’t even have to visit the venue beforehand. The team at the resort took full responsibility for organizing most aspects of the event, and they did a phenomenal job.

A special thanks goes to Mr. Aththanayake and the entire management team, who were incredibly helpful throughout the planning process and on the day itself. The service from the crew was exceptional. we truly felt like everything was taken care of with great attention and care.

The food was delicious, and the overall experience made us feel genuinely special and celebrated.

After the wedding, we stayed on as a couple for two more days, and the surprises kept coming. romantic outdoor dinners, a beautifully arranged honeymoon room setup, and many more thoughtful touches that made our stay unforgettable.

We are so grateful to the Anantaya team for making our special day and the days after feel magical. Highly recommended for anyone planning a romantic getaway!",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,4,April Stay,"The stay was overall pretty good. The food was decent and the beach was lovely. Would have liked to see better food options for the buffet though.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Anantaya in April 2025,"Had a lovely stay! The room was clean and comfortable, and the beach and pool areas were just perfect for relaxing. The food was decent, though there’s room for improvement. What truly stood out was the staff—exceedingly warm, attentive, and helpful throughout. Their service made all the difference. Would definitely consider coming back!",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,2,Disappointing,"Pros
The staff were warm, friendly, and helpful.
The beach is absolutely beautiful.

Cons
Very limited food options — definitely not up to 5-star standards.
Rooms are poorly maintained; balconies were dirty with bird droppings, and the bathroom setup was below expectations.
Rooms had a noticeable moldy smell.
Pillows and mattresses were uncomfortable and in need of replacement.
The property had a significant pigeon issue, resulting in excessive bird droppings in common areas.
Basic room checks were not conducted — no hot water in the bathroom initially, and the TV remote didn’t have working batteries.
Despite traveling with a toddler, we were given a room on a higher floor far from the dining area. Requests for a lower-floor room were declined due to supposed unavailability, showing a lack of basic empathy and training.
We had to wait over an hour for hot water just to take a shower.
After escalating the issue to the supervisor, we were finally offered a room on a lower floor — contradicting what the front desk had previously told us.
The property has friendly dogs, which some guests might find bothersome. However, the real issue is the hotel's lack of care — the dogs aren’t fed or looked after and rely on guests for food scraps. Given the amount of food waste at the property, this is something the management should address.

Would I return?
Definitely not.",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Great stay as always,"We are always so well looked after every time we visit Anantaya, hence why we come back atleast once a year.

From the security officers in front of the hotel to the managers level all were so friendly and polite. They made our kids smile all the time they meet. The lady receptionist was very professional and polite, and she explained us the hotel facilities. Then we were taken to the lounge for welcome drinks. I personally loved the mirrors in the lobby washroom. Lobby washrooms were super clean. We met a very nice gentleman at the lounge Mr. Asela and he was very friendly and polite. He assist us with the rooms and the rooms were super clean and spacious. Specially we need that as we have 2 kids who love to play on the floor 🤩. We enjoyed our evening by the rooftop pool and the jacuzzi…. And it was very relaxing.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,1,Unpleasant experience. Not recommending,"Very disappointing experience. 
Despite all the negative reviews on Anantaya resort passikuda in booking.com and other places, we decided to stay at anataya thinking it can’t be that bad. It truly was a bad experience. Because March is off season, the resort has put all the training staff in place . While this is completely okay, the management should make sure the service and the environment is still upto standard. For the price we paid, we expected a certain standard but we faced number of unpleasant experiences. below are few which sounds small but caused delays and inconvenience 

NEGATIVES 
- the rooms weren’t that clean 
- coffee was unavailable in the room and had to call few times to get some 
- the locker in one of the rooms wasn’t working. After calling number of times, someone came to fix it but couldn’t fix and gave up. 
- phone in one of the rooms wasn’t working properly to request room service or content the reception 
- the delux room we got didn’t have any chairs to sit outside. 
- balconies were dirty
- we ordered lunch and waited for over one hour for the food to be delivered. We were told the training staff was cooking and that’s why. This was unacceptable. 

In addition, the food was not tasty 

POSITIVES 
- beach and the pool was nice 

FEW RECOMMENDATIONS 
- lots of dogs inside the resort near the pool area. Always fights and barks at each other. While dogs lovers are okay with this, not all visitors like this. It creates a bad atmosphere to the hotel. 
- would be nice to have more bins in the room 
- food quality and standard couldn’t improve 
- restaurant needs to be more efficient 
- should put some chairs on ground floor outside to sit on. Without chairs, that area is useless 
- make sure tea, coffee and sugar is fully restocked 

Unless management takes time to consider these points and make an important, unfortunately I cannot recommend anantaya to others.",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,We loved it!,"A colossal hotel for those who want a peaceful and quiet vacation. We went exactly for that and got it. We were very worried about some bad reviews about the restaurant, but believe me, they are nonsense. The kitchen is colossal! We ate both the HB buffet and the regular menu for a fee. Both are good. Portions are large! Everything is delicious. Everyone is very welcoming and helpful. The pool is very large and colossal.
Yes, the hotel is a bit outdated and in places you can see it, but that's a trifle. There is no typical European 5* hotel in Sri Lanka.
We were also in the hotels next door. And we were convinced that this is the coziest, greenest and most beautiful. The minus is that the SPA is under renovation, but that was a trifle. We enjoyed the SPA services in the hotel next door.",Couples
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,A Home Away from Home – Our Favorite Beach Getaway!,"Pasikudah has always been a special place for us, and Ananthaya Hotel feels like home. This was our 5th stay at Ananthaya Pasikudah and our 17th visit to Pasikudah—we absolutely love the beach!

One of the main reasons we keep returning is the exceptional service. The staff truly make a difference, and we have to mention Lahiru, the restaurant captain. If you’re visiting with kids, be sure to speak to him—he goes out of his way to ensure everything is perfect. Our kids adore him and the entire team! If you ever have any issues with food or service, Lahiru is the person to talk to—he will make your holiday even more special. Since meeting him, we’ve been coming back every four months!

We always book the pool access room, which is ideal for families. The kids love having easy access to the pool, making their stay even more enjoyable.

Another must-do when staying here is the morning beach walk. It’s the best time to see the fish and watch the fishing boats bringing in their fresh catch—a truly peaceful and beautiful experience.

A huge thanks to Ranika, the General Manager, who is always available to help with anything. His personal touch and commitment to guests make a big difference.

If you're looking for a relaxing, family-friendly beach getaway with excellent hospitality, Ananthaya Pasikudah is the place to be! We can’t wait for our next visit.",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,3,Not at all a 5 star experience. Stay but don't dine!,"Here's my detailed review of Anantaya Kalkudah. 

Needs Improvement: The buffet selection was lacking given the price and star rating of the property. The team does try but they just don't have a premium offering and its really disappointing. The buffer is sparse for options and lacks a 5 star / premium feel. Hands down the worst spread I've seen of any 5 star hotel across the island. The beach towels offered by the property are REALLY bad, almost rags felt awful drying ourselves off with them.  

Good: The pool is quite spacious. The rooms are also spacious but we had a few minor issues: plug points not working, water ponding in the shower etc. Overall they need better maintainence and upkeep. 

Excellent: The airconditioning in the room is excellent. Its powerful and cold. The staff are generally very pleasant but they're in a complete cost cutting mode and they're trying to spend the least, price the most with the hopes that guests will be OK with what's offered. 

Overall, I would choose Maalu Maalu, Amaya Beacg, Uga Beach or Calm before you consider this property! It should be your last resort all things equal.",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Best stay ever!,"One of the best stays I’ve ever had! Exemplary levels of customer service! Great location - right by the beach! Would definitely stay here again!

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Fantastic Hotel and Wonderful Escape,"We had a great experience staying at this hotel! The location is beautiful, although it is a bit far from Colombo.

During our stay, we celebrated a birthday, and the team went above and beyond by baking a cake and making the celebration so special. It was truly heart-warming and memorable.

Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable escape - relaxing, fun, and filled with great hospitality. Highly recommend!",Family
Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,3,Sri Lankan Bali,"Ananthaya Resort in Pasikudah truly feels like a slice of heaven. The stunning architecture and beautifully designed rooms make it a standout destination. The pool suites are particularly remarkable, offering a luxurious and serene experience. The main pool area is breathtaking, with an ambiance that might remind you of Bali, creating an ideal spot for relaxation and picturesque moments.

The service was exceptional, with staff who were attentive and welcoming throughout our stay. However, the food was a major letdown. For a high-end hotel of this caliber, the buffet offerings were below average and did not meet expectations. While everything else at the resort was perfect, the dining experience was disappointing.

If you’re visiting Ananthaya Resort, it’s best to plan for meals outside the property. Despite the food issue, this place is a must-visit for its incredible atmosphere, architecture, and top-tier hospitality. A little improvement in the dining department would make it flawless.",Couples

From the restaurant captain and his assistant to the chef and F&B manager, everyone went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. They constantly checked in with us to see if we had any issues or needed anything extra, responding swiftly to all our requests. Being a picky eater, I was impressed by how they adapted the set menu to suit my preferences, even preparing special dishes for me during the buffet.

We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday, and they made it truly memorable by offering us a complimentary cake with candles and beautiful bed decorations.

The entire booking process was seamless, done online through email, with prompt replies to all my queries.

The location is fantastic compared to other hotels in the area, and the large swimming pool with a pool bar adds great value to the experience. The rooms were spacious with a calming lighting setup, which made our stay even more enjoyable.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,3,A low point of holiday,"This place could be beautiful and special but it’s just not…. It looks well designed and appealing but really lets itself down. 
Firstly I don’t know if they have problems with guests not paying but having to sign for drinks ( a bottle of water!) before it even arrives at the start of a meal - our first restaurant experience - was unusual. Being asked pretty much every mealtime over a  3 day stay which room we were in ( ok but there were only about 10 guests as it was end of season) equally surprising. 
Food was pretty poor - we ended up complaining to the chief of waiting staff so the chefs were then brought  out so we could repeat ourselves snd they could apologise. 
There are large areas of the hotel ( seafood restaurant clearly visible from the only restaurant) which staff admit haven’t been open in literally years, all of which gives a feeling of desertion and lack of investment. 
The restaurant staff as a whole all seem pretty inexperienced - certainly very different to the other 7 hotels we stayed in over our 17 day holiday. 
Overall we had a fantastic trip to Sri Lanka and would definitely come back,  but this was a low point - we should’ve gone to Uga bay further down the coast.",Couples
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,5,Outstanding service and the best stay,"I have been to Trinco blu on so many occasions and each time this place gets better and better. Since GM Fowme Ibrahim took over it's been absolutely fantastic. I can personally attest to the excellence and changes he brought to this hotel. Being a World traveler across all six continents on a regular basis, Trinco blu by Cinnamon has always exceeded my expectation. Specifically since Fowme became the GM. 
At checkin there were so many people waiting to get checked in, but I was amazed the way they welcomed people and made them feel like at home. Shobana was great in welcoming me and also Naturalist Gamini went out of his way to make the process smooth and efficient. And he kept checking on me even at the dining areas. This was simply beyond 5**** plus. Chef Viraj personally greeted me and was willing to help me have a great culinary experience. Out of all the meals I certainly enjoyed breakfast the most, because there so many healthy options so well prepared. I really enjoyed the manioc with chicken curry lunu miris, Katta Sambol with boiled eggs, which was deliciously prepared by the chef. The breeze from the beach and the top quality service from Nesithma whom I found so passionate about people and she served with great joy and care. She really stood out as genuine server along with Sandeepa, Saseevan jayanthan and Siva who were top class in the area of hospitality and service.

The rooms were fabulous and looked over the beach; there was a tap outside each room so you could wash your feet before entering; fabulous bathroom and linen; small fridge in the room; outdoor seating area including a day bed.

Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Niche product southern Sri Lanka worth a,This is our second stay at the property. Clearly one of the best resorts in Sri Lanka the only one of a kind high end resort attached to an international brand like Hilton. This is a beautifully designed high end property located in the YALA national park buffer zone. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. In this resort the executive chef Tissera had a carefully crafted menu which appealed to our palate whilst retaining the identity of Sri Lankan food. He and the sous chef Majid were very gracious to source lake prawns as it was my desire to eat this dish before leaving the island and they went over and beyond to source it for us. NO was not in the vocabulary at this hotel and chef Tissera was no exception. It is nice to see more Hilton properties pop in the island.A special mention about the GM Githanjalee who personally intervened to  ensure we had a pleasant stay. Special mention of Indika who was extremely pleasant and went over beyond to accommodate us. Overall an excellent stay with pleasant memories and will look forward to our next visit.,Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,An absolutt perfect christmas vecation,"Me, my wife snd lur Two kids (7 and 10 year old) had the priveledge to spend our christmas holliday at this amazing hotel. we were impressed by the quality of the resort from the moment we came through the doorsteps. the food was amazing, the pool was absolute stunning, and all the personell realy gave an effort to take care of you. they eaven had arranged for santa clause to come during christmas eave dinner, and gave alle the kids pressents. we had the morning safari, and our ranger told us everything we wanted to know. they had also arranged for ticket inside the park, so we did not have to wait in line like all others who had only booked standard safari trip by themself. and the line was loong!

 Was also funn for all of us to see the monkey’s sitting in the tree’s just outside the deck on our room.

The rooms at the hotel is among the top level i have been to. the feeling of luxury and calm athmosphere is realy impressive at this resort. thank you Hilton Yala to give us a momorable christmas at your resort",Family

Stay was exceptional in all ways.  Starting with excellent and always present management and an exceptional service team  and ending with beautiful modern infrastructure , all in a very authentic and enchanting environment.

We had two Safari drives with our ranges Sangay, both of which were great and a leopard was spotted !

Will visit again next time.",Family
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,5,Spectacular In Every Way,"My husband and I visited The Hilton for a much needed nature escape for a week. We can’t properly express our immense gratitude for the Yala Resort team and the incredible treatment that made our trip spectacular. 

I’m a very detailed planner, and had no idea how absolutely inclusive and five star this property was until we arrived. The check in process was so breezy with a gorgeous upgraded villa, and the staff gave us such a warm welcome overseen by an obvious pro, Vino, the front desk manager. Asela always had a buggy ready to take us to our room and always ensured we were having whatever we needed for our stay - his smile was infectious!

Our villa had a private pool in the jungle with the ocean in the background and had every thoughtful amenity you could imagine. The property is only a year old so it is perfectly clean and divine. Beautiful lighting, makeup mirrors, a deep soaking tub, a pillow menu for whatever your needs require, umbrellas, and technology for anything you need. Cushy towels, nice robes, slippers, flip flops, bath salts, and the most expensive and technologically advanced toilet I’ve ever seen. Our housekeeping staff, Tharidu and Kasun were genuinely wanting to ensure we had everything we needed everyday and kept our room spotless and comfy all day long. The property is also plastic free which we absolutely loved and respected. Even the room keys are wood and they are leading the way with sustainability efforts. The resort pool is gorgeous and plenty of room for privacy, especially since there’s only 42 rooms here. Very exclusive vibe and personalized service. 

We pre booked 6 days worth of safaris and were lucky enough to be with our expert guide, Pazindu, and safari driving expert, Thushara every day. Getting to know these guys and know we were in good hands made us feel safe and excited to learn about Sri Lankan culture nature every day. It was really important to us to respect nature and the environment instead of the normal side of the road guys racing through the park to get a good look at whatever was there. These guys took us to remote areas, found us beautiful birds, rare sightings, elephants, leopards, and jackals and ensured we even picked up local spot experts who knew even more- to share facts, conservation work, and migration patterns of the birds that they were thrilled to see alongside us. Instead of a driver just taking you for a ride - you have a driver and a personal guide sitting with you to spot animals and take pictures for you so you can just enjoy the experience and live in the moment. They had rain jackets, coconut water, more snacks than you could ever need, and bincoulars - you literally don’t need to bring anything. We did a beach walk, dune walk, Block 1, 5, 6, Bundala Park, and Sithulpawwa. All so beautiful and different ways to see and experience culture and nature. 

The icing on the cake was Chef Jerome and his staff in the kitchen. Some of the absolute best food we’ve had in years. Beautiful presentations, local ingredients, and flavors that remind you how food should taste. He encouraged us to order off menu and took our requests and preferences into consideration when making us personalized meals. We’re so lucky to have eaten his food for a week and we’ll be chasing those flavors forever. Chanaka, Dilanka, and Indika made our meals special with fantastic service and genuine interest in making sure we had a great experience. One of the days we booked the full day safari with bush banquet - although expensive it is absolutely worth every penny - Hiran and the entire team cooked us the best meal in the middle of a jungle. It’s a must do! 

There’s nothing I would change about this property (except maybe Netflix streaming on the tv since i normally fall asleep to old favorite shows). Truly a spectacular once in a lifetime experience to feel so welcomed by this team - THANK YOU everyone who made us feel like family.",Couples
Palatupana,Hilton Yala Resort,4,Great hotel for a vacation at Yala,"Pluses - 
very nice pool, rooms - very practical and with all amenities
Spa was very inviting and nicely built in a very spacious building and it has a good atmosphere - it also has all other amenities - e.g. steam room, sauna, gym 
Organized Safari was quite good. 

Observations 
Staff were quite ok, wth few outstanding ones. The most outstanding employee was Mr Isuru at the main restaurant, who was very much ahead of others and one of the best that I have met  at a restaurant. Others worth mentioning were Sahastra and Prabuddha. Also, the Ranger, Praneeth, who accompanied us on the Safari
The beach is not good,unlike at Uga Chena Huts. 

Things that can be improved
Staff can be a bit more genuinely friendly and more professional, like Isuru
Although some food dishes were outstanding, some were unfortunately quite ordinary, e.g. the Watalappan",Family

Colombo,Hilton Colombo,1,Worst Check In Experience and rude Front Office Manager in anywhere in the world,"I have been a Gold Hilton Honors member for many years and have consistently received exceptional hospitality from Hilton properties worldwide. Despite also holding Gold status with Marriott and Platinum Ambassador status with IHG, Hilton has always been my preferred brand—until my recent experience at Hilton Colombo, which was by far the worst treatment I have ever received at check-in.

While the door staff, bell desk, and restaurant teams were courteous and efficient, the Front Office Manager, Natal, was shockingly rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. He refused to acknowledge my Honors status and denied any upgrades or benefits, falsely claiming that because I hadn’t booked through the Honors app, I wasn’t entitled to them. This is simply not true, as I have accumulated 540K+ Honors points through extensive Hilton stays.

Even more concerning, when I questioned this, he stated that all guests are treated the same, regardless of loyalty status. This completely disregards Hilton’s commitment to rewarding its most loyal customers. Loyalty programs exist to recognize and appreciate returning guests, not to treat them like any random walk-in.

Due to this appalling service, we canceled our five-night reservation and moved to Colombo Marriott—where the experience was a complete contrast. Marriott immediately recognized my Elite Gold status, offered lounge access, extra points, complimentary cocktails, and high tea throughout our stay. On top of that, the rate was $50 lower than Hilton, and the hotel itself was far more modern and well-maintained.

I strongly advise all Hilton Honors members to avoid Hilton Colombo until they address the rudeness and lack of customer service at their front desk. Multiple reviews highlight similar issues, and it’s clear that Natal is not suited for any customer-facing role.

Moving forward, we will not return to Hilton Colombo and will shift all personal and corporate stays to Colombo Marriott, where loyalty is genuinely valued.",Business

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Hidden Gem in the Jungle – Amazing Experience!,"The location is absolutely beautiful – surrounded by nature, a peaceful river, and the jungle all around. The chalets were really nice and felt quite luxurious, though the rooms could use a bit of a refresh. Still, the setting is so special that it makes up for it.

The staff were super friendly and helpful, always willing to go the extra mile. Most of them are ex-army, so while they’re great at getting things done, the service could be a bit personal with some more hospitality-focused training.

Honestly, for the location and experience, the resort is seriously underpriced – great value for money.

The best part of the trip was the waterfall trek. The guides were amazing – really kind, made sure everyone was safe, and took us through the jungle, over rocks, and right to the waterfall where we could explore and have fun. It was the perfect mix of adventure and nature.

Overall, this place feels like a hidden paradise. If you love nature and are up for something a bit different, this place is a must-visit. We loved it and would definitely go back!",Friends

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,1,Ella Jungle Resort ruined our holiday!!!,"We selected this property mainly to ride their cable car and enjoy the river flowing by the property and a trek. 
However, when we were about just one hour to the property. The receptionist notified us that the cable car is broken and that we have to take the treacherous walk to the property from the car park. And that we were not advised to walk back after drinks at night after the visit to Ella town. They offered no other alternative. Finally after an expensive journey in a Kangaroo chauffer driven car, we were stranded without a place to stay. Thankfully we found accommodation in the best property in Ella. 
The Millon dollar question is..
1). If the cable car broke down aearly morning. Why didn't the property inform us about the breakdown before we left Colombo at 11 am? 
2). I have been trying to call the property for three days before the booking. No one answered the phone. 
3). The receptionist Mr Lalith Dissanayake mentioned that the property belongs to the Ravana Valley Group and that the Reservations Manager Mr. Chaminda Prasad requested us (the client) to call him to discuss cancellation. I insisted that he call me. That call never came. And Lalith promised that the booking will be cancelled without debittimg my credit card on Chaminda's orders. However this was not confirmed. Action is pending. I still see the booking as active on bookings.com.",Couples
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Fabulous jungle resort!!! What an experience ❤️,"Into the Wild: A Hidden Gem in the Heart of Ella

What a fabulous jungle resort! Ella Jungle Resort is truly one-of-a-kind — a perfect blend of adventure, comfort, and nature. The entire experience was absolutely mind-blowing. The rooms are rustic yet elegant, and bathrooms were basic but big. Beds are comfortable, and to our surprise, not a single mosquito in sight — a jungle miracle!

The staff deserves a special mention — always prompt, courteous, and ready to help with a smile. The food was delicious and satisfying, perfect after a long day of exploring.

Getting to the resort itself is an adventure — a bumpy dirt road followed by a thrilling ropeway ride sets the tone for an unforgettable stay. Don’t miss the waterfall trek and the zip line — both are exhilarating and give you a true taste of the wild.

Highly recommend this hidden treasure for anyone looking to disconnect and soak in the beauty of Sri Lanka’s jungles.",Friends
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,2,Poor Quality of Rooms and Facilities,"We visited the Ella Jungle Resort in Feb 2025 and this was a big disappointment.  We had two cottage rooms above each other (Room 8A and 8B) and the state of the room was pathetic.  The location and surroundings are picturesque within heart of nature.  However the rooms are are badly designed with poor lighting and amenities.  For the price charged this was a clear rip-off.  Visible signs of poor maintenance and hygiene.  Bathrooms are equally badly designed with no planning as well with low pressure of water.

Food quality was equally bad with small portions and lack of taste

The only saving grace was the prompt and efficient service by the local staff. Very courteous and tried to help inspite of all challenges.  Must compliment them for their attitude and helpful nature",Family

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,1,Terrible booking experience. Very poor and rude customer service,"We made a booking in 2020 and paid a Rs 21600 advance. But then the hotel closed possibly due to Covid and renovations and they were closed for a long time. After they opened,  we tried to contact them in all ways possible (telephone call, SMS, email, WhatsApp) to get a refund (as it was not our fault that the hotel couldn't honor the booking), and this went on for months. They would say they would check and get back but never did. Obviously, as we don't go to Ella that often, we just left it at that and waited to hear from them. We did send an occasional reminder though. Now, as we got a chance to go to Ella, we asked if they could let us use that advance. I got very blunt and rude replies saying that as the managing company has changed they can't do anything. Didn't even try to contact the previous company to see the possibility of getting our money back. Didn't even try to see this issue from the customer's perspective. Are customers responsible for management company changes? Don't they inherit the accounts from the previous company? Aren't they bound to honor bookings made by the previous people? Shouldn't they at least try to see from the customer's side and have the decency to send courteous replies? This was the last rude reply I got on WhatsApp  ""It's our responsibility to pay you which you made payment to another company 2020? You have to solve the issue at the same time. We are sorry and we can not do anything  with your payment. Pls don't text us regarding this anymore"".  The company name seems to be Ravana Valley Pvt Ltd.

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Checked in with my phone - checked out with my soul.,"I arrived at Ella Jungle Resort on the 2nd of January 2025 the way most modern people do: tethered to my phone, armored in city-bred skepticism, and nursing a carefully curated collection of TripAdvisor doubts. The exhaustion of 2024 sat heavy on my shoulders, while my WhatsApp pinged like tiny arrows of obligation against my consciousness. ""Are you free for a quick call?"" they chirped, each message a small paper cut to my already fraying nerves.

Then came the room mix-up. Oh, how gloriously I rose to that occasion! Like a seasoned performer, I unleashed the full symphony of urban indignation – complete with huffs, puffs, and the kind of entitled demands that make me cringe in retrospect. The staff's response? Pure grace. They met my disproportionate city rage with such gentle competence and genuine accountability that I felt my carefully constructed wall of irritation crumble into something resembling shame.

But here's the thing about Ella Jungle Resort – it doesn't judge. Instead, this hidden mountain valley simply wraps itself around you like a warm embrace from an old friend who knows exactly what you need. The cold mountain streams don't just cleanse; they perform a kind of spiritual cryotherapy, freezing those petty thoughts mid-formation until they shatter and float away with the current.

Let's be clear: if you're looking for the kind of place where thread counts matter more than authentic experience, this might not be your cup of Ceylon tea. For real – you're in the middle of the jungle, so yes, you'll have the occasional uninvited six-legged guest. But the rooms come with all the essentials: AC (though we never used it – the mountain air kept things perfectly cool, even requiring a blanket at night), fans, and reliable hot water. It's that sweet spot between wild and comfortable. If you are particular and need things to be just so, or you are in a mood, you may find a few things wanting - the upside is that all these things are on management's must-do-better list, and they seem genuinely determined. 

The magic here isn't in the amenities (though they're perfectly adequate) – every room overlooks the river that circles this 150-acre property. You dine under the stars around a campfire at night, and as peacocks dance in the old paddy field, and the cool mountain air blows in, you find yourself breathing more deeply and more gloriously than you have in months...possibly even years. It's in the way the land calls you and in the knowing smiles of the staff who've seen countless others like you slowly unfurl from their urban chrysalis, in the profound silence that fills the spaces between your thoughts.

And then there's the adventure. Here I am, a permanently anxious and constantly raging 46-year-old whose last meaningful relationship with fitness ended somewhere between Chemical Brothers and last orders at The Electric Ballroom circa 2004, soaring through the jungle canopy on a zipline. The old me would have crafted a dozen excuses, but something about this place makes you brave. Perhaps it's because the mountain air has already worked its magic, or maybe it's because you've remembered that life isn't meant to be lived through a screen and endless obligations in the rearview mirror – it's meant to be lived in moments of exhilarating, heart-pounding joy.

I came here season-weary and review-jaded; I left with my soul humming in harmony with the mountains. To those whose spirits are running on empty, whose minds are cluttered with the debris of modern life, whose hearts have forgotten the simple joy of just being – this place isn't just a resort - It's a reminder of who you were before the world told you to be busy all the time.

Come to Ella Jungle Resort not for what it is, but for what it allows you to become. Stay as long as your schedule permits, though be warned – you might find yourself renegotiating what ""schedule"" means after a few days here. And if you're reading this while simultaneously checking your work emails (I see you), book it now. Your future self, the one with quieter thoughts, softer edges, and perhaps a surprising taste for adventure, will thank you.

P.S. To the staff who handled my room-mix-up meltdown with such grace – I'm still sorry, and also deeply grateful. You were the first crack in my armor, and that's exactly what I needed.",Family

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Had an Amazing Holiday,Recently about two weeks back myself my wife and 3 year old son had an amazing holiday in Ella Jungle Resort. From the time of reservation till we checked out and get into vehicle to come back everything was just perfect. This is not a city hotel or a 5 star resort but just a hotel which is located in the middle of a jungle with lots of adventure activities which are totally free. The food was just amazing. If you expect a grand buffet like in a beach 5 star hotel or Colombo city hotel this is not the place. But if you like plated service with organic and Sri Lankan food this place is just ideal. Everyone there take care of you very well. From my view this is just perfect. I 100% recommend this place anyone who loves the nature 🙂,Family
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,1,"Terrible experience. Waste of time, money and nerves. Stay away.","Well, no.   Big no. 
First of all, before booking, please go through all these comments. Look at the pictures. Not posted by the property but from guest. The place have a great potential but as of today it is just a scam. Place is undeveloped, rooms are nasty. Food terrible. All three above aspects can be fixed easily and reading that this ""in a jungle"" makes no sense. We travel to Sri Lanka often, staying in boutique hotels but also in a real jungle. All places can be clean and nice disputing the fact of not easy environment around. Same w/ food. Staying ""in a jungle"" explain nasty food served? Having so many option for low-key or upscale Sri Lanka' culinary possibilities? 

So we did claim many times issues on site. Zero interest. Management's reaction: it is what it is, deal with it. 
Immediate decision to leave. After one night in dirty room and without even touching a breakfast. 

Now it gets more interesting.. When I wanted to set a review on booking.com it turned that ... we have not stayed there. Ella Jungle Resort just canceled our stay, after the payment was taken. Now I understand the GM laugh on the phone and the answer ""good luck with the reviews, hahahah"". 

This is so fUp that such terribly managed places w/ the attitude as they have presented, in such beautiful country are making trips for tourists so unpleasant. I love Sri Lanka. We'll be back regardless. But I hope bs spots will despair from the accommodation map sooner than later.

Random pictures and management actions (then and now) should say more than this entire review.",Couples
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Must visit when in Ella,"I don't why there are negative reviews. it's a jungle resort and it lived to its expectations. you can't be staying in a luxury property in middle of jungle. arrival experience is amazing. adventure starts right from there. room is spacious and clean. view from balcony to stream is next to amazing. Best thing is the staff they treats you like king and makes you feel very special. very friendly and always ready to do whatever you ask. no is something I didn't hear.

my 9 year old son enjoyed the activities also and last bath at river stream is most rejenuvating in our entire srilankan trip.

the chef you received us on arrival and isuru at reception were great. no doubt everyone else is equally good.

don't go by negative reviews. if you can walk and climb and need a different experience for your kids take then here. they will enjoy.",Family
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,1,Frustrated,"I am writing this with great frustration. 
Ella jungle resort gave us and everyone present the worst possible experience. 
First of all the location and the nature is very beautiful. I am sad to say it’s in wrong hands. On arrival the room condition was very bad. 
1. Toilet comods not cleaned 
2. Ant infestation everywhere 
3. No water supply 
4. Definitely no hot water 
5. No AC to all the rooms 
6. Towels wet 

Anyways we somehow managed and tried take a wash with the little water we got and go have dinner. 
At this point, we were super hungry following the tiring ride to the resort from the main road. 
But most of the items were over or almost over. Initially there was a few devilled chicken left. Once asked to restock it they brought devilled prawns and not chicken ( that also after a very long time) for a meat dish it was only the devilled prawns after that. For people with seafood allergy just eat the rice only?  because other dishes were also empty.  There was ice cream but no bowls to eat. 
Plates, cutleries, cups were not washed properly and there is no one at the buffet to check and restock the finishing plates, cutleries and food. No one nearby area to call also. Under the plates full of oil and noodle pieces on top of the plate  as they were not washed properly. 
We had to go to the buffet and keep on standing until we got something to eat. When we got something to eat we had to then stand waiting for plates. 

Since we had to experience this at the start we already made a complaint through whatsapp to the one who was taking the bookings. So that they will correct themselves and the next breakfast , lunch and the next day will be treated properly for the price we paid to get the so called 3 star hotel experience as mentioned by them. 
The reply I got from the operator was… “NOT allowed to have bites in buffet” 
So, i said yea no need to have bites in buffet if we can have dinner that’s enough. 
So the hotel team has informed her that some people are having bites from the buffet that is why this whole problem raised.
She never apologised or corrected the issue. 
Some other person not having bites is not the solution for all the problems I mentioned above. Even if they had bites, there is a limit a person can eat and for the money they took they are responsible enough to provide us with enough food specially when we were away from the main road. 
The full amount was already paid to confirm the booking. 
As all the guests couldn’t bear the frustration they tried to talk to the two so called managers called Isuru and Ajith. 
They too never apologised or tried to correct themselves. They are saying that the problem is this going under the name as hotel. This should be an adventure zone it seems. If this is an adventure zone, they cannot be charging such high prices and even if this is an adventure zone they cannot keep the guests starving like how we did for the dinner. Ajith is also saying that for one day become vegetarian and enjoy. If you expect the guests to eat vegetarian for the price they paid please add more vegetarian dishes without letting them eat only rice. 
Mr. Ajith’s behaviour is definitely not suitable for a manager over there. He doesn’t know how to behave. He is always trying to rule the guests and try to be the boss like an army commander over there. May be because the owner of the place is a commander? Under the term of hotel hospitality you cannot rule the guests and talk to them in rough tone and command them over things. The isuru the other manager is saying he will send all the staff home tomorrow because the issue to this problem is the innocent ground staff. 
From what I heard soon after an incident like this happens what they do is chase away the ground staff without even paying them their salary as if they are responsible for what happened. Yes the staff over there is not skilled enough for a three star resort. If you charge such amounts and advertise your business in such a way please also spend appropriately to give the best possible service, food and experience for the guests without being only profit oriented. Upon departure we had to wait for hours sleeping on the lobby until the cable car + jeep took us to the main road. They didn’t even let us stay on the room until their lorry is ready. On arrival we got a safari jeep but for departure we got a lorry. 
They do so much cost cutting here. 
They do not think about the time and value of it on guests. We had to leave with so much frustration and hunger. Soon after leaving the first thing we did was to go to the most nearest pol roti shop and eat. Where we got so tasty food and our stomaches got full. For everything I have mentioned I have evidence from screenshots, recordings and video clips. I hope they correct themselves because the nature over there is nice. 
But, I have also experienced similarly or even better more beautiful natural places for a lower budget and with great food and service. First of all the owner of this place should correct himself. I hope Ella Jungle Resort will soon correct themselves from cheating the guests. For everyone who is planning to go there, please think twice.",Family
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,2,Disappointing Experience Despite Great Location,"Disappointing Experience Despite Great Location

Our recent stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing, despite its fantastic location. The initial impression was positive, especially with the cable car experience, but everything went downhill once we entered our room.

Upon arrival, we found two used towels on the bed, which was quite unsettling. We requested fresh towels, but even then, there was no hot water available, making it impossible to enjoy a warm shower in the freezing cold. To add to our frustration, the room lacked basic amenities such as tissues—there was only an empty tissue box.

The cleanliness of the room was another major issue. The bed was covered in dirt and dead ants, forcing us to do our own housekeeping. This is simply unacceptable. To top it all off, dinner was terrible, making the entire experience even more regrettable.

It’s clear that the staff responsible for maintaining the property are not taking their duties seriously. This lack of responsibility and attention to detail left us with a negative impression of what could have been a great stay.",Friends
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,5,wonderful experience,"We stayed last weekend at Cinnamon blue which was an unforgetable experience. Location itself was stunning with a large pool. Dining was top knotch and the restaurant and kitchen staff was very attentive. Only point we didnt like was the front desk. Kanishka was exceptional, upon arrival he guided us to the restaurant immediately since the rooms were not ready at the moment. we didnt expect rooms to be ready since we checked in for lunch, after lunch when we returned to the front desk and we experienced a very slow check in process ( shanika) even though our rooms were ready, Mr. Ravi got interfere to the situation and contacted house keeping and made the process faster. We were not in a hurry but we have experienced generally how long it takes for a check in. ( front desk was not busy at that moment) at the check out also Shanika from front desk was unable to add points to my account and she messed up it with another room number which was under my name. i am not worrying about points or nothing against shanika, we had a wonderful experience as i mentioned. but these little little things should be focused on.",Family

The whole vibe was so good in the entire resort.",Family
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,3,Could be so much better,"The main selling point of this hotel is the location - set right on a beautiful beach and a short walk to bars and local restaurants. The pool and beach have plenty of sun loungers but they're quite dated with peeling paint and some are losing their wheels. The hotel is really in need of some renovation and lacks the touches that could make it a really lovely hotel. The rooms are fine - big enough with plenty of storage - and fairly clean but our bathroom had patches of mould. The whole hotel felt like it needed a lick of paint and some nicer furniture. The view from the room was good though. 
The food was ok but the buffet seating area is bright and noisy so we didn't feel like it was a very relaxing experience. 
The receptionist who greeted us wasn't a great advert for the hotel either - he barely smiled a welcome, couldn't answer some basic questions, didn't explain anything and couldn't speak very good English. To be fair there were other staff members who were much more helpful - particularly when we wanted to visit the fort and he called us a tuktuk. 
I dont know if we were unlucky but the hotel was full of large groups when we went which meant long waits at the bar too. 
If you want to visit Tricomalee for a few days, this hotel is fine but it could be so much better. 
We would recommend walking down the beach to explore the other bars and cafes although some of them are really expensive.",Couples

Basically cannot find any negatives there.....!",Business
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,5,Great family vacation,"We stayed with the family, including me, my husband and 3 young kids - 5,6,9 years old. I stayed in this hotel once before at a standard room. Although all rooms have an ocean view, we opted to stay in beach bungalow. The room was very clean and comfortable with large balcony facing the sunrise. All amenities were available (hand made soap, body lotion with nice scent etc). The bed was very comfortable. I am a very choosy to pillows, but I was completely satisfied. Water in the room was replenished twice a day. 
As for the restaurant, I have never seen so many varieties of Sri Lankan dishes. We took FB meal since our kids are always hungry. The buffet has also included international dishes like chilli con carne, burgers, pasta carbonara). Deserts, fruit and cheese were really good. Cocktails in bar menu (“Cinnamon special”) surprised me much by their texture and unusual mixture of flavours.
The main speciality of the hotel is an incredible Maldives style beach with plenty of sunbeds and hammock hanging in the shade. The ocean was really calm. We were swimming and floating with the kids all day around. I recommend this hotel as a family friendly. 
I also enjoyed Balinese spa treatments in hotel spa. 
We had an individual trip by boat just from our beach to Pigeon Island. Hotel has a water sport center and diving school. We saw sharks and turtles at the national parks. It was an amazing trip.
All personnel were very kind and helpful and up to the standards of Cinnamon Hotel and Resorts network.",Family
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,5,A stay to remember!,"Our stay at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel's design and top-notch amenities made for a truly relaxing and enjoyable experience.

* Two ladies on the India-Sri Lankan live station Jasintha & Vijitha are hardworking & friendly. They both make the yummiest food.

* I'd want to thank Rajinthan for going above and beyond to ensure that our dining experience was exceptional. Also, Sameef, Niroshan & Mahesh's sincere welcome and excellent service made all the difference.

Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,3,Romantic Setting Ruined by Awful Food and Rude Staff,"Trinco Blu by Cinnamon – April 26, 2025

We recently stayed at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon and were impressed by the stunning location and serene ambiance. The room was spacious, luxurious, and impeccably clean, offering a peaceful retreat by the calm beach—an atmosphere we deeply appreciated.

However, our overall experience was marred by two significant issues.

1. Poor Food Quality:
The meals were very disappointing. Both dinner and breakfast lacked flavor and quality. While one cake at breakfast was passable, the rest were hard and dry. The string hoppers were particularly poor—dry, seemingly leftover, and not properly steamed. Dinner also failed to meet expectations, especially considering the reputation of the Cinnamon brand.

2. Unprofessional Checkout Experience:
We faced confusion during checkout regarding payment, despite having fully paid in advance through our travel agent. The front desk appeared unaware of this, leading to unnecessary delays. A staff member named Ms. Sidhara was especially unprofessional and rude, not only toward us but also to our guide. After the issue was resolved, we overheard her on a call saying, “release the guest,” which was deeply unsettling. It made us feel more like detainees than valued guests—language and behavior that are completely inappropriate in the hospitality industry.

In fact, we were supposed to extend our stay by one more day and had even started discussing it with our travel agent—but thank God we didn’t. Given the experience, we’re relieved we chose not to stay longer.

Having had positive experiences at other Cinnamon properties, this stay was particularly disappointing. We sincerely hope the management will address both the food quality and staff conduct to ensure a better experience for future guests.",Couples
Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,2,Not satisfied,Very bad. We have reserved king size bed superior room bt we got twin bed room. Its very uncomfortable to sleep. I had back pain also.

For lunch i have requested in room dining bt they said we dont alocate menu if you need food come to the restaurant and served in the plate and give to us we will take to the room. Bt thats not convenient. And aftr the lunch i requested the room service for clear the olayes bt they didn’t come to collect the plates until next day morning. Lunch is not good. Bf and dinner ok. Location is good with the great view. Staff ok.  We also paid in usd. Same like foreigners. Please consider the local also. You are giving priority to foreigners only.,None
Colombo,Nh Collection Colombo,1,don't complaint in restaurant that food is cold otherwise rest. MANAGER RUAN will shout on you.,"Subject: Formal Complaint Against Restaurant Manager Ruan – Unacceptable Conduct Toward Guest

Dear [Hotel/Restaurant Name] Management,

I am writing to formally lodge a serious complaint regarding an unacceptable incident that occurred during my recent visit to your restaurant. I was extremely disappointed and shocked by the behavior of your restaurant manager, Mr. Ruan, whose conduct was not only unprofessional but also deeply disrespectful.

During my meal, I noticed that the food being served at the buffet was consistently cold — not just one item, but every dish I sampled. As a paying guest, I felt it was well within reason to bring this matter to the staff’s attention, with the expectation that it would be addressed politely and professionally.

To my absolute dismay, when I raised this concern with Mr. Ruan, his immediate response was to raise his voice and shout at me in front of other guests. I remained calm and reminded him that this was not an appropriate way to speak to a customer. I asked him not to raise his voice and questioned if this kind of conduct reflected your hotel’s standards. Instead of correcting his behavior, he continued to argue and speak to me in an aggressive and disrespectful tone.

This escalation left me deeply embarrassed and uncomfortable. At one point, I had to ask him if I should leave my meal entirely or if he intended to continue his behavior — it was that confrontational. Eventually, your chef, Mr. Anuruddha, intervened and appropriately scolded Mr. Ruan for his behavior, at which point he finally left the scene.

While I appreciate Chef Anuruddha’s attempt to de-escalate the situation, the overall experience left a lasting negative impression on me. I came to your establishment expecting hospitality, not hostility.

I would like to ask:

What actions will be taken against Mr. Ruan for this incident?

What steps are being taken to ensure that no guest is treated like this in the future?

I strongly urge your management to provide immediate retraining or take disciplinary action against Mr. Ruan. No guest should ever be shouted at or humiliated for raising a legitimate concern — especially in a hospitality setting.

This incident has significantly impacted my view of your establishment, and I hope that you will take this matter seriously and respond accordingly.",Business

Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Amazing hospitality,"We had an amazing stay at this hotel during our trip with my husband and baby girl. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm hospitality and a refreshing welcome drink, setting the tone for a fantastic experience. The deluxe room exceeded our expectations with its elegant white-themed design, comfortable bed, spacious layout, and a beautifully designed bathroom. The breakfast spread was delicious and satisfying, and the pool was a perfect spot for relaxation. The exceptional customer service and attention to detail made our stay truly memorable. We will definitely be back again!",Family

Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,"A comfortable, welcoming and very relaxing experience which I can’t recommend enough.","An excellent hotel set on Mirissa Beach with walking distance to the stunning Coconut Hill. The hotel was cozy and staff very welcoming and friendly. The rooms were very comfortable, very clean and some excellent sea views. The pool was perfect for lounging and relaxing. The hotels restaurant is notable with some excellent local and international dishes, however, the breakfast is fantastic. All the staff at the hotel are warm and friendly and cannot do enough for you. A very relaxing stay.",Solo
Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,A true gem,"This place was a gem. We stayed here for three nights in the last week of March. Our room number was their namesake Triple O Six. Guessing it’s their best room. The ocean view from this room was fantastic. The bathroom was very spacious, with good fittings and had a jacuzzi facing the ocean.
The people manning the front desk were very helpful with info for planning our trips around Mirissa. The best part turned out to be their restaurant. We generally had an underwhelming experience with food in Mirissa. The wait times to get our orders were above an hour. Also, the restaurants nearby were highly rated but had small portion sizes or the quality was substandard for the cost. The online reviews for food options seem rigged based on our experience. The only exception was the delicious food we tried at Surfing Wombat and the long wait time here was bearable since our table had a great ocean view.
We decided to try the restaurant at Triple O Six. It is on the expensive side but far superior experience to other places in the vicinity. Better value for money, quantity and quality and importantly no hour-long wait time frustration for the food.
On the last day of our trip, we used the in-house pool. Clean well-maintained pool. Our positive experience was enhanced and we were thrilled to find an old-looking gold ring shining at the bottom. The reception told us that it looked quite valuable.
Overall, we had a good experience here.
The only con is that this place is not wheelchair friendly. There is a flight of stairs to the entrance of the reception. Saw a lady with knee issues struggling up those stairs and there was no alternate access.",Family
Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Good,"This hotel room is a true haven! From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with cozy comfort and impeccable cleanliness. The attention to detail is evident, from the fluffy towels to the thoughtful amenities like a mini-fridge stocked with refreshing drinks. The bed is a highlight, offering a cloud-like experience that guarantees a restful night's sleep. After a day of exploring the city, returning to this room feels like stepping into your own personal sanctuary. The stylish and modern decor adds to the ambiance, creating a welcoming atmosphere that instantly puts you at ease. And to top it all off, the view from the window is simply breathtaking, providing the perfect backdrop for unwinding after a busy day. Trust me, this hotel room is a hidden gem that you won't want to miss out on!",Couples
Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Courteous and beautiful,"Rooms are just so beautifully done and spacious. Being a boutique hotel, its not common to see so much thought gone into the rooms. We stayed in two different suites and both of them were just so thoughtfully done. And to talk about the location - right opposite to the famed Coconut Tree Hill, so much so, that you can actually see the hill from the room balconies. Though its a little away from Mirissa Harbour and the town, but honestly its not at all a big deal.

The breakfast spread was quite good considering the limited rooms in the hotel. And the best part - a very very courteous staff. You feel wowed by their kind gestures and courtesy.

Protip: If you are really into white decors - try their Sugar suite, and if you are looking for Jacuzzi on the balcony - go for the Spice suite. Both of them are on the same floor and have same views.",Family
Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Vacation  Mirrissa,"This is possibly the best hotel in Mirissa, with the best staff and high level service.  Delicious breakfasts, lots of fruit, always fresh juices.  The hotel is clean and always smells good)  They start cleaning the pool as early as 5 am and spend the whole day making sure not a single leaf falls there. Reception service 24/7. I want to sincerely thank Mr.Tharindu. Mr.Shai. Mr. Chaminda and Miss Kalpadi for their excellent job.
It’s always a pleasure to contact them. They are always ready immediately to help to solve all your problems. We liked everything very much, I think we will come back",Family
Mirissa,Triple O Six,4,"Nice hotel in a good location, close to Coconut Tree Hill","Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 young kids) stayed for 3 nights. Hotel is nice, new and very clean. We stayed in the Sugar Suite which was huge and nicely designed in a beach villa style. Staff were kind and generous. Location is great, <5 mins walk to Coconut tree hill. Breakfast was good, not great, but there are lots of options nearby so it’s not a big thing.",Family
Mirissa,Triple O Six,4,A gem in Mirissa,"We were a group of 10 people at this hotel for an over night stay. 

The hotel is a boutique hotel and a gem. From the time we checked in the staff were very hospitable and helpful. We checked in late but they sent us a snack to welcome us. 

Rooms and bathrooms are a good size and the suite is beautiful. Some rooms need a bit of maintenance (switch not working / toilet seat loose) but other wise very good. 

We had a whale watching tour in the morning before check out and requested a late check out. They gave us two rooms to keep late so we could freshen up before we left. Finally we did. It need to keep the rooms but it was a nice gesture. 

The hotel has a nice breakfast. Most of the group did not have breakfast but those that did said it was very good and service was good. 

Highly recommend this hotel in Mirissa. 👍 thank you to the staff.",Friends
Mirissa,Triple O Six,4,Triple o six out of ten,"A decent hotel …..Wouldn’t rate it as 5 blob but a steady 4 . Comfortable beds, well equipped bathrooms .
Things that could be improved I think , are the breakfasts. The hotel isn’t really big enough to warrant a buffet. A lot of the items weren’t very warm and generally it was better when it was served a La carte. 
The bar closed very early , wasn’t possible to get a drink after 10.30pm and the room items in the fridge were poor ( no bottle opener provided) 
Staff were pleasant, but generally it was a little bit soulless 
Would I return ?  I think there may be better options in Mirissa",Couples
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,1,"The best way to waste 50,000/= and Fuel by driving 6hrs & 200km from Colombo to Ella DON’T GO!","I believed in all the fancy things they boasted and posted on their Instagram and reserved this place for B&B on April 12th/13th days. In spite of the new year, they still accepted my booking at the same ongoing rate (50,000/= B&B).
During our journey we didn’t get single follow-up call from them to check whether we were safely on the way, that shows how less they care us. After reaching their Café at the bend Restaurant, we tried calling the resort contact Gayan to say that we have come, but he didn’t answer the phone ontime. So we went around the café to see if there is a security officer to inform that we have reached, but the Security Officer seated inside the café and he was deaf, his hearing was so bad and we had to speak too loud so that he would hear and understand what we say. And he wasn’t a presentable, attentive, supportive and vigilant security officer. 
This shows how negligent and careless they are about their security despite the fact the owner of the Resort being a retired Major in the SL ARMY. 
We had to wait for an hour for their Toyota Hi-lux truck to come and pick us to the resort. It was raining, and the truck’s condition was very bad, its roof was damaged and had holes. 
After we reached, we were given a welcome drink, since we personally had some health concern over certain food we consume, we inquired about the ingredients of the fruit drink. The waiter didn’t know what he served us nor did he want to ask the Chef. 
We were escorted to our room, and we came to know there was no hot water shower. Being  located in a cool climate area. So we had to have a shower in the freezing cold water. During the whole night there were power drops, we were in the dark many times, they didn’t have a generator. 
We order dinner from the a la carte menu in 3hrs in advance, but the food came only around 10pm. They gave an excuse saying they were short of staff due to sinhala  new year. But why do they undertake bookings then ? if they are unable to serve food or provide service on time ? 
When we woke up next morning, we realized there was no water in the tap.  We couldn’t use the toilet and we had no way of pooping or urinating.  The management didn’t know that the guests didn’t have water. We tried to call them, but their phone was switched off, so we had to come out of our room and walk all the way to the front reception area looking for a person to complain. So we disappointedly returned back to our room and walked down to the water stream near the resort (Kirindi Oya) and bathed and peed as well in the stream. Such a gross, unpleasant experience ever faced in life in my whole travel life. Then few hours later manager came and said tap is broken, no maintenance staff, they are getting water from the stream, som mud stuck in the T-joint blah blah. So we had to believe whatever he said. We were served a so called English type but very basic breakfast for the price we paid, two slices of toasted white bread, 4 tiny sausages , magarine and jam and omelet with spinach. No Coffee, No Tea, No fruit platter, No brown bread, no meat…They didn’t serve us water, but they had mineral water bottles, the glasses were full of ants. 
We finished our breakfast around 10am, and was going to check-out, Then we realized their cable car was not working due to some mechanical or electrical issue in the tractor engine they use to operate the cables. There was no mechanic to fix it, finally an old person called to be the Chairman of this resort came there 1hr later and he was trying all his skill to fix it. Fire sparks were coming out of the battery terminals and the engine of the cable car machine. Being a mechanic I was 100% sure it has not gone through regular maintenance of battery check-up. They didn’t even have a tool kit to diagnose the issue. While we were waiting for more than 1.5hrs, a retired major guy came tried to lame attempt to pacify us by giving a 150/= 2 FANTA bottles to pacify our frustration. But we rejected it saying we need to check-out ASAP. As were already wasted our money, time and energy which was worth more than 150rupees, and was very late for our next appointment while we were filled with anger and frustration.  
Cable car didn’t seem to be working, we were scared even if it starts working what would happen if  it suddenly stops in the middle in the air while on travel. So we decided to carry all our heavy bags o the shoulders walked on the shaky wooden bridge with great difficulty by balancing our body with fear of our lives and crossed stream to the other side of the land. The walk wasn’t difficult to get to the top, we lost our way, and it was the most terrible unpleasant experience we faced with carrying heavy bags in our shoulders. We had no assurance that there would be a lorry waiting to take us back to the road as the Toyota Hilux what they use had gone to wellawaya town for some other work. So the resort people had to bring a lorry from outside to take us back to the road where our vehicles were parked near the ”Café at the Bend”.. 

MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,  PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. 
Management isn’t paying any attention to the guests or the facilities of the resort. Management doesn’t know the problems of the guests, management doesn’t look after the maintenance..",Couples

Service could have been improved with better organisation.",None
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,2,Great staff but lacking higher management and not worth the money :(,"We stayed here in early September. 

Positives:
- Thoroughly enjoyed the waterfall trek where we could jump into the waterfall and swim. The water was clean and the two ex-navy guides who came with us were very friendly and helpful. When I got stung by 2 wasps they were quick to clean my stings with antiseptic and provide some topical medicine. Obviously have a lot of knowledge about the jungle. 
- Surrounded by beautiful nature, in the evenings you can sit and read a book, while listening and watching the wild peacocks, cows grazing, duck waddling and other animals. 
- All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The young man who served us food was very polite and always trying to do his best. Also, we asked about improving the water pressure in our shower along with getting a fan for our room, and this was provided within the hour we asked. 
- Staff helped us book our bus ticket to Colombo. 
- Organised a bonfire for us in the evening which was very nice.

Negatives:
- The room. While the room initially looks aesthetic and in pictures looks beautiful, the actual practicality of the room is lacking. The top half of the room was totally open and you couldn't lock the glass doors on the balcony. Unfortunately this led to an extremely poor night sleep. We appreciate we are in the jungle, however the fear of monkeys, bats or anything else being able to enter our room easily was disconcerting especially with all the noises you can hear in the night. In addition, theres very little security in the resort so while it might be dramatic to say, with lack of service on the mobile, it can be a bit worrying to be sleeping with a glass door open to anyone who could enter. 
- Food was average - it was nice and personally I liked the vegetarian aspect as I eat a plant based diet. However, my partner did get a bad stomach after breakfast. 
- Not sure what bug, but woke up with many bites on my body, not mosquito but some kind of midge. So would be nice to have a mosquito plug. 
- No receptionist on arrival, she was only there on check-out which we felt was slightly unprofessional. 
- Also we asked if we needed to bring water bottles to which they told us they would provide water bottles. However, on check out we were charged around Rs. 1400 including tax for the water bottles we consumed. We literally would have brought our own had we known this.  
- Curtains had many holes in maybe from moths or rats. 

Overall, the staff really carried our stay and without them we would have left before the night. Higher management of the actual property needs to be dealt with, i.e. renovating the rooms. In addition, not worth the money you pay. It was the same price for us to stay here as cinnamon lodge hotel in habarana which is a 5 star hotel (with facilities such as buffet, swimming pool, in room dining, bicycles etc), and this resort does not live up to that standard.",None

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,Magical experience,"Let me start with the one negative - the drive down to this place is not easy! You have to take an off road vehicle and it’s about 4km of windey, bumpy travel. We were seriously questioning our choice in hotel … then we got to the bottom and had to take a gondola across the forest/river and all our doubts vanished! As we got down from the gondola we were greeted by the amazing view of a rice field, with peacocks wandering around. Behind the rice field was towering trees. Our rooms were next to a bumbling stream, beautiful and so picturesque picturesque. The food we ate was all grown in the 280 acres. It’s 100% self sustainable. They grow all their rice and vegetables. They are 100% organic and make their own worm compost. As an avid Gardner I was fascinated and delighted to walk around the fields and observe all the fruit and vegetables.

There is no Wi-Fi in the cabins, it was the perfect opportunity to just relax and unwind. We had dinner under the stars with a roaring bonfire. This place has so much to offer. The staff was very attentive and kind. If you are a bird watcher, lots of birds to see. We saw a huge flock of the native Hornbill!",None

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,4,Plan on spending more time at the venue,"Ella Jungle Resort is such a unique place that you would not be disappointed if you want to go in an adventure. It is located some what far away from the Ella town. Once you go in there, it takes time to come and go out. So before you go there, plan your trips to other places in Ella accordingly.  Plan on spending more time at the venue once you go there, since there are many places to watch. It will give you a great reboot to you system.",None
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,An unforgettable adventure time in the Ella wild,"We led on a journey with an adventurous off-road drive into the Ella jungle and a rare cable car experience in Sri Lanka. The hotel and rooms are located in riverside and jungle environments. 

The food and beverages are organic, and most of them are vegetarian. Organic meals are delicious and ideal. They maintain large organic cultivation and a poultry farm to fulfill their vegetables etc supplies. There is an indigenous herbs cultivation that is done with the hope of renovating Ayurvedic medication. As they mentioned they wish to start an Ayurvedic medication center as their next project.

It was observed that some services were unable to be fulfilled because of side effects of Covid19 and the prevailing economic crisis, but we give a big tribute to staff continuing the resort at that level.

We had a great set of experiences that could not be taken from any other place.

Highly recommend it for nature lovers, adventurers, and calm seekers. I hope the resort will reestablish to a level which it was before COVID19.",Family
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,3,Adventure,"You should park your car in the parking which belongs to their restaurant ( CAFE ON THE BEND)at Wellawaya Ella main road. They will pick up by 4×4 wheel to the cable car place. We enjoyed cable car travelling to the resort. Nice to see the surroundings of the resort over the river. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean. We enjoyed the river from the river view chalet. The bed was comfortable. Hot water is available.No soap but after request they provide it. No tea making facility in the room but if you want they will give tea as room service.

Amazing place, so much to do and see on this resort - including waterfalls to swim in, walk around the crops and meet the farmers, yoga, sit round the firepit, and more. The road is incredibly bumpy down and then there is a cable car to the resort - all very exciting and very out of the way from anything (thus making it tricky to leave easily or when you want). I spent one of my afternoons swimming in the waterfall with the Chef and then walking round the crops with him picking fresh fruit and veg to try and discuss what to have for dinner. Big shout out to the chef, Wassan, who made this experience for me. Super lovely and super funny, and his food is outstanding.

Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,5,What a combination of  beautiful Jungle setting and true Sri Lankan hospitality,"What a beautiful setting in a deep jungle. It is  only a short ride of 4x4 and cable car away from the road and yet you are world away. The chalet we stayed was amazing. It was huge and very tasteful like a decor in a movie. Our huge balcony/deck  sat  over the steam which you sleep with its soothing sound.  We were looking right at the jungle. Actually we were in jungle. All day we watched monkeys, birds, eagles and all sorts of wild life by sitting on our deck. 

But what is more important than its magnificent setting was their staff. We have never come across such unspoiled, friendly group of people before. Despite it is a professional establishment they treated us as if we were their family. We literally exchanged hugs and numbers when leaving. The food was  local organic vegetarian and amazing. The  ingredients  picked from Ella Jungle Resort’s own  farms. The Chef Wasante  who was also our favorite guy was  not only an amazing chef but also an amazing PR guy who made our stay memorable. Our guide Abi was very knowledgeable and sweet. He gave us free jungle tours to amazing waterfalls nearby. Manager Rowan was very helpful and friendly.  Literally we have experienced true Sri Lankan hospitality there, which is priceless.

Overall,  everyone should go there not for an amazing  jungle but also  for true Sri Lankan human experience.  We will definitely go back there  at least to see our dear  friends in the jungle.",Family
Karandagolla,Ella Jungle Resort,3,Read this before you visit  Ella Jungle resort.,"This was my second visit to Ella Jungle resort and I was disappointed to find that the standard of the property has deteriorated.

COVID Guidelines
We were really surprised to find that the property did not follow proper COVID safety guidelines. There were no temperature checks done, there was no hand sanitizer offered, and no social distancing maintained at the buffet. Food was served buffet-style with unmasked guests serving from the same spoons/cutlery - this made us really uncomfortable, as on one of the days the resort was operating at full capacity. The safety of guests must be prioritised in such situations. 

Food

While the food wasn't terrible, it does not deserve special mention. The choices of food served were always very random. On one night we were served macaroni and cheese, accompanied with a potato curry coleslaw. The combinations of the side dishes and mains could use some thought. 

Service
The service at the property was fine. Although we did notice that they were severely understaffed. Suresh, the manager, was compliant with all our requests. Our waiter, Kumara, was also polite and friendly. 

Environmental Impact
We were surprised to find that the property offered plastic water bottles in each room, which did not fit with their ethos of being 'eco-friendly'. This is something the upper management should seriously consider: either switch to glass bottles or offer filtered water for guests. It is simply not acceptable to consume so many single-use plastic bottles.

Maintenance
The wooden walkway to our cottage had loose boards and sections missing. This could potentially be a hazard, especially for small children. On our first night, there was also no running water in our bathroom. The property did offer to change our rooms, but we chose not to considering it was nearly 10pm in the night. We were informed that this issue had happened before, which makes us wonder why it was overlooked the first time?

Overall, we feel this property has great potential. The location is beautiful, the surrounding river and waterfalls are stunning. Although there were no proper designated trails or paths, there is also potential to promote this as a destination for birdwatchers. We sighted the rare and endemic Racket-tail drongo and other unique species like the Indian Pitta and Tickell's Blue Flycatcher.

We sincerely hope the upper management does look into these factors. In my opinion, at the current price, the experience at Ella Jungle Resort is simply not worth it.",None

Pottuvil,Jetwing Surf,5,Appreciate the staff and location with sharing my experience for nature lovers.,"In year 2021, I found such a beautiful location in Pothuvil through a Web promotion. Unfortunately we missed that destination due to the pandemic situation in that era. Just three weeks before in this year, we visited this place and it is ""Jetwing Surf"". 
  We managed to reach this dream location, around 11.00 am. and the place was full house during our arrival, due to the long weekend. But the hotel staff used the full of their effort to arrange cottages asap for both of our families. Just after the lunch we could receive the cottages. In-house environment of this cottage is really unique and unbelievably wonderful. It's very spacious, luxurious but mostly completed with the nature friendly materials, without neglecting to manage the high cleanliness. Very specially I've never experienced to spend under an ""Iluk"" (some grass) roof in a luxurious place like this.
  Calmness with the only sound of the waves, made an unbelievable peaceful environment for us. Beach, which long for four-five miles, in front of the cottages are so spectacular. I short of my vocabulary to describe the scenery made by  the silent sea, which reflected the beams of full moon at the night. It's continued till midnight, even after finished our dinner, which we took under the roof of ""sky"", with fully decorated by thousands of “blinking stars”.
  All meals made with great deliciousness. Somehow what I feel is, if  the hotels of ""Jetwing chain"" promote to show the talents of their culinary staff, with including the “buffets” for in-house guests, it will be more helpful to increase the demand, when tourists search the locations for enjoying.
  Staff of this hotel (from the gate to the kitchen specially including front desk) was so friendly, polite and well trained incomparably. Specially like to remind Jehan and Kavushalya of front office, who served us so supportively under the guidance of their head - Mr. Hafi. Helpfulness and friendliness of Mr. Hafi which overcame his professional boundaries, just like a family friend, will be unforgettable.
Again thanks a lot for you and your staff Mr. Hafi, for the precious time which we

Mr. Indika was a suberb butler, thoughtful and efficient, always ready to help.

A lovely setting, with outdoor seating by the sea.

Hospitality and staff service was splendid as they were very flexible with our arrangements. One staff member 'Danush' was expectational in providing services, being very friendly and helpful in a professional way. We loved the food at Jetwing Surf, where there was a Ala-carte menu, they even provided a customized breakfast for our toddler. The seafood was really fresh and very creative dishes.

Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,A gem in the old town of Galle,"Fabulous hotel with fabulous service!  We spent two nights here on our tour of Sri Lanka and had a wonderful time. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a loft room which seemed good, however the bed was upstairs and the toilet was down rather steep stairs which we had concerns about. Prochane the duty manager fully understood this and arranged a different upgrade for us so that we were on one level. We would have been happy with a lower grade room but he went out of his way to honour the upgrade.  Could not fault this. Everything about this hotel was first class from the service, pool, breakfast etc.  It is a delightful oasis in an ideal location in the quirky and charming town of Galle. The only small downside for us was that the evening menu was a bit limited for us and we felt it could have had a few more classic dishes on it.  
We had a brilliant young waiter serving us most of the time, he was cheerful, smiled and had a great sense of humour. Sadly I can't find his his name and he was such a great ambassador for the Galle fort.
Highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay again.",Couples

Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,4,Amazing boutique hotel,"We stayed for one night in the admiral suite. The hotel is amazing, staff very professional and courteous. The hotel has 11 rooms only, so all staff are hands on making sure you are comfortable and well looked after.  My favorite part is the courtyard pool which we had it all for ourselves. The food and drinks menus have a good diversity and everything we tried was tasty and thoughtfully prepared. 

The only minus which we had informed the staff about was the bed which was extremely squeaky, that it woke us up several times once one of us would turn sides. Hopefully staff have fixed this issue before next guests come in. Otherwise an amazing hotel and 5 star hospitality.",Family
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,Beautiful historical hotel. Incredible,"A beautiful historic hotel in the centre of galle fort. We had an incredible stay at this hotel and cannot fault anything about our experience. We stayed in the garden suite and have no words to describe! 
We used the pool many times it was great to cool off in especially after a day of sightseeing, it was great and the hotel provided towels so using it numerous times a day was not a problem it is placed in the pretty gardens in the centre of the hotel grounds with immediate access from our amazing suite. There  are sun loungers around the pool should you wish to relax but there was so much to see and do in the area we didn’t have time ! The staff kept all areas clean and were so pleasant and helpful everyone was exceptionally kind. The breakfast was so good with lots of choices.
We cannot recommend this hotel enough and would definitely stay again when visiting Sri Lanka. We particularly liked to sit on the outside area and people watch while enjoying a leisurely drink at the end of the day.
Thank you so much",Couples
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,A return visit,This was our second visit to this hotel the first being in 2019.  It did not disappoint.  The comfort and service were just as we remembered and the location within the Galle Fort is perfect.  The food was excellent and was the bar with its endless  varieties of Ceylon Arrack.  whilst the bar attracted non residents it is a pity more did not stop to enjoy the food.  The staff were very fair.  When we decided to both order rice and curry for dinner the waiter suggested there would be far to much food and that we order just one and maybe a starter to share.  He was right!,Couples
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,1,Disappointing room and management experience,"My wife and I came here hoping to have a relaxed getaway. We wanted to enjoy the Galle area and had read the wonderful online reviews.
We stayed in ""The Grand Apartment""at Galle Fort Hotel. What they don't tell you anywhere in The advertising and booking is the fact that the room is connected to another room and everything that's going on in the next room is very very audible...
The bathroom has no ventilation. It is suffocating to use the bathroom.
At night, the lights from outside light up the interior of the room and it's impossible to sleep in a dark room (picture attached)
We had booked the room for 4 nights but we decided to check out within the first day.
The management refused to even partially refund the amount and retained the entire amount for the 4 nights. Absolute theft.
I would be understanding if they retained the amount for 1-2 nights but for all 4 nights??
Extremely unreasonable management and theft in the name of heritage.",Couples
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,Beautiful hotel.  An oasis in the fascinating Galle Fort.  Brilliant staff.  Would love to return.,"Spent three nights in the grand apartment suite on a b&b basis but had dinner at the hotel every night.  All food was amazing.  Head waiter was very sweet and helpful explaining the menus but was a bit too attentive, asking if everything was ok 4-5 times every meal which ended up being a bit intrusive when we were trying to relax and enjoy our food.  Trust the chef.  Have faith in the kitchen.  In the unlikely event that there had been any problem with the food we would ask.  We were greeted by the manager when we arrived and check in was a really chilled experience with cooling drinks and a tour of the hotel and our suite.  Would definitely recommend the Galle Fort Hotel and hope to return",Couples
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,"Lovely, tranquil historic hotel","Stayed at this gorgeous hotel for a night at the end of our tour round Sri Lanka. 

Our loft room was beautiful, very creaky stairs to the bedroom but part of the charm of this historic building. The pool was so pretty and tranquil, and a lovely treat after walking around Galle in the sun. We had a fantastic evening meal in the restaurant, probably the best of our whole trip, and the individual breakfast was just as good. Lovely cocktails overlooking the street too. 

Friendly helpful team, especially Oshadie in reception - the tin of tea to take home was a nice touch as was the birthday cake when we arrived!",Couples
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,2,Overpriced and definitely NOT a luxury hotel,"The hotel is marketed as a historic luxury hotel. We had booked a suite for about 600 USD per night for 2 nights. At first glance, the hotel has a lot of charm and is also well located. Would we recommend the hotel? No way, never!  This for the following reasons …
Rooms are extremely poorly insulated, you can hear every word and every step of your neighbors. For us, both nights were over by 05:30. The room ( a 600 USD Suite!) was neglected (e.g. large holes in the carpet, torn curtains 
 etc.)
The breakfast service was always chaotic, the menu cards dirty and worn.
 Stay away from this hotel, the hotel next door Galle Fort Bazaar seems to be a much better option in every way.",Friends
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,5,Birthday surprise this great hotel!,"We enjoyed 3 nights at this lovely hotel. It’s in a great location and the small pool was great for a cooling swim after a day in the heat.

At 2.00 we were told they were still not ready so decided to have lunch. We ordered three bowls of soup and one salad. It was 45 minutes before the food arrived. During that time no member of staff apologized or even looked vaguely concerned. Our room was a loft suite with the bed and wardrobe upstairs. The luggage was left downstairs!
The following morning we waited thirty minutes for two bowls of granola and yoghurt. The service in this hotel is not poor, it is non existent  and nobody seems to care",Friends

Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,5,"Trinco woo, woo","Trinco Blu was the better of the three Cinnamon hotels we visited on our tour. principally because the front of house welcome was done properly, unlike elsewhere. The staff were friendly and attentive almost without fault, although the bar staff in particular seemed to be struggling to cope with a lack of manpower, so service was apt to be a bit 'manana'. Our first floor, beachfront room was great, with wonderful views, particularly of the fishermen one morning. Towel service was very good. Restaurant buffet food was excellent, with an extensive menu, surely enough to suit all tastes. 
The beach bar was underused, so for us, ideally quiet and calm. The beach itself was clean, sandy and very long.
If you have the time and inclination, the boat ride to snorkel at Pigeon Island is perhaps worth a go. The ride is about 25 mins each way in total and a bit hard and bumpy. The snorkel area itself is fairly limited and the reef badly bleached, but we snorkeled with a trio of 2m blacktip reefs sharks and spent a few minutes tracking a turtle, which was quite something given the state of the reef. There are the usual reef fish too but not in the quantities you'd see in the Maldives, but the sharks were the big bonus.",Couples

Our room was very comfortable and clean, and we especially loved the sea view – waking up to that every morning was a treat. The pool area was also a highlight; it was clean, relaxing, and perfect for both kids and adults.

Trincomalee,Trinco Blu By Cinnamon,3,Let down by the detail…,"Could be so much better… on the surface it is a great resort- lovely location with a great setting. Unfortunately the details let it down- especially for how much this place costs. 

Had a week here as a family (currently in day 6) as part of a travel across northern Sri Lanka. The third stop of our trip and definitely the worst food and service so far- coolly the very frustrating beach side bar. 

The food in The Crab beach bar is terrible, kept giving it a chance and each time it let us down- completely stale bread for sandwich on first visit. Ordered a Thai crab salad on second visit and they forgot to put dressing. Kids food just reheated frozen food. Service is painfully slow, often the staff just ignore you- I just went for a coffee and the team member blatantly ignored me for 10 minutes so I just gave up. 

Breakfast buffet OK but lots of flies and inconsistent service. 

Some detail around the resort needs work- the beach gets a lot of roundish washed up each morning and it takes hours for it to be cleared up. Our aircon was leaking on the first night quite badly (like a waterfall!), they came to fix but it was still leaking for the next two days with pools of water everywhere- eventually maintenance came and fixed. 

Positives- nice greeting with fresh cold juice and wet towell. Very friendly and helpful pool towel service, great views, lots of sunbeds by pool and beach, housekeeping good and efficient.  Nice to see the fishermen in the morning on the beach bringing in their catch. 

Would I stay again, probably not but tbh there isn’t much choice in the area.",Family

Everyone was very helpful and humble who always gave respect when we used their services. The people at reception were always kind,  the waiters at the restaurant too and the security were always there to help, There was one day where we had many people over for dinner and the waiters made the table really well and extended their closing hours so we could enjoy our night. 

The only thing I’d change about the hotel is to add some privacy in the bedroom’s bathrooms as there are gaps in between the doors in the toilet, which doesn’t make people feel comfortable to use. Furthermore, if the windows could be covered more to block people from seeing from the bedroom and a proper door instead of the door with gaps would be beneficial too.",Family

Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,5,A GOOD CHOICE,"Great location right on the beach. Small friendly hotel. Staff were helpful and service was good. We had a garden bungalow on left hand side which was quiet. I imagine the first bungalow on right hand side may be affected by air con on adjoining hotel. Our room was large and well equipped with a comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom area was a bit tired looking.
We had B&B. Breakfast was buffet and had a good selection. We had lunchtime snacks and a few evening meals all excellent over looking the beach.
The beach is very popular with surfers and loads of offers to hire boards and have lessons.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,4,Delightful small hotel,"In my view this was the nicest hotel in Weligama, situated in a perfect location fronting the beach.  It was a lovely oasis and has by far the nicest position on Weligama Bay.

We had a characterful bedroom - small but functional room with a balcony looking down over the gardens to the sea beyond.  The room did need a little updating with some of the furniture needing varnishing.  The balcony was a good size with two comfortable chairs.

The large swimming pool was delightful right by the beach.  There were sunbeds available both by the pool and on the beach and towels were provided.

What made our stay however was the Cutty Sark Restaurant where we enjoyed 4 dinners.  Quite simply we didn´t want to eat anywhere else because of the lovely atmosphere here.  On one of the nights we had the special set 5 course dinner with a table romantically set up, not quite on the beach but as good as. Their homemade coconut ice cream was lovely. The atmosphere was so romantic watching the waves on the beach. There are also chairs overlooking the beach to have pre-dinner drinks and watch the sunset. The cocktails we had were excellent. Breakfast was also very good in the same restaurant.

The other factor that made our stay were the staff, who were delightful.  Nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and relaxing.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,4,"Beach front, lovely pool, great massage","Enjoyed our stay in Weligama Bay. It was a quiet and peaceful slice of the beach. 

The pool was clean and had a little jacuzzi which was cute. The gardens run directly onto the beach and the bar/restaurant overlooked the beach and sea as well.

Rooms were comfortable and clean, housekeeping made adorable towel animals which were a lovely touch. 

The massage therapist was excellent here, would definitely recommend. 

The food was a bit mixed, some dishes were excellent-homemade coconut ice cream and spring roll starters. The menu was varied, but some dishes were too oily, which was a shame with such good ingredients. Breakfast was a good buffet, with fresh eggs cooked to order.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,4,Surfers paradise,"The location was lovely right on the beach , great for surfing and beautiful safe beach. 
Pool is great, and the cutty sark cafe serves breakfast and food all day long, with fabulous staff and a very good choice menu. 
The hotel building with the reception and main bedrooms is functional , but not appealing to sit in and therefore unless you are at the beach or pool , you end up in your room. The bedroom was clean,  fairly basic and the sea view we were promised wasn’t really one. 
I would still recommend this hotel for a stay at weligama near Galle.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,5,Paradise on the Indian Ocean in Weligama.,"The Weligama Bay resort is out of this world and the photographs on the web don't do justice to the place. Its by far the nicest place on Weligama Bay, because it is right on the beach, you can sit on the patio of the restaurant and watch children play on the beach and hear the calming sound of the Indian Ocean The garden villas are magnificent for families,  a hop step and a jump from the pool and beach. The rooms in the main building are also very spacious and very clean and the service is superb. the rooms unlike what you might get in a sterile 5 star hotel have a Sri Lankan ambience and the resort is small. The Restaurant Cutty Sark, has superb staff who will cook you whatever Sri Lankan dish you want. We had five amazing dinners, party of 15 on the verandah overlooking the pool and the ocean. We surfed and the children had the best time of their lives! We will come back again and again. Indira Samarasekera",Family

If you want to simply feel relaxed, have great views of the ocean and have everything very close to you then take this option. 
The Spa is fairly priced.  The pool is well maintained and deeper than many of the other shallow pools in other hotels. 
You enjoy breakfast just metres from the Ocean and can see the surfers in front of you.  Perfect for a surfing holiday. 
It would perhaps be nice if they have a happy hour with some music playing to spark it the evenings a little. Otherwise perfect.

Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,4,Great beach area,"Gave a review of Very Good but that was because of the location. At check in our guide spoke to the receptionist as I had asked if our room was a sea view, and told only partial. So asked if we could upgrade but that was a no, and felt that the young lady was a bit unfriendly. Our guide spoke for us and we were offered another room and I could go see both and choose, which I thought was kind but I am sure it was our guide whom the receptionist was trying to please? We chose the second room S04 which had a better sea view than S09? Room was clean enough. The dining room is down at the beach and just loved having breakfast there albeit there was not a lot of choice but they did make my husband porridge oats every morning which he loved. We chose this hotel rather than the Marriot next door as wanted more of a Sri Lankan experience rather than be in a modern sky scraper building. Dining staff very friendly, more friendly than Miss Snotty at reception! I loved the beach area which was very clean and tidy, though walking along the beach to the right and left you found that the beach there was not clean and filled with rubbish, really shocking, and so glad that we were at the most cleanest part of this beautiful surfers paradise. We just loved sitting on the chairs on the raised stoned area looking out to the sea and watching all the new surfers being trained. Our Half Board menu was ok and enjoyed what we had chosen but the coconut ice cream is to die for, absolutely amazing! Our flights back were late at night and asked Miss Snotty if we could have a late check out, but it would  cost us $117 for 5 hours, I asked if they could do better and since we were half board would they give us some kind of meal or snack before leaving. A definite no but brought the price down to $100. So we agreed on the price but asked if fresh towels and bottles of water could be provided and yes to towels but no to water?  I said to them that we felt that was very mean not to give us the water and they relented. We felt that the receptionist was unhelpful (only doing the minimum)  and bit unfriendly when we were asking on tuc tucs to Mirissa and also a driver to take us to Galle. The hotel driver was so very friendly on our trip to Galle which we thoroughly enjoyed as was the tuc tuc driver to Mirissa. Lovely lovely people. The location of the hotel, The clean beach and pool area and attendants,  the friendliness from the dining staff and where the dining room was were for us the best parts of our stay there. The reception staff not as helpful and friendly.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,5,Peaceful family beach holiday,"Loved the garden villas. Such a quiet place next to the busy happening marriot and kurumba. Kids loved the space, the pool and the surf lessons right on the beach. Totally recommend savi's surf lessons right next to this place. Kurumba is a great place to get meals. On BB the hotel itself is quite pricey given its off season but the staff are friendly. No buffet but decent breakfast set menus.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,5,Perfect and beautiful hotel and nature!,"It was my amazing vacation in that hotel along with my 11 year old son for 14 days in Sept 2024. 

The location, beach, ocean, food (BB), nature, and room are perfect for me. 

The staff is very friendly, prudential, and responsible.

Spa and Wellness center with the master Mona of many kinds of massage (I personally experienced there the  Balinese body massage, hands massage, and the head and face massage) was absolutely enjoyable and gifted for my body and soul!

We used to visit Captain Seafood Restaurant on Passikudah road for lunch and dinner. The owner of the restaurant Roshan is very friendly, hospitable, and professional. We didn't want to go for seafood and fresh juices and mix fruit cocktails but to the Roshan's restaurant. He also provided us with 2 interesting, impressive, comfortable, and well-organized excursions to Pigeon Island, Conesh Waram Hindu Temple, Deers Park (Trincomalee tour), and the Ramboda trip (Damro tea plantation, Ramboda beautiful waterfalls, and Spice Garden).

The only discomfort we felt in the hotel were dogs who barked and had quarrels near our doors and windows daily and nightly distracting us from the rest and sleeping.

Kalkudah,Anantaya Resort & Spa,4,"A good hotel, although with disappointing food and beverages.","An overall positive experience, although with some disappointments. The rooms are well-kept and spacious, with very large, comfortable beds. The villas especially are very large, housing a family of 4 with great comfort. The hotel is very close to the ocean, and the beach set up is comfortable. However, the food and drinks left much to be desired. There is only one restaurant, which predominately works buffet-style (there is an a la carte option, but the choices are practically identical to the buffet) and the food it offers was not of high quality neither in terms of taste, presentation nor freshness. The freshness of desserts was especially questionable, and the quality of the fresh juices was disappointing, as they were heavily watered down. Fortunately for us, there is a string of small local restaurants nearby, where the dinner options are much better. Overall, if one is not fussy about food, or does not mind dining out, we would still recommend, although it is well to keep the above in mind.",Family

Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,2,"Lovely Ambiance at Restaurant but if its Sri Lankan flavours that you’re looking for, then this is not the place","My review is not about the hotel, but its restaurant

Its located in the hotel and overlooks the room blocks and the swimming pool. At dinner, the ambiance was beautiful and relaxing. 

The menu for dinner had a selection of starters. The main courses were divided into a section suggesting that dishes were from specific parts of Sri Lanka and another section with straightforward mains. The starters were good. We ordered 3 different mains to be shared. The portions were only good for one person and not enough to be shared. We should have been better advised by the waiter. 

And the main courses were bland. Despite being advised by the waiter that they would be spicy. Sri Lankan food is great. But the ones produced here are bland and a very poor representation of Sri Lankan flavours. Perhaps they have been watered down to suit the Western palates. If so, let the patrons know so that we can request for Sri Lankan authentic flavours

I would not recommend this restaurant for its food.",Family
Galle,Galle Fort Hotel,1,Families and kids not welcome!,"We were looking forward to staying in Galle Port hôtel. 
We are guilty of having 3 kids so we called them directly to book 2 rooms, asking for a baby cot as well.
We were told no rooms could accommodate us and no additional beds could be put except in the library suite (68sqm) but not on the other suites (some bigger).
After rechecking the hotel site and wasting an hour trying to understand we called the hotel again.

At the end we were just clearly told that it is the hotel policy not to accommodate families and kids.

Very disappointing.
At least they should be honest and indicate the hotel as adults only on their website.
But I guess that in off season they are happy to take the money from families....

There are many other nice hotels around, so if you are a family...go somewhere else !",Family

Mouthwatering food.  beach is very clean and all stakeholders including all other hotels and surf schools  are taking care of it.  One can surf  either side of the hotel beaches. Very safe and well maintained swimming pool add more glamor. Anyhow prices are very unreasonable. A water bottle cost me Rs 650 and the same brand of it , within 100 meters from hotel was only Rs 120.  For our first lunch cost us Rs 33,000+ as they refused to add that to FB saying it starts from Dinner!! but since we had one dinner out side and skipped the lunch the day we departed, altered bill from full board to HF , reduction  was only 4000+/day.  This is absurd and we have never experience such in any other place. Such pricing may get them quick returns but ruined their reputation much quicker.

The resort itself was very beautiful with long palm trees that makes you feel like you are in paradise, a swimming pool with Jacuzzi, spa, and restaurant. 

The resort is also connected to Welligama beach which is ideal if you want to have some drinks with some breeze looking at surfers or book some surfing lessons (well worth it!). There are also a number of food courts nearby if you want to try local cuisine. It is also nice to go for a walk and talk with some locals.

Most importantly, the entire staff make you feel very welcome. Not only do they provide good service (what you expect from a resort), but they are also observant and friendly. For example, I was interested in discovering some Sri Lankan music and they played a diverse list of songs. 

Even though we went as a family, I think this resort is well worth it for couples, friends or solo travellers because of the friendly staff and the beautiful location.",Family

Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,3,Beautiful location friendly staff. Sadly a lot of maintenance issues.,"Just spent 4 nights at this hotel.
Positives absolutely kind friendly staff the grounds are beautifully maintained and it’s right on the beach.
We paid for a premium room which was a front villa with amazing views.  
The room staff did an amazing job with towel art and kept the room spotless.  
The restaurant table service was excellent with lovely tables and comfortable chairs.
We ate out most nights for a variety.  The chef was kind enough to cook some SriLankan food as an alternative to set breakfast.  He was really accommodating and friendly.

The room wasn’t ready upon arrival as the air conditioning wasn’t working.  They had about 4 maintenance crew having a look at it.   Eventually they got it going.  It’s an old rusted out Toshiba Air con but certainly cooled the room very quick.   The room was lovely and well fitted out.  The bath room is dated but certainly did the job.

Sadly Air Conditioner broke down again which couldn’t be fixed.  The only ignoring part is they knew it was broken before we arrived as a part had burnt out causing it to trip power on the compressor.

We were moved to a different room which was slightly smaller and had a cheap Chinese air conditioner which was undersized for the room. It didn’t really chill the room much.  This villa type on Agoda was about $30 cheaper a night.  The bath room on this villa had a rotted out shower frame with various mould types from black, pink and a kind of brown colour.  Green moss was also growing on frame.  It was so rotted that caused the bathroom to flood when you had a shower.   It is a slip hazard we just used towels where the holes were.
I figured if you didn’t touch the mould you would be ok.   Not sure how children would go but they did have an option of a bath.

Only  5 rooms were booked in the whole place as it was there off season.  Hopefully repairs will occur.  The Marriott is next door for the same price if you like high rise accomodation or W15 which is also a couple of doors down and much newer.

I really loved the location of the hotel.  The surf instructor was fantastic.  
In fact all the staff are a credit to this hotel.  They just need to spend some money on maintenance.  Our shower hose was split which I didn’t really care about but certainly other guests would this is a very easy fix.",Couples

Lovely clean rooms wonderful decor comfy bed. Did not try the spa so cannot comment. Food prices were same in the area but big portions so could get away with sharing a main and 2 starters.

The chef and restaurant manager were exceptional and so lovely. They greeted us every day and made us off menu food as well. Every meal we had was delicious and pretty reasonably priced for the area. 

One day we mentioned we were going whale watching the next morning and the chef went out of his way to make us a packed breakfast to our liking and left with security for us to take with us at 5am. 

One day when I fancied a Sri Lankan breakfast they made me my own beautiful meal with so much food. I can’t stress how much they made our stay amazing.

The 'hotel' made every attempt to remain environmentally sustainable. The recognition of Christmas-eve with a specially-curated dinner, little gifts from Santa for the kids and trinkets for all, carols from a local church with a Santa in attendance made the stay truly memorable and magical for my family! Manager of the Hotel, Mr. Hafi, and the receptionist Mr. Jehan were the epitome of hospitality, Mr. Jehan expressing concern about our safety after being informed that our car had met with an accident on the way. In line with their environmental sustainability policy, the hotel does not try 'own' the beach and landscape its surroundings too much. Its seeming isolation and 'wild', one-with-the environment appearance was something we appreciated. I've already recommended the hotel to members of the extended family although it's a long distance to travel from Kandy!

We also appreciated the Tsunami commemoration by the Hotel. We joined them but were saddened to notice that the other Sri Lankan families/visitors there did not think to join the commemoration for the 5-10 minutes it took!

Jetwing Surf is a beautiful hotel located in a serene coastal area, offering exceptional views and a peaceful retreat. We visited to celebrate our kid's birthday, and from the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff. The room(Cabana) was nicely cleaned and well-maintained, and it met all the promises made during the booking process.

The surrounding views are simply breathtaking, with a clean, quiet beach right at the doorstep, perfect for relaxing or enjoying the natural beauty. The dining area, though limited in size, was sufficiently serviced to meet all our needs. The alà carte menu provided a limited variety of delicious options, but the staff ensured that all our dining preferences were taken care of.

The hotel also boasts a nicely maintained pool, with a well-prepared lifeguard present at all times. I was especially impressed with the additional care provided for kids. I experienced their attentiveness firsthand during a little incident with my young ones, and they ensured everything was handled with great care and caution.

A special thank you goes to Dulanjana, whose dedication and exceptional service made our stay even more memorable.

Pottuvil,Jetwing Surf,5,Perfect Getaway in Eastern Coast of Sri Lanka,"We loved everything about the resort. The cabanas had all modern equipment while still having the thatched roofs and  palmyrah leaf walls in a cabana style.  From straw hats to toothbrushes all amenities are included in these. The dining area is also beautiful right near the pool amidst coconut trees. 
I want to mention Lakshan who served us was very patient with all our requirements in the dining area. He suggested the best dishes, best combos super friendly and always smiled. And it was a superb fine dining experience with the sea breeze. 

My little sister had a small accident and sprained her wrist and the staff ; from Life guards to the management were very helpful to find us a way to get to doctor and they gave first aid onsite.

Pottuvil,Jetwing Surf,5,Amazing experience!,"Our stay at Jetwing Surf Hotel was nothing short of exceptional, from start to finish. We stayed in a spacious sea view cabana that was perfectly equipped for all weather conditions, whether rain (umbrellas) or shine (bug spray). The cabana offered a great balance of luxury and comfort, with more than enough space to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

The service was impeccable throughout our stay. Special mention to Dinesh, who went above and beyond to organize a beautiful birthday meal right on the beach—an experience we’ll never forget. Our butler, Dulanjana, was outstanding. He was professional, attentive, and made sure we had no worries during our stay. His care and attention to detail truly enhanced our experience.

The food at Jetwing Surf was incredible. Every meal was a visual and culinary delight, thanks to the talented chef. The quality and presentation were always of the highest standard. Even during our early morning safari, the hotel ensured that we had a packed breakfast and drinks ready for our 5 AM departure, which was a thoughtful touch.

Our safari at Kumana National Park was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our trip. This was all recommended and arranged by the resort.  We were lucky enough to see leopards, elephants, deer, and so many other animals up close in their natural habitat. The wildlife was abundant, and the best part was how peaceful it felt—at times, it seemed like we had the entire park to ourselves!

The experience was well-organized and truly immersive. The beauty of Kumana lies not just in the animals but also in the quiet, untouched wilderness. It’s a must-do for anyone visiting the area, and we highly recommend it!

We also indulged in in-room massages, which were fantastic—perfect for unwinding. The pool was clean and a great spot to relax during the day.

This resort truly goes above and beyond, treating guests like royalty. We are already recommending it to our friends and family and cannot wait to return ourselves. A huge thank you to the team for making our stay so memorable!",Couples

From a half an hour 4-wheel bumpy ride into the forest to a cable car ride to get to the resort, it was quite an experience. The views around including a flowing stream amidst the greenery were a cooling sight and ideal for relaxation. Not to forget the natural sounds of birds and water flowing! The in house activities included ziplining which was quite daring and waterfall trekking.
The service provided is commendable. The meals were all made from organic produce sourced from their garden.Each time the meal was served in different  places with beautiful  unique scenery around  to admire.
The camp fire was lit to give warmth to the cold breeze when the dinner was served in open air

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,10 days Fortress Hotel Sri Lanka,"We spent 10 days here rounding off our tour of Sri Lanka. This beachside hotel featured an extensive pool area (50 m pool for serious swimmers) and smaller pools for children. The hotel's grounds are quite large, allowing guests to find private spots if desired. The hotel grounds give access to a sandy beach but sea swimming is not the main theme due to surf and currents.
The rooms are spacious and well-equipped with comfortable beds and pillows. We chose the bed and breakfast option but noted there are not many dining options nearby without taking a taxi. A Tuk Tuk ride to Galle, approximately 15 km away, costs about £8 each way, with drivers willing to wait a couple of hours for you in the price.
Breakfast at the hotel offers a wide variety, including pastries, fresh fruit, smoothies, cooked breakfast options, and continental bread basket selections. Many might find a midday meal unnecessary after a substantial breakfast.
The main menu is extensive, featuring Sri Lankan curries, prawn and fish options, as well as chicken, lamb, and vegetarian dishes. There are also burger, chicken  and fish and chips options for those who prefer less spicy food. Most main courses are priced around $15 USD, with starters ranging from $5 to $15 USD. We found a main course sufficient though. however a couple of glasses of wine and beer can double the price of a meal.
The staff were consistently excellent throughout the hotel. While service in the restaurant occasionally suffered when busy, this appeared to be a management or training issue rather than a reflection on the staff, who were always responsive and helpful.
Overall, the country is very welcoming, with friendly locals who value tourism. The accommodation, food quality, and service were all commendable.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Definitely worth booking,"Perfect place to unwind and relax. The staff are so nice, everyone acknowledges you and will help with anything you need. 
The pool area is never too crowded and the view is amazing.
They even have a small turtle nesting area and let the baby turtles out in the sea when they hatch. 
Only constructive feedback I would give the hotel is to up their food quality a bit and perhaps explain their guests about how breakfast works a bit better - we were so confused. Also, I had a message, which was nice - but the price of 18.500 LKR is obscenely expensive for what you actually get (there is not even a consultation before to meet expectations of the message, which I would expect for that much money) 

But overall, I would not hesitate in booking again!!",Couples

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,"Beautiful Hotel with brilliant service, stunning views and peaceful","Wonderful hotel set in old buildings, we loved our 8 night stay there.   
Breakfast was exceptional with endless options and our Ocean view room was beautiful, so spacious with stunning views of the pool, beach and sunsets.

All the staff are wonderful with very good training and always smiling.  Particular thanks to Nuwan the pool guy and we loved seeing the baby turtles which are hatching in an area to the side of the pool, such a great initiative by the hotel.  

The beach by the hotel is lovely for walking, very empty and under developed so you can walk for miles.   Mostly the sea is too rough for swimming but there is a little lagoon by the hotel for a dip at low tide.

We did many trips out from the hotel to Galle for cricket & history tour and Aghangama where there are lovely bars & restaurants. 

Only slight issue is the tuk tuk drivers who run like a mafia opposite the hotel, constantly trying to over charge which gets annoying & tiring every time you go out.   
If you check the Pick Me app which is the Uber for transport in Sri Lanka you can see the true price you should be paying but the Pick Me drivers were not  able to come near the hotel!

Our favourite  places in Ahangama were Kai, Hotel de Uncles & Ceylon Sliders for more modern food & cocktails and watching the surfers at sunset.   1000 LKR each way is generous for the 10 min tuk tuk ride.  It’s a lovely local town.

Best beach for swimming & snorkelling is Wijaya, often turtles there but you need to go early and leave by 10am as it gets far too busy.  Beautiful for an hour first thing.",Couples

We had our Wedding Ceremony at the Fortress and there is simply no words to describe the wonderful experience we had. Every aspect of our wedding ceremony was professionally and meticulously arranged by the staff at the Fortress. From organising the necessary marriage documents to the floral arrangements, wedding bouquets and bower, decorations, cake, celebrant, music, photography, special celebratory dinner, and the list goes on., we couldn’t have been happier with all of these things and the very best service we received at the Fortress. 

A special mention to our wedding coordinator ‘GAYANI’ who went above and beyond to make sure that our wedding ceremony was successful and memorable. Her attention to detail and dedication to make sure we were happy with all the arrangements is something we will always remember and be grateful for.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Stunning hotel,"The Fortress was our final hotel on our Sri Lanka holiday and we could not have chosen a better place to spend our last week, it is simply a stunning resort.
We were in the Fortress rooms which we knew in advance didn’t have a beach view and that didn’t affect us at all. The room was lovely and spacious. There was a proper size fridge, daily water provided and excellent house keeping.
The food at the White restaurant was superb, we would end up having a 3 course breakfast and ate dinner at the hotel every evening. Mr Sam was always around to answer and questions on the menu and the service staff were great.
There are plenty of sun loungers, even when coming back to the hotel in the afternoon and the pool is stunning. Turtles can be seen just off the beach and Laksiri and all the pool guys are really good.
The little tuk tuk stand opposite was handy and the staff on the hotel gate were super helpful by always agreeing the price for us with the drivers in advance.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Perfection,"This was our second visit, the first being 15 years ago when it was new. We were looking for a complete chill out and relaxing break after a very stressful year. We were not disappointed, it was perfect. We stayed in a beach room which gave us direct access to the beautiful gardens and breathtaking ocean. Our room was exceptionally clean, although certain parts were a little bit tired, but we had a first class service from both Namal and Lakmar, who made sure we had everything we needed and it was a delight to see the creative displays on a few occasions on our bed when we returned. We were so surprised to see Laksiri after so many years who was now the supervisor of pool boys, we were so looked after by both Laksiri and Upul, we always had our sun loungers, towels and umbrella prepared. We thoroughly enjoyed our 8 nights, we  booked half board basis for first time, in hindsight I would not do that again as we prefer flexibility and a la carte, the set menu which comes with half board was ok, but for not a lot more the a la carte was far better. Next time we will book just  bed and breakfast.  The hotel is stunning visually and staff were so helpful and accommodating. I also enjoyed having a manicure and pedicure.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Thank you for the wedding of a lifetime.,"Where do I start? Firstly, a massive apology for taking too long to write my 5 star review.

Our secret destination elopement wedding took two years to plan, but it only took a few moments to realise that, after touring Sri Lanka for a week, we wanted to not only relax at the Fortress for 5 days, but also to get married here as well. 

The good reviews are all you need to read. From the moment we arrived everyone knew who we were and we were treated like the king & queen of the hotel for the duration of our stay.

The huge wooden doors greet you and the moment you step through them you just know you’re in a real land of luxury and that your stay here is going to be truly memorable. 

Our Wedding Planner Gayani was there to meet us and give us a grand tour of the hotel. Our room was ready on arrival – a complimentary upgrade to a ground floor plunge pool room (WOW!) which opened up directly on to the amazing garden area with the pool & beach just several meters away. Once we were settled we met up with Gayani once again to plan our wedding day which turned out to be extremely straightforward – mainly because, once we’d chosen flowers, locations, timings, etc. Gayani simply wouldn’t let us lift a finger and she arranged absolutely everything!

After a busy week touring Sri Lanka it was finally time to relax. The pool area is stunning, the gardens are exceptionally well maintained, the beach is glorious (right hand side you can walk for miles, left hand side is a safe swimming area), the whole hotel is spotlessly clean, the bar is relaxing, the comfy sunbeds moved to where ever you’d like them, the service is quick, professional and super-friendly… I could go on and on! Every single member of staff had a smile on their face.

We were all inclusive and to our surprise some evenings in White were buffet and some a la carte, there was also a seafood BBQ buffet. We didn’t see the point of eating at the Salty Snapper but we did eat at Duo on our wedding night which was one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Some reviews said it was a little pricey but as it was our wedding night we decided to treat ourselves.  The restaurant staff were all amazing and the food the best we had in all of our trip, so much variety and everything so tasty. We ate so much at breakfast we didn’t need lunch and in the evenings we still struggled to fit in more food. 

We had planned to go outside of the hotel and explore but we were so comfy, happy and relaxed after our week touring that we decided to just enjoy the hotel, the weather, the turtles swimming just off shore, the lizards and crabs running about, and the bats flying around at night. Oh and there was a massive grass snake on day 1, plus some noisy crows. 

We did have to venture to the local Registry Office to apply for our wedding licence. Again, Gayani arranged all of this for us. Her driver picked us up and Gayani met us there… on her day off.  This was quite an exciting & interesting part of the experience of getting married overseas.

Our wedding day involved a lovely breakfast and a couples massage in the spa. My wife-to-be said it was one of the best massages she’s ever had. I’ll be honest I think the wedding nerves were kicking in and I struggled to relax. My partner was then treated to two hours of hair & make-up whilst I was given a spare room to relax & get ready in. Some of the minibar may have been consumed to calm the nerves. At a very reasonable extra cost we paid for dancers & drummers who collected me at reception and paraded me through the hotel and on to the beach.  It was then my partners turn.  The sun was shining, it was just about bearable in the heat, the whole hotel had a wedding show just for them and everything was simply amazing. Maybe we should have googled Sri Lankan weddings a bit more before the day, but I think the surprise of everything made it 10x betting, especially when two young girls appeared out of nowhere and started singing – we both had to hold back some tears. After the ceremony on the beach we signed the wedding certificates, shared out some cake and popped some champagne. We headed to the bar and then to the Duo restaurant which was the perfect end to an unforgettable day! 

Thank you, especially to Gayani, for the wedding of a lifetime. Not only would I highly recommend staying at the Fortress Resort & Spa but I would highly recommend getting married here as well.",Couples

This is a beautiful hotel and we enjoyed our stay, excellent food & service and enjoyed being in the heart of Galle Fort. However, we stayed in the Admiral Cheng Ho suite and I have to say it has the most uncomfortable, noisy, creaky bed we have ever slept in!  3 nights of terrible sleep, even though I moved to the other bed on the mezzanine floor of the suite.

At a guess, I would say that consisted of eight different dishes all delicately spiced and delicious. I opted for a no alcohol based cocktail which was perfect for me and enabled me to share with others and taste some of the alternatives.

We had breakfast and lunch here before checking out and all of the food was delicious and fresh, I had the prawn curry with bread and it was amazing.

Some of the Staff at Restaurant was not friendly. Was the only hotel on our journey where no guests wearing Face masks during breakfast. We were the only ones. Really Poor Covid Management. The beach and sunbeds were really nice and the 2 lifeguards were really friendly and awesome.",Couples
Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,3,"We had an amazing stay; however, avoid the restaurant!","We had a mixed stay at the Weligama Bay Resort.

The Good
The arrival was smooth and easy - we had a great first impression of the resort and room. The staff were very welcoming and had setup the villa nicely - also with a crib for our daughter. We also had a few bookings in the spa - highly recommend the masseuse and his treatments.

The Bad & Ugly
Unfortunately one can only book a room with breakfast. Furthermore, the Christmas and New Years Eve dinners were mandatory - the prices charged were excessive for the service and food quality offered. There was an issue every time for opening hours (they were never ready for breakfast!), communicating the buffet time for Christmas eve - we entirely missed out on the BBQ as they said that the BBQ and buffet would close at 11pm - yet it closed at 10pm! As soon as the restaurant was at half capacity, the service and food delivery would slow down significantly - we would end up wasting a lot of time waiting to order and then waiting for the food to arrive. Even for simple orders such as a tea - delivery time would be in excess of 30 minutes! The BBQ was overrated - the food was pre-cooked and then they just threw it onto the grill to re-heat it (with the exception of the lobster) - the calamary was as chewy as a shoe-sole / simply not eatable - when I mentioned it to the executive chef (who was busy with everything but overseeing the kitchen and grill operation), he gave an impolite 'this is Sri Lankan calamary' - this response and lack of care makes absolutely no sense! Furthermore, the gala dinner buffet was served in the hot restaurant space (AC clearly did not work), which makes it unsanitary for any raw food items and allow for bacteria to develop - especially on the raw fish items. Even the staff were sweating and struggling in the hot and humid restaurant space - luckily all the seating was outside.
By the end of our trip, we frequently ended up going next door to the Marriott for breakfast, lunch and dinner - the prices were similar, the service was way better and we even got breakfast and a few other meals comped.

Conclusion
You can stay here and have a good time, as long as you pay for room only and do not go to the restaurant - unless you want to waste time, money and eat shoe-soles.",None

Weligama,Weligama Bay Resort,2,Not Recommended,I had very bad experience with the hotel. First of all bathroom of my room was dirty and had many stains. Washbasin was broken. The restaurant inside the resort is good for foreigners and not for Vegetarian Indians. I had to wait for more than 1 hour to get my lunch served that too after repetitive follow up. While other guest who arrived later than us got their meal pretty early. In the morning breakfast they didn’t have any Vegetarian dish to be served. Overall after paying $250/night for the hotel didn’t provide the value of money especially when you get this treatment.,Family

Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Most memorable hotel in sri lanka out of 8,"I would give this hotel higher stars if they were available. Although it wasn't the most luxurious of the 13 days I spent in sri lanka, it compensated in genuine customer svc. The view from the rooms view all the way to the ocean but also show the pool and grounds. I believe I was on 2nd or 3rd floor. I had half board here so I ate dinner here, the options was shellfish for fish. I explained to them I cannot eat, they made a exception and offered tuna and seerfish, a local fish, it was cooked to perfection . I had to have it again the next evening. 

The waiter in the restaurant,  it was his last day there because he was doing his internship there was the most respectful down to earth human I met in the entire trip , I can't remember his name but he will go on to greatness. I'm in restaurant mgmt myself. I gave him some pointers. The fruit plate they offered for dessert is still in my brain 4 months later. 

The staff all across the board were so genuinely friendly and engaging. 

I recommend if you stay in mirissa, stay here. The beach is about an 1/8 of a mile , so you can get a rickshaw.

Dambulla,Occidental Paradise Dambulla,5,"A Veritable Treasure in Dambulla: Natural Beauty, Warm Hospitality, and Treasured Memories","We stayed at Occidental Paradise in Dambulla on the second day of our road trip, and it was nothing short of magical. This resort really lives up to its name: it's a paradise for families, nature lovers, and anyone who needs some peace and quiet in nature.

We were warmly welcomed as soon as we got there. Oh, it was unforgettable: it was traditional, elegant, and felt personal. It was amazing that they put a sash around our necks, which we got to keep as a nice keepsake. I think Team Occidental truly lives up to hospitality. 

The chalets were big and well-kept, and they were comfortable because they were in a beautiful natural setting. We loved waking up to the sound of birds and seeing peacocks walking around the grounds. It was like living in a nature documentary!

The pool area was great because it had separate areas for adults and kids. Our kids had a great time. Another great thing was the in-room dining. It was tasty, easy, and served with care.

There was a lot of food, it was different, and it was all very good. There was food for everyone, from local favorites to kid-friendly choices.

But the hospitality was what really stood out. We've stayed at a lot of places, but this team was the best. The Resident Manager and the General Manager both came to see us in person, which was a rare and nice gesture that made us feel very important. Thanks a lot to Ashan and the rest of the team for going above and beyond.

If you’re ever heading to Dambulla, Occidental Paradise should be on your must-visit list. It's more than just a hotel; it's the best way to experience Sri Lankan hospitality, nature, and warmth.

Special thanks to Ruwan (group accounts manager) for helping me out with the last-minute reservation.

Dambulla,Occidental Paradise Dambulla,4,3 night stopover during the holiday,The layout of this hotel is lovely with individual lodges in lush greenery and a great pool area. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We felt like we were in the middle of the jungle as monkeys were racing around and tropical birds were singing. The staff were very welcoming especially the restaurant staff. The buffet was good. The only aspect was the very  high price of the drinks in comparison with other hotels. Other than that it was a lovely hotel and the staff were so welcoming.,Family

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Fabulous in every respect,"If I could give six stars I probably would.  The Fortress is fabulous.  We had a stunning room, plenty of space, gorgeous view of the pool and sea only just beyond, the sound of the ever present surf is like a gentle song which will send you to sleep with a smile on your face.  The staff are simply sensational and nothing is too much trouble, nothing.  The Chef Anushka Fernando was the ultimate charming professional.  He was patience personified and talked us through every dish, every day and greeted us like long lost friends every time he saw us.  Sam was equally as attentive and always looking to help us maximise our enjoyment of the day.  All the staff were lovely and a special mention to Nawan who made sure we were always looked after by the pool.  The Spa was nice too and all in all this made the perfect end to a simply amazing holiday in Sri Lanka, thank you everyone.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,This is a fabulous hotel with exceptional service.,"This is a fabulous hotel! The staff are amazing, always smiling, always helpful, nothing is too much trouble.

We had a wonderful time and intend to return.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,An exemplary experience near Galle,"This is the third time we have been to this hotel.We simply love the ambiance,the quality of the food and the wonderful service.A special shout out to Sam,who headed up the restaurant team.He looked after us personally and especially when my wife was unwell,he arranged for special broths and simple food until she felt better.
Also the pool/garden attendants,Nuwan and Udul who made sure we were comfortable in the gardens and around the pool.The jacuzzi bath in the Ocean view room was also a treat.Its easy to get into Galle from the hotel by Tuk Tuk as they are stationed opposite.
The long stretch beaches are lovely for walking along but the sea is pretty rough and not really suitable for swimming-however a few surfers were giving it a go!
If you want your own sun beds then suggest you go for the beach ground floor rooms which open out directly onto the gardens and then you can avoid the minor inconvenience of trying to secure your favourite spot by the pool first thing in the morning.
We shall return for another vacation at this lovely establishment in the not too distant future.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Great hospitality and wonderful staff,"Arrived at the Fortress after a tour in Sri Lanka during which my wife injured her ankle.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,A taste of luxury just outside Galle,"This is a truly exceptional hotel which has an exclusive feel but, thanks to the friendliness of the staff, puts you totally at your ease. Our room overlooking the pool had every comfort; the restaurant catered for every taste and the staff were always ready to help. You are a short car ride out of Galle itself, but next to the ocean and a small section of beach. Staying here at the end of our 2-week holiday to Sri Lanka felt like a true taste of luxury and we arrived home rested and relaxed! Thanks to all the staff for your hard work and especially for making Valentine’s Day so special for us all!",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,A beautiful resort near Galle,"After staying in the hill country for a couple, of weeks, we spent the final week of our holiday at the Fortress Resort & Spa on the coast at Koggala.  This is an excellent resort, where the friendly staff provide exceptional service.  Although the hotel advertises that it has three restaurants, most guests had dinner in Whites, the main restaurant, which has an extensive a la carte menu, as well as a daily menu with a smaller number of dishes for those like us who were on half board.  The food was of the highest quality, and as always when we are in Sri Lanka, we mostly ate the local dishes.  Although we have visited the country many times, and enjoyed countless rice and curry dinners, we were delighted to be served some vegetable curries here that we had not previously encountered.  The open sided bar is a good place to have a drink while watching the sun set.  In the day, time can be spent relaxing on a sun lounger, keeping an eye open for the turtles that come at high tide, but there are also many interesting things to do in the vicinity.   Just across the road is an interesting cultural museum dedicated to the work of the writer Martin Wickramasinghe, that includes exhibits related to rural life in Sri Lanka, and a very restful Buddhist temple within walking distance on an island in the nearby Koggala lake. We like using local transport and took the train or bus to both Galle and Weligama, both within half an hour of the hotel.  The excellent service and the beautiful surroundings make this an ideal resort to spend time enjoying Sri Lankan hospitality at its best.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Absolutely fabulous hotel!,"We stayed at the Fortress Resort & Spa in February 2025 and cannot praise it enough! The Hotel is fabulous, all the staff are so friendly and attentive, the room was spotlessly clean (cleaned twice a day including fresh towels and bedding changed daily) and even beautiful flower displays left on our bed by the  superb Sampath who looked after us. The food and service were amazing and all the staff knew exactly who we were from the moment we arrived. We had a beach room which was beautifully decorated and had fabulous views, with our own sunloungers right outside which gave us privacy. The pool was large and never busy and the pool guys made sure we always had an umbrella and towels first thing every morning. We also had a delightful massage at the spa which was a treat! We felt totally pampered throughout our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return. Thankyou for making our last week in Sri Lanka a holiday to remember!",Friends
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Fabulous Honeymoon,"We have not long returned from our fabulous honeymoon staying at The Fortress Resort and Spa. This hotel was recommended to us by the travel Agent who said the photos don’t do it justice. How right she was. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with open arms, everyone was so friendly that it was impossible not to instantly relax. We stayed in one of their Ocean rooms which again was lovely and as u would expect had a brilliant view out over the Indian Ocean. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, from the pool attendants, to the laundry staff, to the receptionists and finally to the restaurant staff. We only stayed here for 5 days and in hindsight which we had stayed longer but we loved every minute of it and will definitely go back at some point. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Relaxing by the sea,"We were dropped off by our driver at the end of 2 wks touring Sri Lanka for a blissful and relaxing beach break before the end of our holiday.  We had a very spacious first floor room with sea view and balcony, huge bathroom with double basin, bath, shower and wc.  WiFi.  TV.  Perfect.  Every single member of staff that we met was credit to the hotel - from the pool staff, housekeeping, dining room and reception….everyone.  
We enjoyed amazing breakfasts on the B&B package and then chose dinner as we wished. We went out one evening for dinner in Galle. Hope to return one day to enjoy the fabulous pool, walks along the huge beach, swimming in the sea pool, fresh fruit juice on the sunloungers, delicious food and the Sri Lankan hospitality.",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Fabulous hotel and brilliant staff,"We stayed at the Fortress for a week after a week exploring Sri Lanka and what a bit of paradise it was. Our room was a beach room and it opened up onto the pool with the beach just beyond. I loved being able to open the patio doors and having sun loungers just there. The pool staff were phenomenal, they saw you before you even had a chance to look for them and arranged the loungers exactly how and where you prefer. The restaurant was brilliant, Samantha and the team really made us feel welcome and greeted us everyday by our names. We ate in White most days but tried out the teppanyaki (brilliant) as well as the restaurant in the wine cellar - Duo. All the food was superb and there’s a wide choice, the Sri Lankan food was super tasty. There is a buffet on Saturdays which guests, not in the hotel, come to so that should show how good it is but they’re willing to cook you anything should you not want the buffet. My husband and I both had spa treatments which we enjoyed, the spa itself is a little dated and it backs onto the main road so you can hear horns beeping whilst having your treatment which was, sadly, not very relaxing. The only other odd and slightly negative thing was in the afternoon whilst by the pool a large number of crows always appeared trying to drink from the pool. The team did attempt to get rid of them but used a sonar detector which omitted a very high pitched noise and didn’t deter the crows - again not very relaxing. That wouldn’t stop us going back, it was one of the most relaxing hotels I’ve been to in a long time. Galle is about 30mins away and the hotel can arrange transport for you. If you like to go in the sea then be warned it’s very rough outside the hotel, we attempted a couple of times but the current is very strong. There were a large number of trainees either serving by the pool, in the bar or in the restaurant - all of them excellent. As well as Samantha, I would like to mention Sashan who looked after our drinks orders night and day! We will definitely be back",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Stunning and comfy,"Gorgeous room, stunning pool, accessible beach and very attentive staff.

Please pass on our thanks to ALL the staff for making our stay a wonderful experience…one we will never forget!",Couples
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Great start to our holiday at The Fortress,"This was one of the first hotels we stayed in on our two week visit to beautiful Sri Lanka.  Everything suited us perfectly.  We had a suite on the ground floor (room 06) which was a few metres from the most fantastic pool.  The rooms were clean, large and well thought out.  The shower was superb as were the shampoos and body products.  We loved the easiness of being able to access the room from the pool.  This hotel only being 50 rooms, there were enough people to create a nice atmosphere but everything (spa, gym and restaurant were within such close proximity.  

It’s extremely well maintained and so very friendly and personable.  Every single member of staff, from chefs (yes we were given a tour of the kitchens of which they are rightly proud!) to the pool staff were just amazing, although I have to say that all Sri Lankans both inside and outside the hotel are delightful and obliging people.  This hotel has 450 full time staff….yes thats a ratio of 4.5 members of staff to every guest so that gives you a clue as to the attention you receive at The Fortress.  At this point I need to highlight ‘Sam’ one of the restaurant managers and ‘Weena’, one of the spa therapists who both went above and beyond, but in all honestly they were all fantastic.

The food was exceptional, both breakfast and dinner (the buffet on a Saturday night is not to be missed)!!  Again service was second to none.

On a very small negative note, the spa could definately upgrade their products (they don’t do gel nails, which may sound minor to any men reading this, but as I’d broken two nails on second day into my holiday it was a right nuisance)!!  I also think they are missing. a trick not having lovely ayuredivic products for sale despite them having a wall of glass display cabinets in the spa with nothing in!  People love to take a few presents and momentos back home with them  and myself and my cousin would love to have purchased gifts  but apart from the little boutique shop which was unfortunately not particularly exciting with nothing desiresble in there (personally I’d close it or completely start again and make it more upmarket ) there was nothing I wanted to bring back home.  As I said these are very minor points and the massages far outweighed the fact they didn’t sell products.

During the course of our two weeks we stayed in four different five star establishments and all very different in their own unique style (the KK Beach, The Galle Face and the kahanda kanda) but for overall  quality, service, food, pool, beach and value for money it is The Fortress hotel and spa that we will be booking for this time next year.  Thank you for making our holiday a truly memorable one….in spite of the copious amounts of rain!!!",Family

Mirissa,Triple O Six,3,Beautiful room but that was it,"We stayed two nights here over New Year’s Eve. The room was beautiful and the location was convenient enough, but the service was pretty terrible and although things looked good, so many things didn’t work ie air con/fridge. There is also no alcoholic bar in this hotel, which isn’t an issue, but worth noting. So trivial, but when checking out, they charged us for water bottles we never ordered or drank. At this point, we were so fed up with trying to talk to the guy on counter who didn’t seem to do anything other than go on his phone, that we just paid up instead of refusing.",Couples

Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,Pleasant stay :),"We were referred to this place. Hence we got a special discount for our double deluxe room. 

Pretty good for a four star hotel I’d say. We had a positive experience right from the point of check in. The process was smooth and easy considering the fact of the on going pandemic. 

Lovely and pleasant staff with full of smiles, we got a nice welcome drink during check in and they got our lunch order then and there itself. 

We enjoyed the pool, the room was comfy and it had all the necessary amenities included. Air con was excellent. We had a set menu for lunch and breakfast. 

This place is great to stay over if you want to get a sneak peak at Coconut Tree Hill. A nice 5 minute walk from the hotel. We went there at sunrise and it was absolutely amazing.

The only down side was their WiFi. Had constant connectivity issues. In the end we just had to give up and use our own mobile data.",Couples

So for the ones who loves to take photographs, this place is far most the best. Lovely hotel rooms, bathrooms are very classy as well for the balcony with a good pleasant view. As well the lobby is really beautiful and very relaxing with the wall paint, also they are accompanying books so anyone can go to the lobby to try the books. And about the food, they have both authentic and foreign menus. Food were really delicious and they looked very good indeed. The staff is very friendly and they are well polite. Room service is excellent. In summary, Triple O’ Six is the best hotel you could ever search in Matara. Highly recommended.",Friends
Mirissa,Triple O Six,5,"Luxurious, modern rooms with stunning décor & great staff","We booked to stay here 5 nights and ended up staying 7 nights due to a government curfew for Covid-19.   

The hotel is new and modern, with friendly and professional staff.  I just loved our room which was the end room on the third floor.  It felt so luxurious with stunning décor.   

We were just a short walk from Coconut Hill and Turtle Point where you can see lots of turtles and have great views.  We were staying in Mirissa to go blue whale watching and scuba diving.  Unfortunately, the tours were cancelled due to Covid restrictions.   We took a tuk tuk as close as we could to Secret Beach, where we had a good time snorkelling.  

There are many restaurants walking distance or a short tuk tuk ride, but we ended up eating at the hotel restaurant most nights because it was clean and offered great food and service.

While be confined to the hotel we were still able to photograph many lovely birds, giant squirrels, palm squirrels, and black purple face langur monkeys.

I couldn’t praise the staff more for the way they looked after us during the Covid restrictions and quickly increased there already high hygiene standards.   

If we had to be in lockdown anywhere, I was so happy it was at Triple O Six.   Thankyou to all the staff for looking after us so well during a very difficult time.

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,The most fantastic holiday in the most amazing hotel in the most beautiful country !,"We had 15 nights in The Fortress and Spa for Christmas 24 and into New Year 25.
The most wonderful time at the most wonderful time of year.
The views as you walk through the enormous wooden gates are fantastic.
Beautiful hotel, fabulous food, amazing staff, brilliant atmosphere, the superlatives dont even come close to describing reality.
We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite - a treat to ourselves as it had a few extras and we had a patio as well as a balcony, but all the rooms were amazing. Our bed was the most comfortable we had ever had in a hotel - and I mean that !!!
Each night our bed was turned down but I insisted on opening the blinds - if I woke up I could still see and hear the sea from our bed.
We stayed on an all inclusive package - we had everything we could possibly wish for. Each day breakfast was a mix of English, continental, fresh fruit, traditional Sri Lankan, delicious local breads, with hot stations serving waffles (if thats your thing), eggs cooked to order, but my favourite, Hoppers and Egg Hoppers.
The infinity pool was brilliant, never too busy, and with views out into the waves.
The staff around the pool were amazing - nothing was too much trouble and we always enjoyed sharing family stories with the team.
We rarely had lunch (breakfast was too amazing).
Evenings started with a cocktail followed by the most amazing dinner fare. Sri Lankan, soup, salads, sushi, anti pasti, seafood cocktails and a grill station with the most mazing seafood. Wonderful wines - the list goes on.
Outside the hotel, the traffic had a beautiful chaos about it - pedestrians and cyclists alongside Tuk-Tuks, cars, trucks and buses - oh the buses challenging tuk tuks to that space ahead but with respect from both sides - we should adopt that attitude in the UK.
We had a list of experiences before we arrived and the hotel staff helped us achieve everything we had wished for - and a whole lot more.
Our sincere thanks to our drivers Subash and Ashintha.
Udawalewe National Park with our friend Subash. A fantastic day with elephants.
On Christmas Eve we had a walk around Galle Fort, Lion Beer in The Ivy, then back at the hotel we saw Santa who presented gifts to all the children before an amazing gala dinner.
Our Christmas Day was wonderful - after breakfast we walked along the amazing beach from the hotel - almost nobody on the beach. We visited the turtle sanctuary - baby turtles seem so helpless.....
Boxing Day was the 20th anniversary of the devastating tsunami and we were humbled to visit the tsunami memorial and statue at Hikkaduwa with our driver Ashintha. We shed many tears for the people of Sri Lanka.
The next day was an early start with Subash as we went to Ella via 9 arch bridge. Then a train ride from Ella to Bandarawela in an open carriage, then onto Liptons seat and ending the day hiking to and swimming in the pools at Upper Diyaluma Falls - an absolutely wonderful day.
Our next adventure was whale watching - wow. A speed boat out to the whales, we saw a Blue whale and mum and baby Fin whales. After we  fished from the boat and caught a tuna!! We walked from Mirissa harbour along the beach towards Coconut Hill - the perfect end to a perfect day.
Next adventure was a boat trip on Kogalla lake - what a fantastic experience. We saw crocodiles, beautiful birds, the biggest monitor lizard we have ever seen and we fed fruit to monkeys.
New Years Eve was a wonderful gala with amazing food, a band and superb fireworks on the beach and on New Years Day we were honoured to take part in the Buddhist New Year blessing - THANK YOU.
Our last trip was to Sigiriya - an amazing place with amazing views.
Our most humble thanks to Subash, Ashintha and all the staff at The Fortress Hotel and Spa. Too many to name individually but you gave us so much pleasure and fun - you know who you are.
My special thanks to the Bar Team - I hope I brought some fun to evenings.
Above all else our special thanks to a wonderful lady - Chamindi, you made our stay so perfect - thank you so so much to you.
THANK YOU - we hope we can visit again in the future and to anyone reading this review - Sri Lanka is beautiful, the people of Sri Lanka are beautiful - need I say more.
Love to everyone at the Fortress Hotel and Spa

Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Simply Incredible,"I have come here with my family and am struck by this breathtaking hotel. It is a beautiful hotel, quaint yet grand. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean, the pool so inviting and the beach boasts of crystal clear waters with rich marine life teeming! The food is delicious and the service is impeccable. 

There was a slight issue we had with the renovation works. The hotel took cognisance of our concerns and extended the best possible help to us for which we are thankful. My brother in law celebrated his anniversary here and we couldn’t have asked for better! 

A shout out to Mr Jinendra, Mr Tihillan, Mr Samantha, Masha, Amasha, Kavisha, Ms Gayani, Mr Lakshsiri the lifeguard, Ms Chamindi and the chefs and staff of the hotel. Menal for a lovely spa treatment and the lovely housekeeping staff! Hope to visit soon again! Thank you Forest Resort & Spa!",Family
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,One of the best hotels I’ve stayed at,"5* all the way!  One of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World and so it is. What an amazing hotel! Once those huge doors of the hotel open and you enter the grounds the first thing you see is the view of the ocean and beautifully Dutch inspired architecture.

Greeted with a smile, welcome drink on arrival, smooth check-in. 

Absolutely stunning property with well appointed rooms. All rooms except The Fortress rooms overlook the ocean. We had the Ocean room and Beach room. Bathrooms well lit and plenty of space. His and her sinks, large shower and jacuzzi bath tub. Choice of pillows options too.. sheer luxury!

Food is of top quality. Chef Asela made sure of that and that our dietary requirements were met… vegan, veg and non veg.All the dishes were excellent and tasty.

Breakfast catered for all palates. A good selection to choose from. There was variety of fruit juices ,curries, Continental food,breads, pastries,omelettes, Hoppers, Sri Lankan dishes …very spoilt for choice.

Management, especially Nadeesha made our stay so comfortable. Always greeted us with a huge welcoming smile.Nothing was too much for her.All our concerns were addressed.

The property itself is very well maintained. Pool is beautiful as are the grounds.

During our stay we made such good friends with everyone that it felt like they were part of our family…it was sad to leave.

 In fact we liked it so much that my daughter and her Fiancée have decided to get married there this year!

A huge thank you to you all for making our stay very memorable and we’re looking forward to seeing you all again this year and making more wedding memories.",Family
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Wonderful family beach hotel,"A fabulous resort! Our family (two adults, two teens) spent three nights at the Fortress and loved every minute!  The rooms are spacious and very clean, and the jacuzzi tub was a wonderful treat.  The enormous pool at this hotel is the star of the show.  We had a relaxing time swimming and lounging at the pool and going for walks on the beach.  We loved our stay and can't wait to return!",Family
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,A very good stay,"Definitely one of my favourite hotels! We were greeted by pleasant staff and appreciated the restaurant's flexibility. We would like to express our gratitude to the restaurant. We had two enjoyable evenings, which enhanced the overall experience.",Family
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,Always memorable.. always wonderful,"As always it was an absolute delight to return to the Fortress which we do every 1-2 years because it is such a wonderful stay and everything is excellent. We love seeing the staff at the Fortress again, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. Even on a rainy day, the Fortress and the atmosphere within the premises shine bright. 

Always recommend the Fortress for a tranquil, happy and memorable stay.",Family
Koggala,The Fortress Resort & Spa,5,"A Perfect Stay, Every Time: Our Favorite Sri Lankan Getaway","This was our third stay at The Fortress Resort, and once again, it exceeded our expectations. We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite, which was absolutely huge, spanning two floors and featuring a spacious indoor plunge pool. The addition of a dedicated butler made the experience even more special.

The room was incredibly spacious, well-lit, soundproofed, and equipped with all the amenities we needed. Although we encountered a minor issue with the electricals, the technical team promptly resolved it. The plunge pool was a highlight for us, with the water maintained slightly above ambient temperature—perfect for us and our child, who thoroughly enjoyed it too.

As always, the food was excellent. We opted for breakfast at the resort and tried in-room dining, which, though slightly more expensive than on our previous visits (likely due to exchange rates), was still worth it for the quality and convenience.

The service was impeccable, with attentive and helpful staff who made our visit truly memorable. This level of hospitality is what keeps bringing us back. The Fortress Resort remains the only place in Sri Lanka that we’ve visited multiple times—and it has consistently surpassed our expectations.

We can’t wait to return for another exceptional stay!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Great food Excellent Service and a Great Location Location,"Riff Hikkaduwa

My wife and myself traveled on Monday the 23rd of June. The experience was great from the point of booking. Indika was nice enough to provide an upgrade to a junior suite at the point of booking itself.

Location:
This property is situated at a very convenient location bordering the main road at Hikkaduwa with a large seafront. The beach is very clean and beautiful. Since we travelled in the off season, the sea was rough and not suitable for sea bating. Buth the sea was beautiful with large waives and splashes. 

Facilities:
This hotel has a spacious living area and two restaurants. One is situated at the ground floor and the other one, a Japanese Restaurant, is situated at the roof top. The hotel has a nice little library, a spa and a gym as well. 

Rooms:
The rooms are modern and very clean. It has very good ambiance in the rooms. The bed is comfortable. The room has tea and coffee making facilities, a shaving kit, shower caps, sewing kit etc. that are very handy. Our room was upgraded to the Junior Site by the hotel without even requesting the same and that suit was large and well maintained. 

Garden:
There is a garden area with several chairs and pool decks that let people relax. The pool is a small one, but it is enough for a mid-size hotel such as the Riff. 

Food:
The food was ample and tasty. The food provided by the hotel is very tasty. The restaurant staff were the main plus point of this hotel. The four-course menu was too much for both of us as the portions were very generous. All the food that we ate was very tasty. The desserts were also very good with the home-made ice cream being the best. 

Service:
The Benisha was very attentive and the boy who served us, Reshmika, was accommodated to all our requests very much willingly and with a smile on his face. They went out of their way to serve us better. All the other people on the restaurant team, including the girl who served us dinner and the other boy on duty today were also excellent.    

Overall:
I could recommend this hotel to any person coming to enjoy a good relaxing holiday with good food and good service.",Couples

. Can’t fault anything. 
Everything about a boutique beach holiday is perfect with this hotel.  Staff couldn’t be more polite and helpful, transfer from airport in a lovely limo,  our room is beautiful, bathroom spacious, food is excellent, breakfast spectacular, every room has an ocean view, rooftop bar exceptional as is the sunset.

Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Do not miss Riff Hikkaduwa,This was one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. I arrived and was greeted by this delicious pineapple lychee iced tea. The staff were super friendly and attentive. Breakfast was a la carte and some of the nicest food I had in Sri Lanka. The rooftop bar was stunning and so nice to watch the sun go down. Laying out by the pool was divine. Still dreaming about this place honestly.,Solo
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Luxury At The Beach.,"Located at the southern end of Hikkadua beach, this is a high end hotel. Luxury cars are parked at the entrance and there’s a wonderful pool at the rear before you head onto the beach itself. There are nice restaurants on the ground floor and there’s terrace. You have use of the pool for a small fee. On the roof terrace, you see a spectacular view of Hikkadua beach itself. It’s wonderful at sunset and very romantic.

Staff are immaculately dressed, professional, engaging and attentive. I’ve swam in several pools in Hikkadua and this is so far the best one. Not too much chlorine and it’s colder than other pools also. The view overlooks the beach. The cascading waves that crash into the beach is fantastic. The pool area is surprisingly peaceful and idyllic. Recommended.",Solo
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Absolutely spectacular - Five stars!,"Where do I start?

The atmosphere is both calm and welcoming! Staff opened the car door, helped with my bags, welcomed me in the lobby with a drink and showed me to my room with a quick but informative tour.

And what a room! And what a view! And what a tub! And I could just keep going. I had a permanent grin on my face during my stay and I so regret not booking more nights! The room was amazing, it was clean, cool and well prepared for my stay, even had some classical music playing as I arrived. The balcony was large and had a great view of the pool area, palm trees and the ocean. From the tub and shower you could also take in part of the view.

The pool and pool area was very calm! Most people had chairs down on the beach so I could even swim alone in the pool. Staff was very careful to inform and ensure that no guest went into the ocean due to rough waves for our own security. Once you find a chair on the beach or by the pool they bring you towels and a refreshing water bottle.

Dinner on the rooftop was relaxed, only a few guests and food was tasty and service quick. Breakfast was also a good experience! Attentive staff, easy to order, many options and what a view!

The only complaints I have are few. Firstly I wish the bed was softer. Secondly I would have liked to have been informed that while I went for a massage a member of staff would enter my room after check-in to get it ready for the evening by pulling down the curtain and undoing/redoing the bedlinens. Thirdly the prices shown on the massage-menu are not the actual price and I was not informed during booking but only when I arrived for the massage. Seeing as I had been looking forward to it I was not likely to cancel then. The massage was nice, although I would have liked the massagebed to have a spot to rest my arms while lying on my stomach. 

All in all it was great! The Riff is by far the best hotel I have ever visited and before leaving I was already planning my next trip back!

Thank you for a wonderful stay!",Solo
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Sri Lankan paradise,"For me it was the first time staying in the hotel rather than my friend. Everything was perfect! Firstly we decided to stay only for 2 nights and then moved to another place but after all cancelled our next destination and came back to Riff Hikkaduwa! The location is great - nice beach and shore, lack of people and noise. Rooms are clean and nice, the views are stunning. Highly recommended! 
Thanks to front office team for the high level of hospitality and service - Lalith, Malshi, Beenu, for the great gesture and yummy food to F&B team - Chamod, Theekshana, Ravindra, Sachintha, Pasan, Danushka, Ananda! I would like to mention also security guy Ashoka, he was so friendly and nice and housekeeping guy Roshan that took care of us all our staying near the pool.

Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Where My Flip-Flops Feel at Home,"This isn’t just a hotel — it’s my place. I keep coming back to Riff Hikkaduwa for one reason: it’s perfect. The food, the vibe, the beach, the staff — everything feels easy, stylish, and full of heart.

The front office dream team — Lalith, Malshi, Beenu — always make me feel like a VIP. They already know my name, my favorite view, and probably my breakfast order by now!

Big love to Chamod, Theekshana, Ravindra, Sachintha, Pasan, Danushka, and Ananda — you guys are the real stars of the show. So friendly, fun, and always making sure everything is just right.

The F&B team? Next-level. I’m convinced the chefs here are secretly magicians.
And Ashoka from Security — thank you for always watching over everything with calm vibes and a kind smile.

The Japanese on the rooftop was excellent and so was all the other meals. Love the set menu concept and the choice you get for breakfast. Benisha at the restaurant was a 💯 always with a smile and ready to help you. 
Overall it’s a gem of a place!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Close to perfection!,"A wonderful hotel! It’s smaller designer hotel, right on the beach.
The views are fantastic, the rooms large and beautiful. Staff are super friendly and helpful.
You can lie on the sunbeds and order drinks, which is not a given in Sri Lanka.( currently staying at the Taj in Bentota- they have no beach facilities- you have to pay to use sunbeds, no drink or food).
The breakfast was a la carte, and very good. Cool rooftop bar/japanese restaurant- great food and drinks with relaxing live music.
I truly loved this hotel!
Only con- is that the sea was too choppy to swim in this time of year- so would look into that if planning a trip!",Solo
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Great Stay on a Beautiful Beach,"Loved this small hotel—big comfy rooms, amazing food, and top-notch service. The beach is gorgeous, though not swimmable during the offseason. Luckily, there’s a safe spot just 10 minutes away. I’d come back just for the food and service!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Fantastic stay,"I stayed at this hotel in March and had a fantastic experience. The staff were incredibly friendly, and both my friend and I really enjoyed our time there. I arrived early on the first day, and thankfully, they allowed us to check in ahead of time, which was much appreciated.

The hotel is located right by the seafront, offering lovely views. However, the sea can be quite rough, so it's not really suitable for swimming.

The area around the hotel is fairly quiet, but there are a couple of great restaurants just in front of the hotel that I’d recommend: Two Brothers Palace (cash only) and Bella’s (accepts both cash and card). Both offer authentic and delicious food.
The hotel is about 30 minutes to an hour away from other popular spots like Mirissa and Galle. I’d recommend taking a taxi, which is quite affordable—around £20 for a round trip. We used a company called Less taxi throughout our trip.

The hotel also helped us book an excursion for £126, which included a visit to Ella and the Elephant Sanctuary. A hotel staff member picked us up at 4 AM in a comfortable Mercedes van equipped with Wi-Fi and chargers. He stayed with us throughout the day and ensured everything went smoothly. They even provided a generous breakfast box for the trip. All in all, a really memorable and well-organized experience.

When we checked out the hotel they kindly gifted us some Sri Lankan tea – would highly recommend this hotel.",Friends

A minor price premium over a local restaurant ensured a very superior experience indeed.
Top marks!",Couples
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Beautiful modern boutique hotel on a stunning beach,"We stayed at Riff for five nights in February after a week of touring Srilanka. It was a great stay! All the staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. Hotel is really beautiful and the views from the rooms are stunning. 
Food was great, really diverse choice for breakfast. Not a buffet stile but I loved it even more. I tried different things every day, and everything was yummy. We had lunch by the pool every day. Also had dinner at Japanese restaurant on the top floor twice and it was delicious. 

Best thing was a beautiful infinity pool, chairs on the beach ( you can always find a spot ) and a gorgeous white sand beach. Waves in front of the hotel were too big for swimming in the sea but I could have watched them whole day :) you can swim just few minutes walk down the beach. And it is a great place for surfing so we tried that also. There are lots of restaurants on the beach also great food. And great beach for morning run/walk. We even had a turtle come one night and laid eggs in front of the hotel.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,10/10 safari experience,"10/10 experience. My now husband and I are on our honeymoon and thought this place would be amazing to stay at. Indeed, it exceeded our expectations. 

The camp is nested far in the jungle, so it’s super remote and far away from everything. Our accommodations were amazing, like it was straight out of a safari camping magazine. The staff had been fantastic, extremely attentive. 

We did only one day here, which was the perfect amount of time. We had time for one half day of safari, which we saw a lot of water buffalo, crocodiles, deer, and even a bear sloth! The park is known for the leopards, but unfortunately we did not come across any. I guess there’s always a next time!

I’d say this place is PERFECT for couples. At night, they set you up a candle lit dinner under the stars. Very romantic. Since it was our honeymoon, they even treated us to champagne at dinner. We felt so special!",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,"Glamping + safari, truly exceptional","Wow, what an experience. When we pulled up into the camp, there was an elephant just there (a tusker no less). The standards were consistently high from there. We were well looked after by the manager Ravi, with impeccable service throughout. My wife's gluten free requirement being well looked after. The views are stunning, the food was great. At camp we sat and watched birds, and beyond seeing an elephant we saw a leopard just crossing the road outside! Before going to bed... Shine a torch into the canopy overhead, and there was a polecat (civet), desperately climbing away from us!

Two days of safari in yala, were two of the best of our lives. Elephants, leopards, bears, birds, jackals, buffalo... Achi (driver) made sure we didn't miss a thing. 10/10, if you love nature, don't hesitate to stay here.",Couples

The food, in particular the lunch was the best Sri Lankan/Indian food we have ever tasted. Promod the chef is the best! 

I couldn’t recommend highly enough, and have already began telling friends and family they must come visit.

Thanks Ravi and team, we loved it!",Friends
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Incredible experience,"Absolutely incredible time here. Ravi tended to all our needs and nothing was a hassle for him. Nero took us on a half day safari in Block 5 and full day in Block 1 - we saw leopards and sloth bears plus much more. He was an expert in bird species and worked so hard to find what we wanted to see, he ended up finding the sloth bears on his own by knowing what foods it ate and where it would hang out. We could tell he really cared for the wildlife.
The food was amazing, the lunch on arrival was one of the best Sri Lankan meals we’ve had here, I’d happily eat that eggplant curry for the rest of my life.",Couples

,Yala Safari Camping,5,Beautiful  experience at Yala Safari Camp,Amazing experoence with nicwst staff and owners in Yala Safari Csmp.. from the initial planning stage till our last day in the camp we were showered with sincere hospitality and putting guests as priority always. Individually we connected too with the staff.. the villa was a once in lifwtime e perience.. clean spacious im the jungle and yet comfortable. Special mention to 2 key staff namely Ravi and Niro.. Ravi was the go to person.wgocoordinated everything to ensure qe were happy.. while Niro is the man who will get yoy what u want or came there for.. because of his sincere heart to get us see the wild leopards he diligently and tirelessly drove around till we had to ask him to stop and it was ok. He was like a God-sent person where we sighted and took many photos/videos of not 1 but 2 leopards on the final day safari!

Thank you to owner Mahesh who was so humble and sincere to facilitate all our needs and last munute requests!,Family
,Yala Safari Camping,5,"An Unforgettable, Magical Safari Experience","We booked 2 nights with 2 half days, and 1 full day of safari. We had the most amazing time!

Achi our driver and guide was a magician, he seemed to know where the animals were going to appear before any other jeep! We saw two leopards and mother & child sloth bears over the 3 safaris which are quite rare to see (also many elephants, buffalo, deer, birds & crocs). Achi went out of his way to ensure we were happy, comfortable and spotting as much wildlife as possible.

On site, the tents were luxurious and comfortable with Aircon & the restaurant is a cosy inside-outside experience where you may see chipmunks, lizards and giant squirrels whilst dining. However the highlight is the balcony area which has the most incredible panoramic views of the surrounding national park. 

The food was divine and we were served plenty of it! We had a mix of Sri Lankan and Western food - the Sri Lankan lunch platter on the first day was the best food we had on our trip courtesy of Chef Promos! 

We would definitely recommend this tour :)",Family
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Luxuriate in the jungle in every sense of the way,"What an amazing time we had at yala safari camping! The place is magical - completely immersed in the jungle, with trees as far as the eye can see and the mountains in the distance. Something out of a story book. The main reception area is perched high up with a sprawling terrace overlooking the jungle, which makes it a great place to watch the sunrise and to witness far away lightning in the night. The sounds of the jungle are ever present reminding you at all times that you’re a part of this vibrant and lush ecosystem. Our « tent » (it’s not really a tent, definitely more like a luxury cabin) was in front of a lily pad pond and the sounds of the frogs made it a super relaxing place to sleep - no need for a sound machine there! When we arrived we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff and served a Sri Lankan meal with vegetable curries and jumbo prawns which was delicious. We then went on our first safari half day with Achi in block 5 where we spotted elephants, a leopard and plenty of monkeys, deers and various birds. The game drive is also a fascinating observation of how the drivers exchange information and try their best to get you in position for a sighting - from a monkey call to the behaviour of the deer, they’re able to analyse and read nature to hope for the glimpse of a leopard - but to be fair we were just happy being there, seeing the nature and smelling the jungle. That’s the biggest joy of being out there. The next day, we went to a full day drive on block 1 with Niro, and we loved how he spent time showing us various birds - from eagles to egret, kingfishers and bee-eaters - he had a keen eye to spot and we were fascinated with all that we discovered in the jungle. We even saw another leopard walking peacefully down the road, a family of elephants bathing, a malabar pied horn bill, painted storks, mongooses, monitor lizards, deer, grey langurs, and even Sri Lankan’s national animal the giant squirrel. 
On our last day, we went on a bush walk with Chamara, and walked through the rain forest and climbed a small (manageable) mountain to get incredible views. He also took some great pictures of us :) overall Ravi (the manager) and his team gave us an unforgettable experience and were lovely, attentive and kind throughout our stay with great attention to detail across everything - from the cleanliness of the room to the way they set the tables, to the myriad of oil lamps that are placed every night to illuminate the place. Definitely one to remember and return to.",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Amazing experience for the family!,"Family of four (2 kids under 6) visiting for 3 days 2 nights. The whole day safari was amazing. Ask for Niro as he will do his very best to show you different animals. We were lucky to see a leopard two separate times. With his experience, he also shows you a lot of other animals that most likely you would not have seen. The Safari ride will be long, be patient as their experienced drivers look out for animals for you to see.
The rooms are nice and have air-conditioning. Understand that you’re in the middle of nature, so there will be some bugs. We did not get a squirrel in our tent because we kept our food and suitcases locked up. There was no Wi-Fi in the room, but we had our own SIM card so it was fine. And you’re really here to disconnect from everything and just enjoy nature.
The staff are all genuine and they all have great smiles. I would happily do this whole experience again.",Family
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Excellent experience,"Had the best experience at Yala Safari Camping.  The team here put in maximum effort in all aspects - service, food, drinks and the safari experiences were all exceptional.  We did a one night package with our three teens - we all loved it.  The tents are quite amazing really - literally in the middle of nowhere with all comforts.  It's rustic but that's to be expected.  The viewing platform/restaurant area is amazing.  One of the highlights of our trip.",Family

,Yala Safari Camping,5,Excellent customer service,"Great time with excellent food and customer service. We mostly saw peacocks, monkeys, deer, many different types of birds during the safari. What animals you see are dependent on the season and time of day. Luxurious campsite, make sure to hide any snacks or foods/keep them in your suitcases, as the squirrels love to get into it.

Colombo,Colombo Court Hotel & Spa,5,In Colombo cultural epicenter,"From beautifully proportioned rooms to open air spaces, the hotel stands a s aven of tranquility minutes away from the busting heart of the city. What used to be 3 houses alongside Colombo main road was metamorphosed into a boutique hotel. Though multi storey constructions have since sprouted out of the ground by the Galle green, the Colombo Court standa as a witness of the intricate balance of Colombo spirit ,: between offshore influences, lush nature and climate and bustling energy of the Sri Lankan people, it reflects urban tropical modernism in a applied acception.
Once checked-in  never to be forgotten. Mishfa and Mohammed at the reception are more family than hosts. Always keen to keep in touch and assist with additional support.",Solo

I loved the full body aromatherapy massage at the amber spa given by an Indonesian lady sudharmi. She was professional and I felt relaxed even though spa was simple and small. The food at the roof top cloud cafe was delicious. Compliments to the chef! The breakfast platters served at the poolside cafe were good especially the srilankan platter. The water temperature in the pool was perfect. Jacuzzi offered a cool dip. It is not a hot jacuzzi as summer time it is hot outside. Location was perfect as the marino mall is only a 7 minute walk and it offers a variety of halal restaurants serving srilsnkan, far eastern, Chinese and Arabic food.

Kandy,Skyloft Kandy By Aaradhya,5,Absolute Heaven in the Mountains of Kandy- A Must-Stay!,"Absolute Heaven in the Mountains of Kandy - A Must-Stay!

My wife and I recently celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary in Sri Lanka, starting our trip in Colombo, but the true highlight was our decision to stay at Skyloft Kandy by Aaradhya. It was truly the best decision my wife made for this trip!

From the very first call, I was incredibly impressed. The hotel reception staff, especially Avindu, was so attentive, understanding, and genuinely warm in clarifying all my queries and demands – it immediately convinced me to book. Their welcome and warmth touched my heart even before arrival. Avindu even helped us click some beautiful pictures!

While the drive up the tiny mountain roads at night was a bit scary, waking up at Skyloft Kandy is like entering absolute heaven. You are immediately surrounded by lush green mountains and cozy gardens. Our room balcony offered stunning views of the sky changing colors above the mountains, with little birds adding to the serene ambiance. The peace and tranquility are exactly what a nature lover seeks. I highly recommend staying in Room R109 for an unparalleled experience.

The entire team at Skyloft Kandy is exceptional. The General Manager is truly hands-on, always on the move, ensuring every little detail is perfect. All the staff are incredibly nice and respectful of privacy; we often felt like we had the entire hotel to ourselves, aside from a few guests during breakfast. Their genuine warmth and willingness to cater to any requests, even outside the usual hotel services, truly sets them apart. This level of personalized care and attention is what truly makes a stay memorable, even if the rooms themselves might seem a little 'dull' to some – the people and their hospitality shine brightest.

The hotel's facilities are also fantastic. The pool and rooftop bar offer absolute peace with breathtaking views. Breakfast options are very good and reasonable for the price. The restaurant food options are also reasonably priced.

We had two fantastic day trips: a full day to Nuwara Eliya (""Little England"") and an exploration of Kandy. Our guide, Mr. Christy, was exceptional. He is super loyal, knowledgeable, and made us feel entirely comfortable and confident throughout our journeys. He understood our need for privacy, maintaining a respectful distance while ensuring we got the best outcome from our excursions. We had an unforgettable, private bath at Ramboda Waterfall, surrounded by beautiful nature. He truly helped us experience all the worthwhile tourist attractions.

If you are looking for an eco-friendly, nature lover's paradise with complete silence, uninterrupted mountain views, and genuine, warm hospitality, then choose to stay at Skyloft Kandy. The ambiance is amazing, the atmosphere is great, and the people truly make this place shine.",Couples

Nuwara Eliya,Jetwing St. Andrew's,3,A disappointing experience.,"The gardens and public areas of this hotel are delightful. Manicured English gardens, charming sitting areas with comfy old world furnishings and open fires, walls covered in interesting photos and memorabilia from a bygone era, billiards room with full sized table, quiet nooks to relax and read a book and a lovely restaurant serving a great buffet breakfast not to mention the congenial, English pub style atmosphere of the bar. It’s the rest of the hotel that lets it down. The corridors are dark and smell musty, the rooms tired and in serious need of updating. Of the three windows in my room, only one could be opened without an effort, there was no fridge in the room, the TV didn’t work (no biggie for me as I was too busy to want to watch, but this shouldn’t happen) . The hot water bottles delivered to the room every evening were a nice touch but necessary as the rooms had no heating or cooling and Nuwara Eliya gets quite cold at night. Despite this, only once thin bedcover was provided, necessitating the donning of extra clothes once the hot water bottles cooled down. The staff were very accommodating and if people complained, issues were fixed. For example, a fridge was delivered to a room when asked for, however, in a 5* hotel this amenities should be standard. While I enjoyed my stay at St Andrew’s, I certainly wouldn’t rate it as 5 star.",Friends
Nuwara Eliya,Jetwing St. Andrew's,5,6 out of 5 stars,Such a lovely experience. The staff went above and beyond! If you come to Sri Lanka I would highly recommend you stay here. Whilst your here have the hotel book a tuk tuk and do a 1 hour tour of the city sites and play some golf,Business

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,"Good value, does the job.","We chose this hotel as we were only staying one night before getting the train. It is a good, central location. There was a lot of traffic noise because of the location but we slept fine with ear plugs. 
The staff were nice and helpful, the room was clean and spacious. Good shower, comfortable bed. Only weird thing was that there were blinds on the windows but there was no way to keep them open. There wasnt much of a view and we weren't in the room for long so it didnt matter really.
Breakfast was good, lots of choice and served quickly.
I would recommend this for a quick stay and if you want to be close to the train station. Maybe a bit noisy and basic if you want to enjoy your time in the hotel.",Couples
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,A decent hotel in downtown Kandy,"Rooms are basic but clean and comfortable, for the price range, it's a perfectly acceptable place - 10 minutes walk from the train and bus station so no need to take a Tuk Tuk you can walk it easily
In the afternoon and morning, we had a parade of monkeys across our balcony, it's worthwhile staying home to watch but keep the balcony door closed",Couples
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,"Comfortable, but nothing special about the surrounding area","The Sevana doesn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it is spacious with lots of public seating areas and great views from the rooftop. We stayed here on two separate occasions and both times it was good. Rooms are comfortable, staff are helpful. There’s a filtered water fountain with reusable glass bottles you can take to your room. The hotel organised a car and driver for us; both the car and the driver were very good, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka. There’s not many good eating options nearby, but we did find a good little restaurant across the road which did excellent dosas. The only downside is the location, which is a bit away from the main attractions, although it’s easy to get a tuk tuk to wherever you want to go. If you choose to use the hotel's recommenced driver, you will pay more than one that you wave down, but he is very pleasant, reliable and drives comparatively carefully.",Couples

The rooms sizes seem reasonable. The staff were all very lovely and helpful and the location is close to the lake (10 minutes walk). The bathroom was large and the water was hot. Breakfast was nice but expensive and Wi-Fi was excellent. Sadly, The decor of the room was in poor condition and needs redecorating. Wallpaper is peeling and walls are marked. The window blinds were all broken. The pool and surrounding area did not look inviting at all. The pool looks dirty. Such a shame.

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,3,"A good-value, central stop over for a night or two in Kandy.","Pros:

A family run hotel, centrally located and deceptively small from the exterior – blink and you'd miss it. However, there were many floors and little restaurant and pool on the very top floor. The pool was small, but decent enough to enjoy a refreshing dip and observe the city from high up.

The food was extremely delicious, generous and well-cooked. Service was excellent – very friendly.

The beds were comfy, the shower was hot and the air conditioning worked well.

There was free wi-fi available and a water dispenser so that you could fill up your bottles.

Cons:

The pool was not lit up at night (unlike the pictures), so it was quite dark to swim in, but it the weather was so hot we did anyway.

Unfortunately, the night we stayed there was some kind of Hindu festival going at the (very) nearby temple. For hours there were prayers/talking and trumpet playing through loudspeakers onto the street. It was impossible to escape the noise, other than go elsewhere, but we were tired and my husband was not feeling very well, so we just surrendered to it. I should point out that this was a case of bad luck and I'm sure that it would not normally be like this.",None

Wattala,Pegasus Reef Hotel,4,Upgrade in progress,"This is my 4 or 5th time at Pegasus and I'm happy to say that there is some sort of refurbishment that is taking place. when booked and heard about the refurbishment, I was a bit septic and worried about the noise. To my surprise there was very less noise except at the temporary restaurant. 
Also, some of the rooms are being renovated. 
Saying that a lot of improvements to be seen. The guest relations team is checking on the needs of the guests and as a repeat guest, a lot of staff recognises you.
Not only the front of the house staff but all those who do not come in direct contact with guests are doing a wonderful job. To name a few. Isuru from the gym, Basil from the animation team and the Indian chef and his team. Bringing down a Indian. chef is has been one good thing to  increase the variety. The food is always good at Pegasus.
I know I have forgotten more names but next time, I will definitely include them. Adding photos of a few staff with their full consent. 
Pegasus needs to be more consistent on the standards.  For example, tissue boxes were available last year in the toilet but this year only on request,  the guest relations team hands in plates of chocolate and biscuits but one day, it's two pieces and another just one. Keep up the good work and improve the standards.",Friends

Colombo,"Itc Ratnadipa, A Luxury Collection Hotel, Colombo",5,"Thoughtful Hospitality, Great Food & Views — Our Honeymoon at ITC","We stayed here for our honeymoon — and it genuinely made the trip feel special from the very start.

The property is stunning. Brand new, with clean, modern architecture and a calm energy throughout. We had a partial sea-facing room, which still offered a beautiful view — you could sit by the window for hours and just watch the ocean and city fade into each other.

The interiors were tasteful — minimal yet warm — and the in-room experience was smooth throughout. It never felt flashy or overwhelming, just simple luxury done right.

One of the biggest highlights was dining at Avartana. If you’re visiting, don’t miss it. It’s not your usual Indian fine-dine — it’s a full tasting experience with a carefully curated menu, incredible plating, and an ambience that really sets the tone. The storytelling behind each dish made the night feel like more than just dinner — it was a whole experience.

Some worth mentions are their high tea in the evening, the views and sunsets are breathtaking everyday, we satyed for 5 days, and we went there every day without missing it.

Do try their hand made nachos if you get a chance, those were delicious.

Also, there is infinity pool facing the sea, a sky lounge as well, free casino travel.

If you go to casino balies is worth visiting.

Massive thanks to Rephan Castelino, who helped us throughout the stay — from small details to last-minute help, he was just fantastic. Super professional, and made everything feel effortless.

If you’re planning a honeymoon or just want a relaxed luxury stay in Colombo — this place is absolutely worth it. Great food, peaceful rooms, kind staff, and just the right amount of quiet luxury.",Couples

Colombo hotels seem to be in a race to provide the most luxurious facilities and best service. The ITC, opened just over two years ago, is a recent entry. The huge reception lobby on the second level gives a sweeping view of the ocean. The rooms are spacious and appointed nicely. There are some nice details, such as the lilly inlays in places like the room paneling and elevator flooring. The electrical outlets are all universal, accepting plugs from around the world. 

The staff were exceptional from the moment I walked in. I wish I had noted more names.

Suresh at the bell station helped me from the beginning and throughout my stay. Shaiya checked me  in. I was glad to to see Erandhi providing the same fine service that she brought from when I first saw when she worked previously at another property.

The friendly owner of the hotel also owns the tea company, which made it even more special.

I was particularly impressed by the hotel's plastic-free policy. Even the trash bags were made of paper, which made me feel good about my consumption choices. We opted for full-board, and the food was delicious and varied, served à la carte. I would like to give a big compliment to the chef for consistently meeting all of our special requests. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout our stay.

The hotel also features a rooftop bar, which is particularly stunning during sunset hours. The view from up there is breathtaking, making it a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Additionally, at the same location, there’s a Japanese restaurant that serves delicious sushi. We had the chance to try it, and it was a great dining experience—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. A wonderful addition to our stay!

The hotel has direct access to the beach, and the loungers by the pool and on the beach were comfortable. There were also plenty of umbrellas for shade. I especially enjoyed sitting by the pool with a natural shade refreshing King Coconut, gazing out at the sea. Trees provided shade, and the cool breeze made it a pleasant place to relax during the hot midday hours.

The beach was clean, and compared to the rest of the southern coastline, the water was also quite clear. However, I believe this may change depending on the season. The sea directly in front of the hotel wasn't ideal for swimming due to strong currents, but we had fun jumping in the waves. About 2 km south, there’s a place called Dodanduwa Beach where you can safely enter the water, even with children. It's a great spot for beginner surfers to try standing on the board for the first time.

If you're into snorkeling, you should definitely check out Hikkaduwa Beach, about 2 km north of the hotel. You can easily get there with a tuk-tuk for only 500 LKR. The water is crystal clear, and plenty of colorful fish can be admired. The only downside was the occasional boat traffic and the smell of kerosene, which could be a bit bothersome. The beach does offer natural shade, but since it’s public, there didn’t seem to be any regulations on the boats.

The only thing that could have made this stay even more perfect would have been a makeup mirror with light in the bathroom, which would have been the cherry on top of an unforgettable and truly relaxing vacation with my family.",Family

Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Magical stay in hikk,This hotel is one of the best we have stayed in and certainly the best we have stayed in during our 3 weeks in sri lanka.

Would fully recommend this hotel.,Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Luxury boutique hotel with beachside access and amazing food,"My favourite hotel in the country. The beachside location is excellent and the design of the hotel is very modern and stylish. Beautiful and spacious rooms overlook an infinity pool facing the beach, with all the commodities one would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff are very friendly and professional, readily accommodating even the smallest requests with efficiency. The rooftop bar is also a great place to relax with comfortable seating for large groups and great views of Hikkaduwa beach from above. The live music is always spot on, with different musicians performing in the evenings from Wednesday to Sunday, perfectly complementing the chilled atmosphere of the venue.

A special mention must be made to the food. Every item on the menu tastes amazing and the selection for all three meals has a lot of variety. The seafood platter is my personal favourite but the Japanese menu is second to none, especially the crispy crab maki rolls. Easily the best sushi in Sri Lanka, outclassing most places offering a similar selection abroad. 

Highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious and satisfying stay. Even if you are not staying here, the restaurant is well worth a visit for anyone who is passing by hikkaduwa.",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Paradise,"Stayed 5 nights and fell in love with Riff Hikkaduwa. All rooms have a balcony and face the ocean.

On our first night we went to their Christmas Eve Gala Dinner with an incredible buffet and great music. We really enjoyed ourselves and the food was delicious. 

We were particularly well looked after by Belisha and will definitely recommend Riff to everyone.",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,"Amazing hotel, fantastic service :)","I had a wonderful six night stay at Riff, the service was outstanding and all staff extremely polite and friendly and can’t do enough for you.
The rooms are incredibly clean with everything you need and beautiful views over the beach. I stayed over the Christmas period and noticed a few lovely gestures, like freshly made gingerbread biscuits and handmade chocolate Christmas trees being delivered to the room in the early evening. Very nice touches. 
The food in the True Blue rooftop bar is lovely, and again, very attentive service. 

The only very small thing that could be a great addition to feel like complete luxury, is to provide a more efficient beverage service at the beachside sun loungers, rather than having to go into the main hotel to order drinks during the day. Saying that, the beachside attendant was super helpful in bringing a bottle of cold water in the mornings, which was fully appreciated. 

The hotel is also in a great location, very relaxed part of the beach yet only a 5-10 minute walk to the bars and restaurants of Hikkaduwa. 

Thank you Riff for a wonderful experience 🙏🏼",Solo

We have to give a huge shout out to the hotel driver who picked us up and dropped us off at Colombo Airport - as well as taking us out for a day to Yala National Park where we had the good fortune to not only see elephants and mugger crocodiles but also a leopard.

Breakfast was excellent and both restaurants have good food and varied menus.  This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the hotel was well placed to not only relax but to also see some of the country, the Old Fort in Galle being another great visit.

The rooms were extremely well fitted, smart and comfortable. Reception, Housekeeping and Room Service were warm, friendly, helpful and efficient. 

Some quibbles: 
1. The Deluxe Room during my first stint had two odd cement blocks right in the middle of the room blocking view of the TV from almost all angles. 
2. Some work needs to be done on the Menu. The choice of soups is limited and unimaginative. For a coastal hotel, fish options are slender. Further, one had expected the Menu to have a set Sri Lankan meal, vegetarian and non-vegetarian.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,An immersive safari experience,"A flawless experience. Highly recommend. Takes all the hassle out of booking safaris. The Accomodation is outstanding and the team are amazing. 

From the moment we arrived, we were wowed by the campsite, the cabins are amazing. The manager Ravi made us feel welcome and very quickly we’d met a giant squirrel, seen monkeys and deer just on the site. 

The food was fantastic every time. And the team made sure we always had a drink. Best of all was being greeted after a long day of safari with a ginger and coconut drink. It was exactly what we needed. 

We had two safari drivers and they were both brilliant. Lakmal and Achi were super knowledgeable and did everything they could to get us the best sightings and help us understand the landscape. Achi has an incredible camera and he’s more than happy to take pictures for you (like the leopard pic attached!).

Yala is a beautiful park with lots to offer. The main attraction is the leopard and we saw 3 in two days, but you’ll get more out of it if you’re happy to be entertained by amazing birds, deer and monkeys. 

We will never forget our stay, there’s no better way to immerse yourself in nature than these cabins with panoramic views, comfy beds, air conditioning and a sunken bath in the room.",Friends

Overall a really wonderful experience, would definitely recommend the stay and safari. I have seen a couple of reviews from others who didn’t get the package they expected, all I can say is I had great communication with Mahesh before our trip, we confirmed what was included in our stay and package and we had no surprise or hidden costs, I thought the cost was very reasonable for the location, staff, food and safaris!
Thank you for a wonderful stay!",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Wild luxury with a personal touch,"We spent two nights at Yala Safari Camping and really enjoyed the mix of proper wildlife experiences with laid-back comfort. The accommodation isn’t your usual tent – more like canvas-walled cabins with solid floors, proper beds, and private bathrooms. Definitely glamping territory, but still feels connected to the landscape.

The camp is fully off-grid, powered by solar, with filtered water and eco-conscious touches throughout. Our guide, who also runs the place, was fantastic – hugely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the park. We saw a leopard attempt a hunt, loads of birds, and had some close encounters with elephants that we won’t forget anytime soon.

Also… the food was exceptional. The lobster at lunch on day one completely caught us off guard – fresh, full of flavour, and beautifully cooked.

Would absolutely recommend this if you’re after something a bit more personal and sustainable than the big lodge-style options.",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Beyond Expectations,"A really special.camp . We were looked after beautifully from the moment we arrived to when we left. The whole team were superb
 On arrival we were greeted and then invited to an amazing lunch, or a banquet even, of large shrimp, lentl daahl , local vegetables poppadoms etc it was glorious. 

Our tents were large with a comfortable big bed, a bath, shower and power.

The game drive the following day to The national park was really good too and Lape  was our guide. Very kind, knowledgeable and fun. (The only down was if there was a sighting of leopard all the jeeps turned up, making for a horrible experience) however we asked Lape to move on away and we sourced our own journey, and birds, animals and views. 

The food at YSC was outrageously  delicious and the chef Promod, wonderful and there were 2 young boys on work experience who were also really sweet and helpful. But the WHOLE  team, led by Ravi were fantastic. I totally recommend. But you need to be mobile enough to navigate a bridge and 60 steps.",Friends
,Yala Safari Camping,5,An adventure that should not be missed,"We stayed at the Yala camping area for one night. We booked two Safaris - one in the afternoon, one in the early morning. We have never experienced anything that special before. The breathtaking views, the enormous safari area, all those beautiful animals (the driver stopped at all the right places for us and helped us spot many animals). The whole stuff made great efforts to make our stay as convenient as possible. Not only did they provide a huge variety of food, but also did they turn the dinner into a romantic atmosphere by putting up the tables with a spectacular view of the green landscapes. 
We slept in a wooden tent/cabin which felt cozy. 
We are glad that we decided to come here as it‘s an experience we will be talking about a lot in the future. We want to thank Ravi and the rest of the team of Yala Safari Camping for creating a beautiful memory.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,The highlight of our Sri Lanka holiday,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. From the minute we arrived we knew we were in for a fabulous time. The food was outstanding - the best I have eaten in Sri Lanka, the  staff were so helpful and friendly and the amazing safari experiences made this a most unforgettable and enjoyable holiday. The professionalism , knowledge and experience of our safari drivers was second to none.  A once in a lifetime experience. We will never forget this part of our holiday - we were totally satisfied. If you  are thinking about staying here, just book it. You will not regret it.",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,The amazing view was only the start,"I was hooked in by the photos on YSC’s website, so booked myself and the blond in for two full days of safari. It was a big investment, but worth every penny: this was one of the best experiences of our lives.

Ravi is the consummate host and made us feel extremely welcome from the start. He and his team couldn’t do enough for us. Our ‘tent’ was large and comfortable; our sleep was only ever interrupted by birdsong or the gentle sound of raindrops hitting the roof.

Meals are served on a terrace with A VIEW: an uninterrupted panorama of Yala National Park. Eating dinner there by candle- and moonlight was extraordinary; we’ll remember it forever. Even without the view, the food was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Chamith, the chef, is young but already a culinary genius! We’ll never forget the incredible lunch he cooked us on our first day.

The icing on the cake was the two full days of safari we had at Yala. We had amazing sightings of so many birds and animals. While seeing five leopards was definitely a highlight, we were blown away by unexpectedly seeing an elephant family, two sloth bears, a beautiful jackal and some hilarious water buffalo. All this was made possible by our fantastic guide, Lappé (full name Lakmal). With nine years’ experience, he knew where to take us for off-the-beaten-track wildlife encounters, and his friendly network of fellow guides meant he could keep in touch with sightings around the park. He has an unparalleled knowledge of the fauna in Yala and we learnt so much from him. Ask for him in person - you won’t be disappointed!

I’m running out of adjectives to endorse YSC, so will just say: go!",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Amazing experience,"Our stay at Yala Safari Camping was amazing. From the moment we arrived the staff were attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Mahesh and Lakmal took us on a full day safari and they worked hard to make it an amazing experience for us, including making lunch arrangements and ensuring we were in the best positions for animal sightings. We saw leopards, elephants, buffalo, bears and lots of birds and other animal life. I would recommend a stay here if you would like to experience Yala. Safari cost was USD$100pp for a half day, and $350 for a full day (2 people).",Friends
,Yala Safari Camping,1,"Avoid at All Costs – A Deceptive, Money-Grabbing Scam!","If I could give this place zero stars, I sadly probably would. This was, without a doubt, one of the most misleading, money-hungry establishments I have been to. If you’re considering booking this so-called “luxury” camp, I would honestly strongly encourage you look elsewhere.

Deceptive “All-Inclusive” That’s Anything But!

The first sign that we had been completely misled came at check-in when we were blindsided with the fact that the safari – the entire reason we booked this stay – was not actually included in our all inclusive booking. Despite the booking site clearly advertising “luxury camping with safari all inclusive,” the staff denied any responsibility for this and attempted to charge us an extortionate £100 per person for a HALF-DAY safari. We argued with not one but two managers for what felt like an eternity, only to be met with dismissiveness, a reluctance to do anything and an insistence that we should “read their glowing reviews.” When reading the reviews as they asked us to, we actually laughed off the few critical ones, thinking we hadn’t made a single mistake at all. After all, our booking explicitly stated all-inclusive with safari and restaurant but this was just a blatant lie. But by the time you’re standing there at check-in, bags in hand, with no other plans and limited options, you are left with little to no choice in the matter.

Instead, a Cheap, Unsafe, and Time-Wasting Safari Alternative!

After refusing to pay the extortionate add on rates for the safari which was sold as included, they begrudgingly offered to book us an external safari for half the price. We thought, “Well, at least we’ll still get to go.” Big mistake. The third-party tour was really not great - a sweet guide sure but also a beat-up, seatbelt-less jeep that bounced us around to no end. Instead of heading straight to the reserve, we were taken into town multiple times (once at 6AM) to pick up and drop off strangers, wasting precious safari time. Meanwhile, we later learned that two other guests had also been misled at check-in, but instead of being given the same option as us, they were pressured into paying the full price for the hotel safari option. They ended up on a completely different tour (albeit MUCH better than ours - we saw all the photos at breakfast - wish we didn’t) making it obvious to me that this was a calculated scheme to divide and extract as much money as possible from unsuspecting guests. We felt like second class guests after this and the hotel did everything possible to keep us separate - probably so we couldn’t discuss this with each other. Gutted really as there is usually strength in numbers.

We essentially paid £500 for two nights in a tent and no safari. It was just so very sad for what could have truly been amazing place and experience. Extortionate compared to the rest of Sri Lanka.

To top it all off, after being hit with the safari scam at check-in, they tried to distract us with a grand lunch presentation. And for a brief moment, we were able to shake off the disappointment, because right after lunch, my boyfriend proposed. It was a beautiful moment, until, within 30 seconds of saying yes, the manager marched over, card machine in hand, shoving the invoice at us without so much as a congratulations. They clearly didn’t want to give us a second to rethink or challenge the charges or change our minds on whether we wanted to stay or not. It all felt so calculated.

To think that after all of this we were still put on a worse safari than other guests (because they paid the ransom!!) was so disheartening. Why we couldn’t have gone together at a reduced price I don’t know. I felt like a blacklisted guest after this and it really affected our stay. I would honestly avoid this place at all costs. We feel so very sad and frustrated.",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,5,Incredible experience,"Great experience. Fantastic team, all of whom went above and beyond to give us a memorable stay. Tents were amazing. The vehicles they used were modern meaning we didn't get stuck in the mud, unlike other trucks we saw. The guide was incredibly knowledgeable and could spot wild life a mile off. Because there were 3 trucks and guides in the team they were able to split up and phone each other to share sightings. This led to some exciting dashes down the tracks to see the animals.  
The team at the camp were also excellent and extremely attentive without being invasive",Couples

,Yala Safari Camping,5,A stay at YSC Beyond Expectations !,"Our 3-night stay at Yala Safari Camp was nothing short of extraordinary.

The accommodations were impeccably clean and wonderfully comfortable, offering the perfect balance between wilderness immersion and modern comfort. Manager Ravi went above and beyond, attending to our every need with warmth and precision, making us feel truly cared for throughout our stay.

The dining experience, masterfully crafted by Chef Promod, was a highlight in itself. Each meal was a culinary masterpiece, showcasing exquisite flavors and variety. That being said, there was an abundance of food—perhaps a touch more than necessary—but the quality and creativity were truly outstanding.

The pinnacle of our trip, however, was the safari experience guided by the incredibly knowledgeable and passionate Achi (more than 14 years of experience). His expertise, enthusiasm, and keen eye for spotting wildlife made each safari adventure both thrilling and educational.

The food was a lovely mix of Sri Lankan and western food cooked beautifully and I would defy anyone to go hungry as the plates just keep coming.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,An unforgettable safari experience!,"A truly amazing and memorable experience! We had the luxury of staying at Yala Safari Camping for 2 nights and it didn’t disappoint.
From the moment we were collected from the meeting point as organised, our hosts couldn’t have done more to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. They were especially brilliant with our 2 young children, aged 7 and 4 - big shout out to Chamith who the kids adored! 
We were welcomed with a delicious Sri Lankan lunch, prepared by the chef Promod- probably the best meal we had during our whole trip to Sri Lanka! 
After a quick freshen up in our luxury glamping tent (with a massive bed and bath in the floor), we met with our driver Piumal who took us to zone 5 for an evening safari. Piumal was also our guide for day 2 in zone 1 and was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable, friendly and really cared that we had a great experience and that we saw as much wildlife as possible, he got excited too when we found the animals, which was lovely to see! Piumal guided us to successfully see Elephants, spotted deer, water buffalo, mongeese, wild boar, crocodiles, peacocks, monitor lizards, eagles, storks, monkeys, 2 leopards and even the elusive sloth bear which we were told was a very rare sighting. We couldn’t have asked for more! 
Each evening, we were treated to a candlelit meal served up in the tree tops with great service provided by Ravi, Chamara, Sagara and Chamith. 
On our final morning with the team at Yala we were driven by Chamith to the ancient temple, around 1 hour from the campsite. If you get the opportunity it is well worth a visit. A beautiful place which is very peaceful and one which has the opportunity to climb to the top of a very large rock and experience stunning views of the whole of Yala National Park. 
Our visit to Yala Safari Camping was the highlight of our visit to Sri Lanka and I would recommend it to anyone wanting an authentic, safari experience with a hint of luxury. 
Thank you!",Family

It feels like the last word in Safari experiences. Ravi - who will make you feel like it's your own home, Promod the chef will show you the real meaning of taste. Chamara, Sagara, Madawa, Chamith and Pumal all helped us have the best time. We're grateful and would come back in a heartbeat. We saw: five elephants, many mongoose, a festival of flying things including painted stork, Indian darters, kites, 3 species of beeeaters, black and red faced monkeys, lizards, newts, kingfishers, bulbuls, green pigeons, spotted deer, butterflies water buffalo and too many leopards to count (unfortunately they were all dressed, convincingly as peacocks -it must've been a themed party).",Couples
,Yala Safari Camping,1,Disappointing and Unsafe Experience at Yala Safari Camping - Not beyond expectations!,"Disappointing and Unsafe Experience at Yala Safari Camping

Our experience with Yala Safari Camping was far from what we expected. The trip was dominated by excessive and unsafe driving rather than actual time in nature.

We spent hours driving on main roads in an open jeep without seat belts, which felt extremely unsafe. At one point, our driver was even stopped by the police.
Inside Sector 5, two jeeps crashed into each other due to reckless driving. Instead of continuing the safari, we were left waiting with six adults and six children while the drivers debated a broken taillight for 40 minutes.
After this, we endured another hour on the highway back to camp, meaning our supposedly grand dinner was significantly delayed.
After spending so much time covered in dust, diesel fumes, and sunscreen, none of the guests had time to use the spa or even take a shower before dinner.
The park itself felt highly staged—a tourist circus rather than a true wildlife experience. The leopard appeared exactly at 6:00 PM, well-fed and surrounded by jeeps waiting in position. It felt orchestrated rather than natural.

On the second day, we were misled into choosing a bird-watching tour, which we assumed would be inside the national park. Instead, we were taken to a local lake, spending yet another hour in a jeep without seat belts each way. Yala Safari Camping saved money by skipping the national park entrance fee, which we had already paid for.

The boat tour at the lake was also disappointing—cheap plastic boats with polluting gasoline engines that left us surrounded by toxic fumes. Everyone had a headache from the exhaust while we sat still to observe birds.
When we raised these concerns, Yala Safari Camping assured us that the owner would contact us. That never happened.
To make matters worse, we discovered that the bird-watching trip actually costs $200 (already overpriced), not $450, which we had paid.

Final Verdict
This place lacks safety, professionalism, and transparency. The jeeps are not safe, and too much time is wasted driving rather than enjoying nature. Do not pay upfront—once they have your money, communication shuts down.

We will not return unless this was some massive misunderstanding. The site also appears to be under construction.

Would not recommend.",Family
,Yala Safari Camping,1,Unsafe and misleading experience,"Avoid at all costs – Unsafe and misleading experience!  

First and foremost, none of their Jeeps have seatbelts. This is completely unacceptable, especially considering the reckless driving. We were speeding at a minimum of 60-80 km/h on public roads, spending at least three hours of our “safari experience” just enduring this dangerous ride. To make matters worse, our driver was using his phone on social media while driving. The whole experience felt extremely unsafe, particularly with children in the car—one sudden stop could have had devastating consequences. It’s outrageous that they have chosen to cut costs on basic safety at the risk of their guests’ lives.  

On top of that, we feel completely misled regarding the actual safari experience. After dinner, we were offered the option of a bird safari instead of the planned morning safari in Block 1, as we were told that Block 1 would be overcrowded. We chose the bird safari under the clear impression that it was still a safari experience. At no point were we informed that this would take place outside the national park, in a residential area, an hour’s drive away. While the birds were beautiful, this was not the experience we had signed up for. The whole point of booking a glamping safari was to be in nature, not driving out of the park and into a village!  

Additionally, we were never informed of the significant price difference. We had paid $450  for a proper safari inside the park, but later discovered that the bird safari only costs $200. As a group of 12 people, this meant the company pocketed a huge sum by subtly steering us towards the cheaper alternative without being transparent about what we were actually getting.  

Despite multiple follow-ups, our complaints have been completely ignored. Do not pay in advance! Pay only after the tour, so you don’t end up paying for something you never received.  

We were thoroughly deceived and left with a disappointing and unsafe experience.  

We cannot recommend Yala Safari Camping at all!",Family

Nuwara Eliya,Jetwing St. Andrew's,3,Trading on the past.,"Having had a fine stay at Jeywings Lagoon we were looking forward to St Andrews greatly, disappointment is generally the offspring of  expectation.  Playing up on this hotel’s colonial past comes across a bit artificial to my measure.  Like a theme bar.  
We did enjoy our room, the gardens, lounge rooms. Staff kind. Building is historically interesting. We had a lunch in the garden which was charming. No pool is a tragedy (I understand there are future plans).",Couples
Nuwara Eliya,Jetwing St. Andrew's,5,Very colonial,"We stayed at quite a few Jetwing and can't fault them.  This one was very colonial with lovely rooms and the grounds are quite spectacular, very British in design.  The one fault was with the a la carte menu. We should have stuck with the buffet as the food was slightly under par for a Jetwing, but they made up for it the next morning with a fantastic breakfast",Family

A good sense of security within the resort.

The pool was huge and lounge chairs were easily available. Easy access to the beach smack in the middle of Pasikuda Beach.

Room for improvement -> perhaps add a bar & snack service closer to the beach. Otherwise guests are tempted to walk to other resorts nearby.",Family

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Nice family-owned place,"My first impression of this hotel was that it is a bit odd because of the layout. The building has an old part and a new part, which means that you have to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the elevator, and the rooms did not have exterior facing windows. Rooms had interior ‘courtyard’ windows or no windows. We showed up without a reservation and were fortunate that they had a room available (I don’t recommend doing that). It was significantly more expensive than other places we had been staying ($54 USD compared to the $20-$40 USD range for our other hotels) and it was also much nicer. Of all the places we stayed in Sri Lanka, Sevana had the most comfortable beds with the best pillows and the best linens (they were basically Sri Lankan made Frette linen). I had the best night’s sleep here – quiet and comfy, which is striking since it is on a very busy and very noisy street right downtown. The room had a television (our first in Sri Lanka), electric kettle, toiletries, WiFi, and a small refrigerator. There was no safe, but the building is gated at night and felt extremely safe. I really liked the roof top pool, and it was bigger than I thought it would be (still small but I expected tiny). There is a shower next to the pool, which I am pretty sure no one uses to rinse off because there was a fair amount of sunscreen on the surface of the water – guests should do better. There is a seating area for smokers that also serves as a mosquito haven at night. I was not impressed with the food at the restaurant, fairly limited and not much flavor. I liked the chicken soup the best. However, their server Ruwani Piyumika was awesome. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and obviously a very hard worker. The hotel is lucky to have her. The hotel is an easy walking distance to the bus station, central market, lake, mall, and the temple. The central location also means that there are a lot of vagrants in the general area, but it did not feel unsafe. Everything in Kandy shuts down around 9 or 10 so you are in the hotel anyway. This hotel may not have the panoramic views that you get from the hotels on the hillsides, but you also can get around on your own without climbing those hills or taking a tuk tuk and that’s a good thing since traffic is bad in Kandy. Tip: if you want to rent a scooter, there are only five rental places, and you need a reservation. Totally worth it if you do.",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Good budget hotel,"Pros 

- Central location, easily accessible to all major sights in Kandy. 

- Staff were very helpful and friendly. Check in/out was quick and easy. 

- Room was large - we were given a free upgrade. Despite hotel being on a busy road are room was at the back so we heard no noise. 

- Good price. It’s a budget hotel.

Cons 

- The swimming pool was dirty. 

- Many of the items on the restaurant menu needed pre ordering the day before.",Couples

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,"Convenient stay, cheap price","It has to be said that Sevana City is very much a budget hotel, and is somewhere you would stay for the location rather than the comfort. It's on a busy road, so not exactly serene, but it's a really short walk from all of the nicest bars and restaurants in Kandy, and the Temple isn't too far either. The staff are very friendly and provided a laundry service, while the pool on the roof offers a nice chance to cool down after a day sightseeing. The air-conditioning in our room wasn't working properly however, so we had to rely on the fan so was a little stuffy at times. Given we were only staying briefly we didn't ask to move rooms, but we're sure they would've accommodated us if we had. But for the price you pay, this is a good little place.",None

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Good Hotel with nice view in the center,The staff was very friendly and the room was clean. But there was a bad smell coming from the aircon. The pool was nice and clean. The food in the restaurant was too expensive. We would stay here again but not for the food.,Couples
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Ideal location,"We only stayed one night here after getting a taxi from Habarana. We were then getting the train the next day to Nuwara Eliya so wanted a hotel close to the station. This was ideally placed. Kandy is a busy city and the hotel is on the main road however the room was quiet. It was quite small but perhaps to be expected for a city hotel. It had everything we needed for a quick stopover. We walked to both the Temple of the Tooth and Kandy Lake. Breakfast was good, good choice and the restaurant has a view over Kandy. Excellent service. The staff also went to the trouble of getting us a cheaper tuk-tuk through the app which was very helpful.",Couples
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,"Very good rooms and beds, central position.","What we liked was the high quality of the room: very good beds, good airco, large room, splendid bathroom. We had the most luxury room of the lot, still at a reasonable price.
Location has two sides: the street is unattractive and very noisy, but the rooms have good soundisolation. On the other hand, its very central so you can easily walk around.

The location is very good and is a short walk to most places or a cheap tuk tuk ride.  The staff were very friendly, professional and obliging.  The breakfast is great and there is a nice little pool area.  A thing to note is that you can not purchase alcohol here but there was a liquor store a few blocks away.  The only funny thing is that the lift stops and starts on the 2nd floor so you have to walk up and down a couple of flights of stairs to reception.  This was not an issue at all for us but it may be for some. Recommended.",None

I said don't shout on us but he kept screaming on us made me and my parents embraced. I told him if you keep behaving like this I have to make a complain then he replied you can complain to anyone and he doesn't care!

This is unbelievable!!!! Is this 05 star standard?? Is this ITC standard??? I spoke to duty manager Asanka that time itself and he update me that he took an action against him but the point is, is this the way how ITC staff is trained to treat the guest?

I don’t usually write reviews, and I certainly don’t believe in writing negative ones—but whenever I experience something genuinely good, I always make it a point to appreciate it.

Recently, I had a reservation handled by a wonderful lady named Vidu from the ITC reservation team. What started off with a small misunderstanding could have easily gone downhill. But Vidu stepped in with such grace, professionalism, and empathy that it completely turned the situation around.

She didn’t just clear the confusion—she made me feel heard and respected. The way she calmly explained things and turned what could’ve been a frustrating experience into a pleasant one was nothing short of impressive. It’s rare to come across someone who combines competence with such warmth and emotional intelligence.

People like Vidu truly deserve recognition. She’s a shining example of what hospitality should feel like. Kudos to her—and to ITC—for nurturing such talent. It’s people like her who make a lasting impression.",Family

Wattala,Pegasus Reef Hotel,4,An enduring venue,"Spent two days at a training program and found it had maintained standards experienced more than 25 years ago.  The conference facilities and accommodation is spacious but facilities in the public areas need to be updated as they feel aged. The staff were hospitable and competent, and there was a good selection of cuisine at mealtimes, with well prepared and tasty dishes, with attentive service.  Sahani at the reception was excellent in making guests feel welcome and made it a memorable experience.
Suggestions for improvement: Conference facilities need better illumination, with different options available for different users.
Accommodation: the refillable shower and bath products are environmentally friendly, but from a personal point of view I had no guarantee that they were fit for use as the containers were not sealed.  There was no assurance that these were not the same items used by a previous guests, just topped up.  I used my own products. Providing smaller reusable containers that can be refilled and sealed for each guest would be a better option.",Business

Perched up on a hill in a seemingly forever journey is Skyloft, Kandy. We were transported up the hill in a minivan (because, please trust me on this one, no actual bus can fit!!) on this zigzagging road & eventually arrived at our destination! The views from the hotel are spectacular! As the name suggests, it is situated waaaaaay up the mountain & you have a view right over the city & surrounding hills. Just a beautiful view and magical sunset. The drinks & meals for a tad on the pricey side, but to be honest, we found Sri Lanka quite expensive in general. The rooms were a good size, beds comfortable & the balcony very welcoming to sit & look out over the mountains. We were only here for 1 night & it was quite pleasant.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,"Your very own ‘I’m a Celebrity, Get me out of here!’  Experience, but make it bougie","We did the 2 night stay in February and from start to finish the experience was fantastic. From the excitement of the first jeep ride where we were picked up from the main road by Puma for our (bumpy!) ride down to the camp, where we were met by staff who took our bags & showed us to our huge, air conditioned tent. The curry that we had for lunch on the first day was incredible and the staff are all so lovely - attentive without being intrusive. The lounge area is a calm, beautiful area that is nice to hang out in and watch the squirrels playing and the trees swaying in the breeze. We did an evening safari on the first night, guided by Puma where we were lucky enough to spot all kinds of different animals. Back to the camp for dinner, which was cooked over a huge flame right in front of us. We did a full day Safari the next day with Achi as our guide who was brilliant, very knowledgeable about the animals and the best places to spot them. 
A special mention to all of the staff who made our stay so enjoyable - Ravi, Achi, Puma, Promod, Chamith, Chamara, Sagara & Madawa.
I’d recommend Yala Safari Camping to anyone who wants a mix of relaxation & Safari while in Sri Lanka",Couples

,Yala Safari Camping,5,Glamping at its best!,"We enquired about our stay at Yala Safari Camping only the day before so we knew it was a long shot! We wanted to stay overnight because it was our 20th wedding anniversary. We initially spoke to the owner Manesh, who was incredibly helpful and wanted us to have a great experience. Yala Safari Camping was fully booked when we called so he was going to arrange for us to take advantage of the facilities, food, drinks and safaris, but stay somewhere else. As luck would have it when we arrived and were greeted by the wonderful Manager Ravi, by the time he escorted us into Yala Safari Camping, he had made some rearrangements and we got a room!

The whole experience and service at Yala Safari Camping is five star, nothing was too difficult and we were treated wonderfully. From the owner, to Ravi the Manager, our fabulous waiter Aveen, the cheffing team of Promod & Chamith, to our safari driver Sharan, we had an incredible experience. The food was the best that I have eaten in Sri Lanka and Aveen arranged for us to talk with the chef and learn about the ingredients. This was a real pampering experience and well worth adding this into our trip. It was a highlight for us and we definitely recommend.",Couples

We were taken care of by Aveen who was incredibly attentive and helped to make our stay memorable.

,Yala Safari Camping,5,The best sunset I've ever seen in my life at Yala Safari Camping,"From start to finish, my two-night stay at Yala Safari Camping was nothing short of exceptional.

The accommodation is only accessible by jeep. We were met at the entrance to the park, with our luggage hauled onto the open-air vehicle, and then driven to the lobby. Getting there is a journey in itself!

Yala Safari Camping is a sprawling property, and it's easy to get lost moving between the lobby and the tent. Thankfully, staff were always on hand to look after me, walking me to my tent with a flashlight at night (it's a rocky walk!), ensuring my outside lights were off and tent was zipped up tightly to avoid unwanted visitors, and grabbing me in the morning for an early safari tour.

We made the mistake of pre-booking a half-day safari with an external company, not realising that guests of Yala Safari Camping receive a half-day safari included with their stay.

Meals are also included (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and each meal was an absolute feast! Dinner was barbecued meat, and lunch was seafood - you won't go hungry here. A packed breakfast was provided for the morning safari. 

My glamping tent came with a spa bath - the perfect way to spend a relaxing afternoon among nature. 

Every single staff member made my stay at Yala Safari Camping memorable. A special mention to Achintha, Ravi, Madava, Chamith, Sadaruvan, Suranga and the chef, Pranood, for the warm hospitality.

Keep in mind that accessibility may be limited for some of the tents (steep, rocky terrain walking to and from, plus a few stairs leading to the patio.) I certainly got a daily workout in, but it's worth it for such a wonderful stay!",Business

Colombo,Colombo Court Hotel & Spa,5,"Excellent experience, gorgeous room","After a 2 week tour of Sri Lanka, I had an extra night in Colombo by myself. As it was only one night I wasn’t fussed about where the agent booked so I didn’t even google before arriving at Colombo Court. 
This place is spectacular when you know what you’re getting, imagine my delight when I’d been expecting a room with bed. 

 Vihan, Hanfal and Mark met us at reception and provided exemplary service. I received a free room upgrade and squealed with delight upon seeing the canopy bed, ginormous bath and the wrap around balcony. It was all stunning. 

The pool is gorgeous and the rooftop bar has been done to a really high spec. The whole experience felt like we’d stepped into a hidden oasis in the middle of the bustling noise of Colombo. 

The menu was also excellent. Benefit of being a city, they have figured out how to do breakfast pastries properly. This is notable because all the local breads we’d had to date, all tended to be on the sweet side (no matter if there is fish or onion within).

I did get whacked with an unexpected and sizeable government tax/service charge on some wine which was almost 25% of the total bill. This hasn’t happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka so it was a bit of a shock (10% service charge was the norm in the more built up touristy areas). But hey ho. The room and facilities are what I’ll be remembering for a long time to come.",Solo

Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,A Perfect Retreat at Riff Hikkaduwa: Exceptional Hospitality and Delicious Cuisine,"We visited Riff Hikkaduwa last month for our honeymoon and loved the experience so much that we decided to bring our parents this month to enjoy the same. From the moment we arrived, we received a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm and peaceful. One of the best parts of our stay was the hotel's beachfront location, providing us with stunning views and easy access to the beach.

The food was absolutely delicious. In fact, our return trip was largely motivated by the warm hospitality and fantastic cuisine. Everyone in our group enjoyed the meals, especially the biriyani, which was incredibly flavorful and generously filled with chicken pieces and cashews. We were even able to thank the chef personally for making the best biriyani we've ever had.

Special mention goes to the waitress, Benisha. She remembered us from our previous visit and was extremely helpful, always suggesting the best dishes for us to try and doing so with a big smile. She made our dining experience even more enjoyable. Additionally, since my mother is a vegetarian, Benisha provided her with a full board menu featuring a variety of vegetarian dishes, which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

The location, the staff, the views and the understated beauty of the hotel made for a special few days. We could happily have stayed longer. You have the best of both worlds, an enormous pool (that you can swim lengths in, hoorah!) and beach access just 4 steps away. Simply stunning. 

A special thank you to Theekshana who was so beautifully accommodating of our daughter and couldn't do enough to care and tailor our experience from the time we arrived until our check out.",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,A surprising stay!,"It was a wonderful stay in Riff Hikkaduwa, amazing beach view at the room with a spacious balcony, the room design is very modern.
What is most impressive is their restaurants - didn’t expect we could have such decent quality of Japanese food at their rooftop Japanese restaurants. The breakfast sets served at their G/F restaurant were amazingly delicious and fruitful.
Our stay wouldn’t be that wonderful without all the very warm and helpful staff - they also gave us a very decent tea gift when we were departing. Definitely a worth stay!",Family
Hikkaduwa,Riff Hikkaduwa,5,Riff Hikkaduwa food experience,"I recently stayed at Riff Hikkaduwa and was thoroughly impressed. The food was exceptional, with each dish artistically arranged. The uncommon flavour combinations were a delightful surprise, making each meal a unique culinary adventure featuring combinations that were truly memorable and totally worth the price u pay for. The service was top-notch, with the entire hotel staff going above and beyond to ensure a fantastic experience. Highly recommend!",Family

The rooms offer gorgeous views, the staff is phenomenal, the food is amazing, and the overall atmosphere is fantastic. The soulful people who work here truly enhance the experience. I left this place with a full heart due to the connections I made with the people here. I experienced so much love and generosity.

I really can't thank Shaa enough and all the wonderful people who crossed my path here. Finally, I want to thank the staff and management for all the gifts they gave me to take home.

So much love for this place.

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Convenient location and comfy beds!,"Checked in at 11pm due to a flight delay. The hotel is very unassuming especially at that time of night, however on arrival, we were warmly welcomed and even upgraded! The hotel is much larger than you would expect. Our room had two large double bed and a modern bathroom. It was very clean and quiet. We both had a great nights sleep and it was exactly what we needed for our first night in Sri Lanka.",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,3,Okay for short-stay,"Pros - near train station, reasonably priced, rooftop plunge pool & central to Kandy attractions i.e. lake, temple of sacred tooth etc.
Cons - hotel is a bit of a jumble (built up over time), small room, facilities ok..
Its a reasonable 3 star, short stop hotel.",Couples

The breakfast and food was lovely on the 7th floor. The pool has a lovely view from it.

Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Service beyond the extra mile,We couldn't get train tickets online to Ella and our local tour agent also could not get it. Mr Udara was very helpful and found us a train towards Ella from Gampola instead (about 45mins from Kandy). His staff also went out of their way to help obtain the tickets so we could experience one of the world's most scenic train rides. Kudos to the team at Sevana City Hotel!,None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Excellent!,"This place is a gem! First it has a great location close to the train station, Temple of the Tooth, market etc. The rooms are super clean and quite modern with bottled water and snacks as an extra. The restaurant was excellent and the pool on the roof lovely. What we most loved though were the increíble staff who were so genuine, friendly and accommodating, they were second to none! 

Only downside was the Wifi which varied depending on where you are in the building. I also would like to see them add a service charge to the menu so their great servers are guaranteed a tip.

We loved our stay and would stay again if we could. Highly recommend!",Friends
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Great place to stay!,"We stayed in 2 twin rooms in November. This is a great very centrally located hotel, with a weird layout but nice rooms. Our room faced the street and we loved the beautiful sunrises (its ok there are blinds) and distant calls to prayer in the morning. However we thought management were joking when we saw the note about not leaving the door open as ""monkeys may come in"". Nope! We were treated to a monkey family having some down time on our balcony most mornings - it was fantastic.
Also the pool on the roof is great, and the breakfasts are worth it!",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Very decent hotel,"We visited this hotel just for one night. A nice surprise was an upgrade to a Delux room.

All in all a good place to stay.",Couples

Also, the hotel was a 10 minute walk to the lake and the Sri Dalada Maligawa.  When we come back we will stay here again!",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Amongst the best Hotels i have stayed in,"Rooms were very neat and large, furnished almost as good as a 5 Star room. Bathroom was clean and excellent. The only thing missing was a safe, but everything else upto most minor luxuries were in this room which had a Budget tariff. Room service was great . 

The rest of the Hotel was very tastefully done, the management and junior staff was extremely helpful, and it was a pleasure to stay here.

Location of the Hotel was in the centre of everything.  Maybe the exteriors are not so good, but thats because of the busy location. But once your in the Hotel, its lika an oasis. If Sevana were to have charged double the price, I would have still given it an excellent review",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,3,Good Wifi and comfortable rooms. Otherwise a bit random. Pricey restaurant.,"On first impression (arriving), the outside doesnt seem appealing. Also the entry (lobby area) is a bit unusual. There is a kitchen and sitting area and the whole section is a little dark, basic and not a very welcoming feel. We booked a deluxe room and was hoping the rooms were better than the initial impression of the hotel. In fact it was a nice surprise of how modern and high quality the room was. There is a bit of a musty/damp smell, when first get into the room. Otherwise the room was spacious, modern furnishings and the bathroom (large) was updated and good quality. Really nice steam shower also. Pool area has hardly any seating at all. Enough for maybe 3 or 4 people. 
Staff very friendly and helpful throughout the stay.  I gave a 3 out of 5 review because of the slight musty smell in the room, the lobby area and also the fact that the restraunt so so expensive. I was shocked to see that for dinner, the kotthu was 1200LKR! ($7). This to me is not acceptable at this class/level of hotel. Max you pay for this in a local place, is 400LKR. Breakfast also is $5. Dont understand these prices, when its not a fancy hotel. Wifi was very good the whole time we were there, which was nice to have. I'd suggest booking a better room, as the deluxe seemed much nicer than some of the other rooms that I saw (which i walked past and door was open). Not a bad choice for the price, but it's not the most appealing to the eye.",Couples
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,5,Great location amid of Kandy,"Me any my girlfriend stayed at this place in November. The location amid of Kandy was great for us to have a walk in the evening. The staff were super friendly. I was impressed how the man on the reception carried our heavy luggage two floors up, since there was no elevator to our room. Striding by the reception, we felt as passing a living room of a Sri Lanki home. We were then told, that it started as a small guest house and now it is extended to a hotel with about 20 rooms. This is unique. The view from the rooftop pool is impressive. The breakfast in the morning, which costs 5 dollars was one of the best breakfasts we had. The room was big and clean. We can recommend this place for a stay in Kandy.",None
Kandy,Sevana City Hotel,4,Great simple hotel,"This little family run dream, turned into the modern hotel it is today is perfect for the 1-3 night traveller. We were given an upgrade on arrival, which is always nice. It’s location is great, right in the middle of everything you would want to see and walking distance to all. Train station only a 5 min walk away too!

The rooms were nice and clean, plenty of common areas to sit and read! Wifi was ordinary - but we didn’t really need. The rooftop pool and restaurant was the cherry on top!!",Couples

Kandy,Skyloft Kandy By Aaradhya,2,Poor experience especially where food is concerned .,"Stayed one night whilst touring. Beautiful setting up in the mountains. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Bathroom very small and cold. Arrived early afternoon shown to our room and told we could purchase something to eat up on the 3rd floor bar/restaurant. We ordered a pizza which took nearly half an hour to arrive only to find it was still frozen in the middle so refused it. Dinner that evening was a set meal with us being on the half board plan, again taken in the same restaurant. For service was slow. The order was wrong for my husband so he had to wait for a fresh dish to be cooked whilst I ate mine. The food was not at all hot (chicken and rice). On our exist of the restaurant food was being brought up from the kitchens in the guest lift uncovered, this is a very poor habit   Needless to say that I spent the majority of the night in the bathroom being very ill. Abdominal cramps and unable to even hold down sips of water. This was due to the temperature of my food. We had to delay our departure 3 hours before I could manage to walk to the car as so poorly. Husbands meal was fine and he also enjoyed the breakfast.",Couples

Wattala,Pegasus Reef Hotel,1,Avoid This Hotel – NOT for Western/European Travelers!,"This hotel is strictly tailored for non-Western guests, and we urge international travelers to look elsewhere. Despite meticulously choosing it based on thousands of glowing reviews, we were severely disappointed upon arrival.

Key Issues:

- Misleading ""Luxury"" Claims – Far below international standards in hygiene, upkeep, and comfort. ""Outdated"" is an understatement.
- Unacceptable Hygiene – Best not to discuss; you’ll only regret it.
- Food Fiasco – Don’t be fooled by photos! Every savory dish is drenched in chili—except desserts. Even basic, neutral options (pasta, rice, eggs) were inedible for those unaccustomed to extreme spice.

Overrated & Overpriced – At best, a 2-star experience masquerading as premium.

Final Verdict: If you’re not from a culture where chili-heavy food and lax hygiene are the norm, steer clear. A textbook example of why you can’t trust local ratings blindly.",Family

Wattala,Pegasus Reef Hotel,4,A Decent Stay Near Colombo - Good for a Night or Two,"We stayed at Pegasus Reef for a night, mainly for its location not too far from Colombo and the airport. The hotel has a calm, open feel with a spacious garden and a nice pool area by the sea, which was a lovely spot to unwind after a long journey.

Rooms were clean and spacious, though a bit outdated in design. The bed was comfortable, but the AC was a little loud. The staff were helpful, especially at check-in, and they even managed to accommodate a last-minute request with no fuss. Room service was quick and portions were generous.

However, the food could be better. The buffet didn’t quite match the standard you'd expect for the price, and some dishes lacked flavor. Also, the beach is not really swimmable, more for views than beach lounging.

If you're just looking for a comfortable place to relax near the airport or Colombo, it's a decent pick. But if you're expecting a resort-style beachfront experience or top-tier dining, you might want to explore other options.",Friends

Pasikuda,Sunrise Pasikuda,5,A nice relaxing stay in Pasikuda,"It was a nice and relaxing stay we had at Sunrise Pasikuda and it was truly amazing. From the point we checked-in, the staff was so friendly and helpful and attentive to guest’s needs. We stayed for 3 nights at the suite and the suite was spacious and comfy. The resort has direct access to private beach and it was the starting of the Pasikuda season so there was no rain and the sea was so quite and calm. The blue sea and the brown beach were like a beautiful painting and the views all around are breathtaking. I suggest visiting during the season though it is bit expensive as then you can have a sunny weather and the best climate to explore the stunning beach and water sports.  
The property has some water sport activities and you can book them as you wish, we did snorkeling and it was amazing, we saw lots of fish and corals too. Talking about the property it claims the longest swimming pool in Pasikuda which is 108m and its beautiful. You can have a swim up and down the pool for a real workout or the gym too is great for that. They have indoor sports like table tennis, pool and board games like chess and carrom. 
I suggest going for the suite if you wish to have a relaxing stay as the suit is spacious with a separate living area, 2 TVs, a bathroom and another washroom, bathtub and a large balcony. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the minibar filled and it’s good if we had that too. 
The restaurant staff were so attentive to guest’s needs and I should specifically mention Kavindu, Amaya, Udara, Anjana, Mahinda (team lead), Imesh (restaurant captain) for their great service. Not forgetting others too. The platters were mouthwatering and the portions sizes are great. We were offered a new dessert the chef has prepared and that was tasty too. Thank you for the tasty platters, the chef and the team. The room service staff is also helpful and kudos to Mr. Ruwan (general manager) and the whole Sunrise Pasikuda team for your amazing hospitality.

I understand the Sri Lankan custom of sheet only (no quilt or blanket) but this meant our options were aircon and freeze or no aircon and swelter. We opted for aircon so we had air movement and we slept in our clothes. Initially we had no fridge although one was brought on request. Perhaps there is only one that is moved around the hotel?

Villa stay

We spent 4 nights at Anantara Kalutara Resort in a villa with a private pool and had an absolutely amazing time! Throughout our stay we were welcomed and taken care of!  At the main entrance four lovely ladies performed a traditional dance, which made for such a warm and memorable first impression.

Our villa had a fresh fruit basket waiting for us, filled with the most delicious tropical fruits, the mini bar was stocked with refreshments and we had a tea and coffee station. The resort itself is stunning, with the river on one side and the beach with its wild waves on the other, such a unique and beautiful setting.

The resort offers a lot of activities , but we especially loved the sundown yoga and a wonderfully relaxing couples massage. The weather was pleasant the entire stay, with just a brief tropical shower that cleared up quickly and only added to the experience.

The attention to detail and the service were truly outstanding. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, welcoming, and incredibly helpful. A special thank you to Ishara Disanayaka, Assistant Guest Relations Manager, and Lashan Liyanage, Front Office Manager. Both Ishara and Lashan, in particular, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying every moment.

Even on the day of our early departure, the team kindly packed us a breakfast to go, such a thoughtful touch!

Our only regret? That we couldn’t stay longer. Sri Lanka we loved visiting your beautiful country.",Friends

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,2,"Gorgeous location, but needs better management!","The rooms boast gorgeous views of the mountains surrounding the town of Kandy.  I had to downgrade this beautiful hotel because of design defects and sloppy management.   The walkways from the guest rooms to the dining room and the front desk areas can be too steep for the elderly or someone suffering from asthma,       Kandy can get cold at night, but there is no provision for heating the room, despite an HVAC unit showing a  ""Heat"" setting and a ""Dry"" setting that were non-functional (as I found out later)!   Consequently, your towels remain damp (ugh) and the shower floor never dries, unless you turn on the AC during the cold weather and wear a winter jacket in the room!    We were only given 2 bath towels (no hand towels or washcloths), but requests for such items fell on deaf ears.   Complaints to management only resulted in apologies, but additional towels were never delivered!  The same was true for in-room tea and coffee supplies.  If you wanted more than one cup of your favorite beverage in your room, you are out of luck.    Breakfast was sub-par for a hotel calling itself a 'luxury' hotel - choices were limited, some dishes were too salty, and the Hopper Station was painfully slow!   I wish the guest room windows had screens so they could be left open to enjoy the cool mountain air.  Unfortunately, opening them only brought in mosquitoes, bugs, and flies.  Screen manufacturers - here is a great niche market for you!",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,Great stay,"We stayed just for one night and although the stay was short, we still thoroughly enjoyed. Staff were welcoming on arrival and friendly and helpful throughout. 

The room and hotel were very clean, and the infinity pool was excellent. The drinks and pool menu I found good and reasonably priced.

Unfortunately dinner and breakfast was not buffet service on our stay, but the set menu offered was still good.",Couples
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,4,Beautiful Views,"The hotel is built on a steep mountainside. There are several two story buildings that partially wind down the mountain. Each building containing three or four rooms. The views are beautiful as you look down from your balcony.

This hotel is definitely not for any person with mobility problems. The trail to your room can be taxing. The restaurant requires you to go up and down stairs.

The room only provides you with a bath towel.  We were putting the bath towel on the floor after using them because the bathroom floors got extremely slippery when wet.

Turned in my laundry early so it would be done by the end of the day. My laundry was still missing at 8:00 pm. Called reception and they said they would look into it. Called again at 8:30 pm. Finally my laundry arrived at 8:45 ,pm.

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,4,A hotel with a spectacular view,"I would rate Fox Kandy's staff service and friendliness as outstanding, exceeding a 5-star rating; however, my assessment of the hotel itself would be closer to 4 stars.  While the room was exceptionally clean, the towel supply was inconsistent.  We received varying numbers of towels each day, even having only one bath towel to share on our last night when the hotel was full.  Additionally, the bed sheets were stained, of poor quality, and pilled, making them uncomfortable and feeling like there were crumbs in the bed. 
I found the food temperature inconsistent, often lukewarm or cold, though this might be a matter of personal preference. (I am fussy and like hot food to be hot; my husband ate the food, ok). The staff were truly lovely and accommodating, and did their best to help me.
The hotel is situated on top of a mountain and takes about 15 minutes from bottom to top. A couple of times, we had to walk the final steep hill because our driver just couldn't get to the top, which was ok for us because we are able bodied. The views from this hotel are truly breathtaking, and the sunset (from the main gate and down the hill little way) are truly amazing.
Thank you to all the staff at Fox Kandy for making us feel so welcome.",Couples
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,4,Breathtaking Rainforest Views,"It was a fair hotel and had breathtaking views, and the room was perfectly clean and nice.

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,"Lovely place, great service!","We booked two rooms at Fox Kandy during Avurudu (12 - 14 April) and it was such a LOVELY experience. The view from the rooms was breathtaking and the food was excellent. I had read many positive reviews about the staff and was not disappointed! Everyone, from the front office (Jude and Senuki) to the restaurant chefs and waiters, and ground staff were so accommodating! We really appreciated the level of care shown to my father (who is 92 years old and has trouble walking). I even wondered where staff had been trained as it’s uncommon to receive such excellent service in other places. My parents also enjoyed playing the piano at the reception area and the Avurudu celebration organised for guests was much appreciated. Thank you for making this trip so memorable 🙏",Family

The food and service at the buffet and Italian restaurant was fantastic. They looked after us an incredible amount. When it rained, a member of staff came out and gave us an umbrella so we didn’t get wet. Our personal butler Wasala was a great chap who helped us a phenomenal amount with needing a late checkout. We took our 4 year old to kids club and their activities were superb where my son had great time and kept saying ‘I want to go back to kids club’ after we left. Nuwani was wonderful with him and made him feel really settled and comfortable. The lifeguards were really friendly and any questions I had, they answered with a smile. I will certainly be staying there the next time we get to visit Sri Lanka. Had a tear in my eye leaving thanks to the blessing we received. Thank you",Family
Kalutara,Anantara Kalutara Resort,4,Presumptuous hotel in lovely surroundings.,"The word ""presumptious"" describes this hotel well.
It's in beautiful surroundings right by a nice beach,but it's so overpriced for what it offers. It's relying upon it's location.
The evening buffet is so overpriced, and the service is not great. 
No atmosphere or Sri Lankan experience feeling at all. For a genuine experience walk up the road to the Red Lobster run by a family and so authentic and reasonably priced. 
We paid quite a premium for a Deluxe Ocean View and had no sea view apart from a little bit over tall palm trees. Please don't waste your money.
When we went to settle the bill at reception it took forever. Definitely not 5* service. They definitely need to up their game. Having stayed in various hotels in Southern India which excelled,  this hotel does not live up to it's expectations.",Couples

A special shout out to the staff in the Olu restaurant. The food was so varied and incredibly delicious. The chefs are so passionate about the food being provided and it was great to learn more about the food from them. Service here was fantastic. What a great team!

We got to know some really great people at the Olu Bar. Suranda, Nipun, Kavithra and Thilina  were fantastic. It was a pleasure chatting with this team. We were really sad to say goodbye, but want to thank them for making our stay so memorable!

Our room was spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully designed with traditional Sri Lankan elements blended beautifully with modern comforts. We especially loved the private balcony overlooking the water and the open-concept bathroom with a luxurious bathtub.

Dining was a highlight of our stay. Each meal was a treat—from fresh seafood at Olu to the delicious international breakfast buffet. The chefs clearly take pride in their craft, and the variety offered meant there was something for every palate.

We also enjoyed the spa and yoga sessions, which added an extra layer of relaxation to our stay. The resort grounds are beautifully maintained, with lush gardens, a quiet beach, and tranquil pool areas perfect for unwinding.

Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, a family holiday, or simply a break from the hustle and bustle, Anantara Kalutara offers an unforgettable experience. We left feeling refreshed, pampered, and already planning our return.

Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,Nice little boutique hotel,"Great view from room out to sea. Decent enough room in this boutique hotel only gripes was the fragrance of their cleaning products which was a bit overpowering and the fact that the bathroom was very dark even with lights on.

Infinity pool was nice as was the sun deck even if sun beds were a little close together for my UK comfort.

Restaurant was small but really nice and the food was exceptional, all being home cooked. The veggie burger and fries was one of the tastiest I have ever eaten. Wish we had been there longer to try the home made ice creams. 

As with all our trip around Sri Lanka, the staff were exceptional.

Location wise, a certain level of fitness would be needed to walk to and from the hotel to the centre due to it being on top of the cliffs. Although the hotel does provide bookable transport to Jungle Beach.",Couples

Only a few rooms, so the atmosphere is intimate and the rooftop/pool is never crowded. In addition to breakfast, we ate at the hotel restaurant several times and really enjoyed the food. The only negative thing is the remote location in a sense that during the dark there was really nowhere you could walk even if you felt like having a stroll.

They didn’t have buffet which they let us know before but the options on the Ala carte menu was also very limited. Instead of the dinner menu we were given the lunch menu as apparently this menu was not available. Additionally there was no kids menu. We went with 2.5 year old and the only option was nuggets and rice. No dessert was offered for the child, we had to pay extra for this. The dessert we requested from the menu was also unavailable so we just had to get ice cream. Breakfast was no better. Chickpeas was served for baked beans. The bacon jam however was really good.

We stayed one night in the Pavilion and two nights at Waves. The rooms at Waves are more modern and the mattress was much more firm so I would recommend booking a room here. That said all the staff were amazing and did everything they could to accommodate our requests and look after us.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by warm, smiling faces at reception. A special mention to Sohani and Sandanu for their wonderful welcome – they truly set the tone for our whole stay.

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home. We stayed in the two-bedroom suite, which was perfect for our family of four. The split-level design made it feel especially spacious and luxurious.

The hotel has been tastefully designed with a serene beach vibe throughout. The main pool is absolutely stunning, offering views out to sea, and the smaller pool provided a peaceful alternative – also with beautiful views.

The location of the hotel was excellent. Just a 10–15 minute walk into town – or a quick tuk-tuk ride if you prefer – it was close enough to be convenient but far enough away to remain peaceful and relaxing.

Breakfast was generous and catered to all tastes, with both Western and Sri Lankan options. We also enjoyed lunch and dinner at the hotel – every meal was delicious and pleased both adults and kids alike.

During our stay, we went on several trips, and we’re especially grateful to Gihan for his fantastic advice on the best places to visit.

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,4,Good Stay in Kandy.,"We found Fox Kandy to be the one hotel which did not quite live up to expectations as much as others. It does indeed have a very impressive view, if you have the right room and is certainly on the top of Kandy. There is a pool which we used in the evening which was a nice temperature. The hotel is difficult to get to for anyone as it's a very tight and sharp road so difficult to eat anywhere but the hotel. The hotel restaurant is good, but feels a little cold in atmosphere and noisy with the fairly common chopping of the Roti for the Kottu Roti. To be fair I actually loved the Kottu Roti which was cooked fresh, so I was ok with it. The standard buffet was good by looks but I ate from the Sri Lankan Pots to eat traditionally which was very good and did so for breakfast also. The room was ok, the bed was as most beds in Sri Lankan hotels quite a decent size and was comfortable. I mark it down because we did not feel like we belonged as we did with other hotels, but we did stay at lots of Boutique hotels. I think Fox Kandy is on the limit between Boutique and a larger hotel and I think that's what makes it feel slightly less personal. The staff did help us out when I left my phone in our drivers car, and we did appreciate that too.",Couples

We stayed two nights on a tour around Sri Lanka and had stayed in much smaller hotels prior to the Fox Candy. Despite the impressive facilities, the overall atmosphere of the hotel feels somewhat impersonal. The service, while polite and professional, lacks the warmth and personal touch that you get from a smaller hotel.
The restaurant is a buffet and can get rather noisy with the clatter of plates.  One of restaurant staff was rather brusque, letting down the others staff somewhat, However the Sri Lankan food section was exceptional for a buffet, a really helpful chef deserving a 5* rating.",Couples

The resort is beautifully situated, offering breathtaking valley views from most rooms, making sunrise a spectacular sight. The cleanliness and upkeep of the property were commendable, adding to the comfort of our stay.

One minor challenge was the approach road, which was difficult to navigate by bus at night. However, during the day, it wasn’t much of an issue.

The resort's pool was a highlight for our family, providing a relaxing and enjoyable time. Breakfast was impressive, especially the Sri Lankan counter, which gave us a wonderful introduction to the local cuisine. However, we felt that dinner could be improved by offering an à la carte option alongside the buffet option.

Big thanks to Navod, Manjula, Hastha and Keerithi who looked after us so well. Don't miss afternoon...... if you can squeeze it in!!!

The staff were so friendly and the service was exceptional. The hotel is in a beautiful setting up in the mountains above Kandy and we were able to easily get down to visit the town and sites.

Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,"Serene, immaculate and welcoming","We are the family of five who it appeare so preoccupied the delightful Katie, see review below. Luckily for us, we did not notice her.

Contrary to her description, we had a blissful time relaxing at W15 (occupying 2 rooms for 4 nights, I expect that's why children are welcome as well as couples who seemed to stay for only 1 or 2 nights only). We would highly recommend the hotel to couples or families. It feels like a home away from home in the most beautiful surroundings.

All the staff were delightful, and very kind to the children. Sherriff and Hastha were always ready to help and arrange wonderful activities. We also appreciated the turn down service and the lovely housekeeping staff.

The hotel has two expert naturalists, Banuka and Anju. We were really impressed by their knowledge and professionalism. They took us on a nature walk and also a hike. They were highly engaging and made the activities lots of fun and interesting for the children who otherwise could have got bored or tired in the heat.

The hotel location is perfect- very close to Kandy for visiting the city and also in the most beautiful and serene setting in the mountains, with spectacular views and immaculately kept grounds.

The design and interiors of the house are also stunning and very comfortable. We loved sitting on the wrap around veranda,  playing board games in the library and lounge, swimming in the pool and playing croquet on the lawn.",Family
Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,"Great, just a couple of minor tweaks would make it perfection in my opinion","The stand out here would be the views and the staff, the staff absolutely cannot do enough for you, and you are made to feel incredibly welcome from start to finish. Our room and the property were beautiful, and the explanation of the excursions and dining was excellent. We were served by Sheriff, Prabod, Hastha and Navod who were wonderful. 

Just a couple of minor things I would change if possible:

- ordering food straight after a meal for the next meal is difficult, I found myself worrying I wasn’t hungry enough etc. I understand the need for this, but I couldn’t face the food I’d ordered for the time we’d requested both evenings and went to bed very full and a little uncomfortable. It would be nice to be able to choose later, or have a more casual approach to this.

- The property isn’t adult only, and in my opinion, should be. A family with 3 children were there when we were, and they were constantly shouting, screaming and running around. The property is very small and intimate, so it isn’t really possible to remove yourself, and it completely spoils the atmosphere. I was loving hearing the natural sounds and watching the view, and swimming in complete bliss. All of this was ruined once the children descended. We were having a lovely morning at the pool, but this was ruined when the family landed and the children were repeatedly jumping in and out, splashing and screaming. We therefore moved to the lawn but would have really liked the option to swim to cool down. Our room had a private part of the veranda which was wonderful and we dined there each evening; however the children kept running past really close to us somewhat spoiling it, and it didn’t feel private with them constantly staring at us. Fortunately a thunder storm came and sent them indoors. The parents seemed on edge the whole time, and I don’t know what was worse, hearing the children or the parents constantly berating them for being children. It would be easier all round if there was an age limit.

That being said, it’s a beautiful property and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Another thanks to the staff who were absolutely incredible.",Couples

Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,Fabulous hotel with amazing team to take care of you. A must stay when visiting Kandy.,"Fabulous 3 night stay at W15. Amazing location with wonderful team taking care of us.

We have just left our stay at W15. Our room, number 2, was large, spotlessly clean with a separate shower and roll top bath, we had our own lounge and French windows opening onto our private garden. 

Nothing was too much trouble for all the team and we were looked after by an amazing team of butlers, Sheriff, Hastha, Prabod and Navod. They were wonderful and we cannot praise them enough. 

To celebrate our wedding anniversary they surprised us with a delicious cake. They also arranged a special dinner with a separate table for two in the garden for us. It was a lovely experience and one we will never forget.

We went out on a wildlife ride in their open top vintage land rover defender.. Our guide was Banuka and he showed us leopard paw prints and claw scratches on trees. He was very informative about the landscape, wildlife and local tea picking. 

Nighttime turn down service included a hot water bottle if you need it. 

We highly recommend the hotel. It is in a peaceful location with a wonderful view and fabulous team.

Kalutara,Anantara Kalutara Resort,2,"Seriously disappointing for an Anantara, multiple problems","This is our fourth different Anantara, which obviously gave us certain reasonable expectations, and only heightened the disappointment.  This is not sabotage by a competitor or the review of some disgruntled ex-employee, please look at my many many other reviews of five star hotels around the world. I have also been for several years a Platinum member of the GHA Discovery loyalty programme of which Anantara is part.  
 
The hotel is on a peninsula by a lagoon so not really a ""beach hotel"" especially with large waves, being on the west coast.  It has the advantage of being relatively close to the airport as the expressway bypasses Colombo city.  
 
For context we stayed six nights, in a pool villa, at over US$1,000 per night for bed and breakfast, which also creates certain reasonable expectations (especially given Sri Lanka is not generally very expensive and this is not in a major city).  
 
Oh dear. Where to start.  
 
Maybe with the arrival. I could not believe the entrance to the hotel.  It could have been a municipal car park. No nice plants or flowers, just a concrete desk in the brutalist style.   And loads of parked cars with no hedge or anything to screen them.  Literally the worst first impression of any hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere in Asia.    
 
They do try, there is a delightful dance by some girls in local costume with drummers to escort you from the car park entrance to the actual reception, which is a nice touch. 
 
Hotels, in general, and including the Anantara, are not very good at appreciating that after a sixteen hour journey door-to-door, guests just want to get to their rooms, not wait around in very hot un-air-conditioned reception areas. You have all my details, the room is paid for, what takes so long?
 
Wine-gate
The next catastrophe was the religious holiday.  We had arrived two days before the local New Year's celebration.  Mea culpa.  I refer again to the 16 hour journey - we were looking forward to relaxing with a drink. However, the host who took us to the room declared that the hotel bars were now shut due to the holiday, and no alcohol was available for THREE DAYS.  Not, I'm afraid, our idea of a holiday. And half of our entire stay at this hotel. Why had they not e-mailed to warn us of this?  The same guy re-confirmed that by Whatsapp that afternoon, none of the restaurants or bars were serving alcohol.  But we could have alcohol delivered and drink it in the room.  So rather than an atmospheric dinner on our first night we had room service.   
 
So to have a drink the next day by our private pool we ordered beers on room service.  To save phoning again and waiting, answering the door again, we ordered four, and put two in the fridge.  Seemingly all good.  Until later when wanting to consume said beers, we discover there is no bottle opener in the suite. So, phone up again.  And wait.  After 20 minutes, phone again.  Two minutes later a bottle opener arrives.   Three minutes later another knock on the door, and a second bottle opener arrives!   
 
Then I realise that the wine we have ordered in advance for the evening (on the basis there is none in the restaurants) has a cork.  And there is no corkscrew in the room.  Sorry, the thousand-bucks-a-night suite. What they have delivered (twice) will only open beer/soda bottles.  So rather than waiting to call until after dinner I phone, again, and ask for a corkscrew, so I will be prepared.  A few minutes later same room service guy, says he has come to open the wine.  I don't want the wine opened now, I want the advanced technology to enable me to open it later that evening after returning from our (dry) dinner.   
 
Poor guy, he says it is his own personal corkscrew, but hands it over to me anyway, bless him.  I told him to go straight back and make the hotel give him a replacement.  I really hope they did. 
 
Went for dinner.  And guess what, they are serving wine, no problem. The embargo on alcohol was only for one night not three. 
 
The Anantara boasts three restaurants.  The main restaurant is an international buffet (you know the type).  It's alright, if that is what you are looking for in a five star experience. And an Italian (more later!). We chose to go to ""Spice Traders"", the Asian option.  The food was actually very good, with table service 'n all. An overall nice experience, more or less what we would expect. So far, so good. 
 
On two of the subsequent evenings we tried to book we were told Spice Traders was closed.  This left the five star hotel with a choice of only two restaurants: a buffet, or an Italian. And we had not really flown ten hours to eat Italian. Unacceptable and absolutely not as promoted.
 
I was really hoping to call out the Italian restaurant, Acquolino as a highlight.  We had lunch there, fresh pizza, which was excellent.  For dinner, I had a seafood risotto which was very very good indeed (fine dining standard). The wife had a good lamb shank, falling off the bone. All lovely.  
 
Sadly the wheels fell off with our final lunch.  I guess we chose badly, but the menu is limited and it was our fourth lunch there.  A terrible lasagne that could have been straight from a (down-market) supermarket and a tagliatelle dish with horrible tomato sauce, bland and far too sweet, seemingly out of a jar.  Such a shame. 
 
Bottled water:  there is definitely a problem with the bottled water supplier, or the Anantara is storing it for too long before use.  Increasingly through the stay, the water provided was off. And yes, water can go off!! It started as the occasional bottle, but by day six seemed to be every bottle we opened smelt of old socks.  We did not encounter this at any of the other four hotels at which we stayed in Sri Lanka.
 
We have stayed in several hotels around the world in rooms with private pools.  And never before have only two outdoor towels been provided. The whole point is you want to use the pool in the morning, before housekeeping comes, with a fresh towel.  You then use that one all day.  So provide four towels.  It does not increase the overall towel consumption at all. You simply start the day with a fresh towel. Pool suite etiquette 101. 
 
Checkout: the reception area is not air-conditioned so is naturally very hot and humid. The only ceiling fans are over on the other side of this area and nowhere near the desks.  The process is slow, and made infuriating by the fact that those behind the desk have standalone desk fans on full blast.  Pointing at the staff (who are accustomed to the heat) rather than the paying guests!!
 
There is then a leaving ceremony to wish you well on your journey, which is another nice touch.  
 
All the staff were very polite and friendly and keen for us to be happy. And there was certainly no shortage of staff. But providing a five star experience is all about attention to detail. So many silly things that could be fixed. Like the telephone for room service that sounds like they are underwater and so impossible to understand. It is just unnecessary frustration. Like the coffee cups in the room not being paired with the correct matching saucers so they slide around and spill.  Small but so simple.  
 
Occupancy was clearly low while we were there, which is a cause for concern. And it seems tourism across the island has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. But despite local economic challenges there is a global brand to preserve.  Perhaps merging the Anantara Kalutara into the adjacent Avani (already common ownership) and targeting a lower price point with lower expectations, is a solution worth considering.  
 
Perhaps we were just unlucky. But sadly we will not be using any Anantara again.",Couples

Kalutara,Anantara Kalutara Resort,4,Mixed bag,"This is an undoubtedly beautiful hotel in a lovely setting.
The service throughout is fantastic and having room service and drinking sundowners on the balcony to the sound of the ocean was very special.
Food at breakfast very nice with a wide variety and the best cheese we had on our whole tour .
The room servicing by Saman was very thorough.
The room and shower were both lovely and aircon and fan provided a lovely cool haven. 
However there are issues :

The room is the only place to cool down in the whole complex, even the pools are warm . The climate in SL is brutal at times and the bar ( with only one portable air conditioner) and the restaurant ( with none ) are just too hot .

Our room was a very long way away from bar/reception , it took us our whole stay to find the easiest route , we were never shown on arrival.

The cooling system in room needs tweaking. When on balcony at night if doors are open ( which they need to be to cool balcony) the room floor turns into a lethal skating rink .

On night one we had the buffet at a cost of £25 each ( and that is with allegedly 40% off ) , it was ordinary at best , and the restaurant is too warm .
There are 2 other eateries up the road , Red Lobster and Coconut Bay far superior and much cheaper 

Finally we paid over £300 for a room upgrade to a “ deluxe ocean view room “ …. the room was the same as others in our group and the ocean view was at a distance and partially obscured by trees .

Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,An Extremely Memorable Stay,"We stayed just one night at This idyllic property. It has a sense of timelessness and takes you back to the colonial area. It's a beautifully maintained property with breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. We received a warm welcome from butlers Hastha and Manjula, and that set the note for our stay. Both Hastha and Manjula gave us excellent service with always a smile on their faces. It was what made the stay so memorable as well as the beauty of the property. Food was excellent and we enjoyed a jeep ride thru the tea estates in the early hours of the morning. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean with a warm and cosy ambience. Cannot wait to be back for a longer stay. on the morning of our checkout there was Prabod as well besides the smiling Hastha and Manjula, who bid us a warm farewell. looking forward to be back someday soon!!!",Couples

Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,Amazing location for some digital detox,"Starting off from Colombo, Navod: out host was in touch with us to arrange our logistics from the kandy railway station and even our lunch in advance to avoid us waiting when we arrive. They were waiting for us right at the station. The trip to to the resort is a 15-20 minute drive from the Kandy railway station. 

The team including the General Manager Sidath was there to welcome us.

The food and the location is just perfect. And the team was always ready to go above and beyond to meet our expectations. Special shout out to Navod, Sherif, Manjula, Hasitha, Anju, Bhanuka the new joined villa executive (sorry, don't recall his name) and the GM Sidath who takes guest service to the next level by thier actions, not just by words...                                         

Few notes to improve

1. Would be nice if the e-bikes would be in working condition than being in manual mode. Some may appreciate the extra kick to ride back

2. The small ponds around the property could use some cleaning

3. For the minibar for full board guests.. Some softdrinks to be included will be nice.",Couples
Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,Exceptional service above the clouds,"Exceptional service, paradise views

My partner and I enjoyed a 4 night stay at W15 Hanthana Estate, and we already miss being there. This place really exceeded our expectations: The views are unbelievable, we spent hours just soaking it all in from different spots around the property. It’s the perfect place to come to stillness after lots of active travel.

The whole team made our stay wonderful, from the incredible food to the warmth of every interaction. We honestly wouldn’t have had the same experience without them. The butlers are amazing, anticipating our needs before we even realised them ourselves. Manjula is such a gem, bringing warmth, cheer, and genuine care in his service. Navod was also fantastic – he has a great sense of humor and made us feel right at home. A highlight of the stay was our morning hike with Naturalist Aju. His knowledge of the area’s nature but also history and culture made the hike more than a simple excursion (which in itself was gorgeous). Special mention goes to General Manager, Sidath, who went above and beyond with thoughtful touches throughout our stay. We felt like we were treated more like family than guests and hope to return with our family one day. ps. Our last evening at W15 will be one we always remember ❤️",Couples
Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,4,Tranquil stay,Lovely place very tranquil with beautiful views. Food excellent although sometimes a long wait between requesting a drink and then receiving one. Stable room very comfortable but with a tiny wardrobe! Perhaps guests are expected to arrive with little or no luggage! Virtually nowhere to put anything. The open bathroom provides little privacy. The floor mat in our room looked grubby. The staff were very friendly and Sherif asked to be mentioned here.,Couples
Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,One of the most special and unique family experiences,"What an incredible lifetime experience - so difficult to put our awe into words but I will try!  The attention to detail, the staff who all went above and beyond and the sense of space and beauty Hanthana offered us was out of this world.  When we arrived in Hanthana (wife, myself; 11yo, 9yo & 5yo in tow) we were treated to not only a spectacularly misty view over the valley, but a sumptuous High Tea; expertly served by Navod who talked us through the variety of teas we could choose from. Obviously, being in the center of one of the most renowned tea areas in the world has its benefits! W15 were happy to suggest and organise a variety of trips for us and not only did the nearby town of Kandy have a wide selection of cultural trips to partake in (Notably the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple); but the surrounding wilderness offered stunning walks and experiences. Bhanuka, the hotel's resident naturalist took us on a wonderful hike up the mountainside, through the tea plantations. It was perfectly manageable for our 5 year old and I would highly recommend as he talked us through the flora and fauna and excited all 3 children with his stories. It was so good that our 5 year old had to be carried off the mountain as he was too busy looking for buried treasure! Another highlight was the 'Rock Bar' where Navod, our personal butler (!), Bhanuka and Puvi, took us up in the hotel's Land Rover Defender to explore some of the trails and find a local lookout where Navod expertly setup a portable bar to create cocktails and mocktails in the great outdoors. A wonderful setting for me and my wife to enjoy the peace and tranquility and a playground for the children who were busy building dens and hunting for crystals with Bhanuka.  It was like our own personal childcare in the wild!  A firm favourite with the children.   Our guides also spotted a range of wild animals including an eagle, a barking deer and a LEOPARD!  Apparently this was exceptionally rare!  Our final day saw Rasika, the Executive Chef, treat us to a cooking course of local curry dishes where the children took the reins and created a wonderful lunchtime spread. Whilst it was a wonderfully busy couple of days, it was always a pleasure returning to our rooms before the evening meal, being able to soak in the bath and then retire to the veranda for a G&T whilst the children caught fireflies and drank hot chocolates by the fires. So many other wonderful touches to these days - the idyllic pool, the visit to the Tea Museum, the gigantic treehouse swing overlooking the valley, the local tea menu and lobster for lunch.  The list is endess as these are only the highlights.  Fantastic. Many thanks to Sidath and the team, we will be back!",Family

Kandy,W15 Hanthana Estate Kandy,5,Tranquility of a real Tea Plantation,"I remember as a kid running around these tea plantations and spending my summer holidays in these hills. I returned to this area after two decades of living outside of the country and I was blown away with what they have done, an unbelievable transformation but yet, very traditional, clam and serene. Took me straight back to that childhood and those lovely memories. 

If you want to experience what Sri Lanka is all about, I highly suggest visiting here. It's very close to one of the major tourist locations, ""Kandy Temple"" and you will really get the experience of living in a tea plantation. Take a plantation tour in their beautiful truck and you will be transported into a whole different world, filled with happiness and tranquility. The place is breathtaking and  friendliness of the staff truly is amazing. 

Manjula, Hastha, Navod and Prabad helped us through our stay and their commitment to make this place, our visit a memorable one is worth the mention.

The evening sunset was so fabulous over the lagoon after 4pm,,The hotel is having a spacious lagoon deck to enjoy your sunset or to relax with your loved ones even till mid night .
Till dark we enjoyed in the pool the by witnessing all evening dramas in the sky.
The BBQ dinner was superb with a large spread & plenty of choices.Itvwas so nice with all arrangements on the buffet & very tasty in all corners 
Following day breakfast we had at the Moya- rooftop with adding much more glamour to the  view over the lagoon.The view was stunning when look at all over the places from a seven floor rooftop.I would like to name that place as Moya Sky Lounge rather than rooftop.
So about the breakfast no words ,,same as dinner means lot of choices,had enough with local & international foods & each was very tasty.
The lunch was next level buffet with lot of action stations & sea food selection.To be honest to the first time in my life I' ve experienced the Fish egg action station in a buffet 
Thanks & hat off to Ex.Chef Mr.Jude,,chef Mr.Paul Palitha & all assistants at the kitchen for the delesious dishes during our stay.Other hand the hotel is very clean in all areas such as rooms,pool,garden,etc,,
Further the hotel has arranged a swing & floating ferry on the lagoon to add more flavour to your stay,, also two tree houses enjoy your boose with your loved ones.
This hotel is highly recommended to overseas travelers to come enjoy your stay with a different amenities & a passion.Also to transit passengers can enjoy your stay to the next level as the hotel very close to the Airport means just 5-6 km away,,

After staying there at the start of an Intrepid tour, we decided to book ourselves back for our final night before leaving. Staff were very friendly and service at breakfast was great. Between our visits it seems a new manager switched breakfast from the ground floor restaurant to the rooftop one. Spectacular views across the lagoon and up the coast. Pool was great and the reception staff kindly gave us a late checkout for free as our flight was not until the evening.

Definitely recommend this place. Great atmosphere, to enjoy the view and a great variety of dishes to try. Definitely worth staying with your family and loved ones.",Family
Negombo,Amagi Aria,3,Convenient for the airport but dated,"This was by far the most disappointing place we stayed in Sri Lanka and not a great experience for us, although we didn’t pay a high price for it. It didn’t feel at all like a 4 star hotel - more like a basic hotel like a travel lodge. We were only staying for one night prior to returning home so, on a positive, it was extremely convenient to the airport - just 15 minutes away - and we weren’t aware of any aeroplane noise at any time., despite the proximity to the airport. 

However, if I did it again, I would have stayed south of Colombo in a nicer hoteland had a longer drive to the airport. 

The hotel was very dated and a bit grubby. Our room was on the ground floor with patio doors out onto the main pool area. While we were there, there were 2 weddings so we had loud thumpy music in our room and, when this stopped, the neighbouring hotel, which was also right next to our room,  piped up with music and fireworks. 

There was some repairs being done to the plumbing outside our room so we were woken up early by the banging of the maintenance team, having been disturbed by the people in the room next door leaving loudly (sounded like they were in the room as the front door was not very sound-proofed) at 4.30 am. All in all we got very little sleep. 

There were no net curtains in the room so our choice was to keep the curtains drawn and have a dingy room but privacy or open the curtains and give everyone in the pool and terrace area a view right into our room. 

The air conditioning was very cold and noisy and would not switch off with the remote control. The only way we could switch it off was to pull the power through removing the key card but that also disabled the power sockets and meant we couldn’t charge our phones overnight. 

Someone had been sick on the floor amongst the pool sun loungers and this hadn’t been spotted by staff, so I had to ask someone to clean it up. 

Because of the weddings, there was only the buffet available for lunch and the rooftop restaurant was closed - looked like it hadn’t been open for some time. 

The staff were nice enough, there was water in the room and WiFi and you could help yourself to beach towels. These were positives. 

In summary I would say  it was ok as somewhere to lay your head if you had an early start for the airport but I would not recommend it as a place to stay for more than that. We stayed in stunning places for the rest of our holiday and this hotel didn’t come up to the other plces’s standards and we were pleased when it was time to leave.",Couples
Negombo,Amagi Aria,2,once probably nice hotel run down,"Good- In part friendly staff
great shower with more than adequate water pressure (unfortunately shower head calcified and therefore only 50% output)
refreshing pool
nice terrace to sit in the evening
free WIFI

Disliked - all 4 mattresses were catastrophically old, worn out (first time this happened in 14 days Sri Lanka staying in much more modest accommodation before)
- we had booked double beds and were 'upgraded' to better view but separate beds, we asked for additional linen for our third child (who had to sleep in the crack of the two separate beds) and staff was strangely reluctant to comply immediately explaining we could use the other 2 linens to bridge the gap (?). no mention of an extra bed (which to be fair we did not explicitly asked for).
- staff miss-punched the charged amount to pay in Rupies instead of Dollars, the transaction costs are mine
- uncomfortable infestation of the pool area with crows, pool mostly in the shade after 3pm (maybe therefore nice and cool)
- classical example of a probably once nice hotel run down by current management",Family
Negombo,Amagi Aria,3,Average hotel at shoreline,"Great location at the shoreline, but the hotel has seen better days. The breakfast buffet is okay with fruit, freshly made omelets or whatever egg version you prefer. The bread is not worth eating. Tea and coffee are bad. Rooms are okay with a great view of the water.

Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,1,WORST MANAGEMENT EVER. STAFF ARE RUDE AND UNWELCOMING.,"The worst management I have ever experienced in Sri Lanka. It's such a shame because the view is lovely but the staff are rude and extremely unwelcoming. The Manager Mr. Ranjith should be fired because he does not know how to speak to women. 

First time in Sri Lanka and we had 2 friends from Unawatuna who actually recommended the hotel to us come visit during the day. We were sitting quietly in our room with 2 friends and they kept calling us and telling us we are not allowed to have a guest in our room. Then, some staff member came and screamed at us as though he was a gangster asking us to come out of the room. When we asked the Manager who this man was who yelling at us for no reason he says its someone from House Keeping. What a joke. Then they send their receptionist who is a woman to apologize for his behaviour towards us. They refused to make the staff member from housekeeping apologize to us. It was all extremely strange. 

The manager is never at the hotel and didn't make it up to us at all. Don't make the mistake of booking a room here.",Couples

The service is friendly, and the hotel offers free transport to the nearby Jungle beach. However, the rooftop bar and pool provide an even more peaceful and stunning experience, especially at sunset, complemented by excellent cocktails. We booked a Deluxe Double Room with a Balcony and Sea View, which was spotlessly clean and offered a beautiful sea view for a relaxing stay. The food was delicious, set in a calm atmosphere. Don't miss out on their handmade ice creams for dessert—they're some of the best in Sri Lanka. The only aspect that could be improved is the restaurant service, to make the stay even more special. Since we had an early morning flight, the thoughtful staff packed breakfast for us. This place is highly recommended for those seeking a peaceful escape with amazing views and food!

The rooms are cozy and comfortable. The food is lovely with lots of choice. The staff here were just lovely, very polite, kind and willing to help. The pool area is really stunning. 
I also treated myself to a massage whilst there which was really lovely. We can’t wait to return here. It will definitely feature in our next trip to Sri Lanka.",Family

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,2,Development Required,"Good Ambience Great view poor food service 
Some short falls.
1. No one was there to welcome or take bags from vehicle
2. Welcome drink served just by hand to hand
3. Dinner Buffet did not have sufficient beef, instead served pork which was oven heated just for sake of offering. We paid for dinner and its our right to enjoy what we like. 
4. Morning no sufficient coconut sambol, chef told he will bring from kitchen and he was not at all available until we leave restaurant. 
Very poor restaurant service, as each and everything to be requested for refilling. 
Food was not at all value for money that we paid. 
Even the spread is small there should be sufficient food. Seems locals are not very much respected. 
This is my personal opinion and not at all a happy stay.",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,Cozy mountain retreat,"A stunning boutique hotel with breathtaking views of the mountains! The rooms are thoughtfully designed with functional yet stylish touches—perfect shower fittings, spacious closets, and small balconies that offer serene views and a cozy spot to relax.

The patio dining at the restaurant lets you enjoy incredible mountain views, making every meal extra special. The staff were incredibly warm and welcoming—special shoutout to Mr. Dhambekar, who went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable with his kindness, helpfulness, and ever-smiling presence.

They accommodated all our requests, gave excellent local recommendations, and the kitchen staff prepared amazing vegetarian options for us. From the small outdoor pool with a fabulous view to the deck for high tea and relaxation, everything about our stay was perfect. The food was exceptional too!

Pro Tip: The last 2-3 km to the hotel is a steep and narrow path, but there are plenty of signs to guide you.

We were truly sad to leave and would highly recommend this mountain retreat!",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,2,Review of Fox Kandy Hotel – Disappointing Second Visit,"This was our second visit to Fox Kandy Hotel, but unfortunately, we had several disappointing experiences this time.

Firstly, they did not respond to our emails, which was quite frustrating. When I tried to book directly through their website as a Sri Lankan resident, they quoted Rs. 57,000 for a half-board stay for a couple. However, when I made the reservation through a travel agent using my non-resident husband's details, I was offered a much cheaper rate, which was quite disappointing and felt unfair.

Regarding the food, the options were very limited, and the taste did not meet our expectations. It lacked variety and flavor compared to our previous visit.

The room we were given initially looked good, but when we went to sleep, we realized that what appeared to be a king-size bed was actually two smaller beds joined together with separate mattresses. This made it quite uncomfortable and disrupted our sleep.

Another downside was the driver’s accommodation. Unlike our last visit, where it was included, we were now required to pay separately for both his food and stay, which was an unexpected inconvenience.

Overall, this visit fell short of our expectations, and unfortunately, we will not be returning to this hotel. Based on our experience, I cannot honestly recommend it to others.",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,A pleasant experience at Fox Kandy,"The journey from Kandy to Fox Hill was a bit challenging, as the road leading to the hotel required some careful navigation. We traveled by taxi, and since the hotel is perched atop a hill, the drive was somewhat demanding.

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed with a delightful cup of tea. Although the official check-in time was 2:00 pm, the hotel generously allowed a free early check-in at 12:30 pm, which was a thoughtful gesture, even though I couldn’t make it early.

The views from the hotel are truly breathtaking! Despite the overcast skies, strong breeze, and light drizzle during our stay, the surrounding hills looked spectacular and added to the serene ambiance.

The staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, making us feel at home. Our room was cozy and comfortable, though we didn’t use the pool as the weather was too cold and windy for my preference.

As our booking included only breakfast, we enjoyed a delightful meal the next morning. The spread was satisfying and well-prepared.

We faced some difficulty arranging a return taxi, but the reception staff went above and beyond to help us by organizing a tuk-tuk at a reasonable rate. Their assistance made our departure much smoother.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Fox Resorts and look forward to visiting again in the future.",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,4,Good with some flaws:,"The grounds of the hotel are absolutely beautiful and peaceful. The staff is very responsive, polite and provide great service.

The rooms are clean and have great air conditioning. 

The one flaw is that insects and lizards might be in the room with you. This was the only thing that detracted from our stay.",Family
Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,A great stay at Fox Kandy.,"This is a really lovely hotel and we enjoyed our stay here a lot. It is spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The buffet in the restaurant was the nicest we have had on our travels in Sri Lanka and we have stayed now at a few places.  The room was very comfortable, bed was great, there is nothing to dislike here. I would highly recommend Fox Kandy and all who work there.",Couples

Kandy,Fox Kandy by Fox Resorts,5,Fine hotel in a quiet area above Kandy,"We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel high above Kandy, with great views into the hills and down to the city.  The original private villa has been expanded by the addition of a large airy dining room; most rooms are in groups of four.  Access is by windy roads, but it doesn’t take long to get in to the city.  The staff are very friendly, especially Lahiru and Gamini in the restaurant.  Food is good: dinners and breakfasts are a la carte when there are few guests, otherwise buffet.  The rooms are pleasant and well appointed, with recently updated bathrooms - though the bathroom light won’t turn off at night.  The pool is small but nice to cool off in.",Couples

Download pick me app for tuk tuks. Head to jungle beach on their complimentary shuttle (tough climb down but we did it with a 6 and 3 year old). Head to unawatuna beach and in to the galle fort.

Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,To infiniti and beyond.....,"We finished our 17 day tour of Sri Lanka at Agnus and it was an excellent choice.  It is a 20 minute tuk tuk ride to/from the busyness of Fort Galle so was lovely to return to the oasis of Agnus. 
Our room was a corner one on the north side with superb views looking over the bay to Fort Galle. The staff were helpful and friendly. Excellent breakfast and one of the better dinners we had touring Sri Lanka. Enjoyed relaxing on the roof at the infiniti pool along with early evening cocktails.  We also enjoyed an excellent massage our last one on the island. Would love to return someday.",Couples
Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,Spectacular sea views of ullawatuna shores,"Agnus Ullawatuna is a boutique property on top of the mountain with 12 rooms. We stayed in their sea facing room which had spectacular views of the shoreline.

The room was tidy and modern with a good washroom and the provides shower gel and shampoo was high quality.

The breakfast was well prepared and good to taste but it it not a buffet.
We had opted for the sea facing rooms.",Couples
Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,Truly delightful week-long stay at Agnus.,"We had a truly delightful week-long stay at Agnus. The room was light, spacious, and immaculate, with a very comfortable bed, refreshing rain shower, and stunning sea views overlooking Galle.
The delicious food, refreshing drinks, meticulous cleaning, and friendly, attentive service further elevated our experience.
The rooftop pool and bar provided a welcome bonus, offering a chance to relax and enjoy the views.
While exploring the bustling Unawatuna beach area was easy by foot or tuk-tuk, returning to the serene atmosphere of Agnus was always the highlight.",Couples

To wake up each morning and open the curtains to that view made our time in Sri Lanka very special. 

The roof top pool also shares the stunning views and  they had a live performer on the Saturday night of our stay who was amazing.

Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,A Hidden Gem!,"We had booked Agnus not quite knowing what to expect and we were bowled over by how wonderful it was. Stunning views, a lovely room with a superb balcony and one of the best showers we've come across, a brilliant pool-bar-deck, very good food and, above all, outstanding service from a team of friendly and hugely obliging staff. We'd especially like to mention Chaminda, who absolutely made our stay with his warmth and hospitality. We will almost certainly be returning here at some time in the future and can't recommend this gem of a place enough!",Couples
Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,A good start into 2024 with incredible staff and scenery,"We were at the hotel with a Dutch family of six. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. In particular Mahindra, the waiter, does an excellent job. The chef cook, although still young, is very good and talented. The homemade jam and homemade cake are just delicious. As the hotel is small, it all feels quite personal, but the service is in accordance with high international standards. A good place to relax, enjoy the beautiful scenery and hang out with family or friends.",Family
Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,A charming place to stay,"This is a simple and charming place to stay. The building is beautifully designed and its setting high up above the sea is perfect.

Everyone in the hotel is very welcoming, especially its charming manager.",Couples
Unawatuna,Agnus Unawatuna,5,one of the hotels with the best views.,"I was blown away by the breathtaking view from the hotel's entrance. And the room view, infinity pool and bar, and restaurant all have the same mesmerizing view that you can enjoy endlessly. The infinity pool's sunset view was far more amazing.
 The staff was extremely friendly, and they provided beach towels as well as tuk tuk service to both the jungle and white sand beaches. Our stay was extremely value for money.",Couples
