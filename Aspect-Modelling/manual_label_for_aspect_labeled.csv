we had chosen the riu at ahungalla for our annual trip there were  adults and  kids in our group checking was lil bit hard cause the pax was large but overall experience was great we didnt tried out the japanese and italian restaurants and spa n others but we had enjoyed the live musics in the night and the club club is not recommending cause the musics were so bad even the remix was destroyed other than that riu is a nice place to visit,93,Location

"we stayed at the hilton yala resort for  days in may and had the most amazing time the reviews and photos that you see on trip advisor paints a true picture of the resort and experience and it did not disappoint
this was our first visit to sri lanka and we wanted to stay somewhere close to the national park so that we could do the odd safari or two whilst also relaxing by the pool of the main resort the location was ideal with it being right in the national park
and only a short drive away to the main entrance of block  
upon arrival we were warmly greeted with a cold towel and welcome drink and then shown into the main entrance to the hotel through a huge doorway that led into the reception lounge and bar area from here there are floor to ceiling windows with a view over the resort pool area and indian ocean giving a true wow factor

having preselected our room through the hilton app  hours prior to arrival to be close to the elephant trail we were then taken by buggy to our room as hh diamond members we were upgraded to a premium room with plunge pool
unfortunately our preselection hadnt been noted and we were allocated a room next to the main pool we raised this with the hotel team and were initially told that the rooms are allocated  hours in advance and therefore they hadnt received our request this was swiftly resolved and we were then taken to the preselected room
the room was very luxurious with plenty of space soft furnishings and mood lighting the bed was very comfortable with a pillow menu at your disposal the bathroom had twin sinks rainfall shower bathtub and a toto toilet the terrace had a table and chairs two sun loungers a sofa and the plunge pool it overlooked the elephant trail that runs through the hotel grounds and whilst there was evidence of wild animals having walked past we didnt see any during our stay
the room was cleaned daily with a turn down service in the evening

we spent most of our time by the main pool and as most guests are here for the national park and safaris it was mostly quiet and felt like our own private pool at times there were plenty of sun loungers and the pool staff were always very friendly and greeted you with a warm welcome and smile

the food offered in the hotel is up there with some of the best food we have had and we have stayed in many  star hotels around the world as hh diamond members we were upgraded from continental to full breakfast along with  off food and spa treatments for breakfast you can order a variety of dishes alacarte and there is also a small buffet area with pastries and cereal each dish was beautifully presented and was delicious our personal favourites were the hummus on rye toast and french toast all meals are served in the dhira restaurant which is next to the reception and bar area there is another restaurant on the ground floor near the main pool however this was not used during our stay as most guests are seated in the dhira restaurant 
for evening meals you have the option to choose from a variety of menus offering local and international dishes all meals were delicious and again well presented we were also encouraged to order dishes off menu as the head chef encouraged you to eat whatever you fancied
we would have the occasional lunch sat by the pool area and the food was equally well presented

the spa and gym are well appointed and we used both during our stay the spa treatments were great and the staff very welcoming

we went on two morning safaris and were able to see all that the national park has to offer we decided to book the safari directly with the hotel and whilst more expensive than other options available through viator or other similar sites it is worth paying the extra money we had our own private vehicle and ranger and were given breakfast boxes whilst in the park having your own personal ranger allowed you to learn more about the park and resident animals 

what really stood out for us during our stay was the staff every single member of the hilton yala team were welcoming and friendly walking to the pool or restaurant in the morning the room cleaners gardeners pool staff buggy drivers would all stop smile and say good morning as we walked past it is therefore very difficult to name individual staff members having said that chanaka from the fb team really set the tone for our stay he was always kind and happy to serve our breakfast or dinner and would also encourage us to order as much as we wanted 

thank you hilton yala team for making our stay truly memorable and we will no doubt return in the near future",300,Location
"uga chena huts offer a nearperfect robinson crusoe boutique hotel experience  a mile away the wild coast hotel offers a lessgood experience and costs more

the uga chena rooms are highceilinged and airy many with views of the adjacent lagoon the contemporary dining room and reception areas are beautifully designed  simple pareddown and elegant  and the staff are smiling and attentive

at sunset they light a brazier on the beach and offer complimentary cocktails to watch the sun go own with the roar of the ocean immediately adjacent  memories really are made of this  the setting is utterly unspoilt and magical and surpassed our expectations

would we go back  absolutely  a two or three night stay is probably best",2,Service
"the staff and the service of the hotel is very good  
the room we got was unfortunately a city view buth clean and spacious enough
the property has located in front of the beach and they have sea view rooms restauranta swimming pool as well
my experience at mirage was remarkable",290,Room
the food here was great and the service provided by jayaweera was amazing great atmosphere with live music as well,29,Food
"an excellent stay  staff deserve the utmost respect

we had an excellent stay at radh hotel from the moment we arrived the staff were incredibly welcoming professional and attentive to every detail the hotel itself is beautifully maintained offering a perfect blend of comfort and elegance our room was spotless wellappointed and provided a truly relaxing experience

however during our stay we were deeply ashamed to witness the way some tourists mistreated the hardworking staff we saw an incident where a guest after breaking several plates refused to take responsibility and instead threatened to leave a negative review on tripadvisor to avoid paying the staff despite being in an unfair and helpless situation handled it with patience and professionalism

as guests who appreciate good service and ethical behavior we want to extend our apologies to the staff on behalf of responsible travelers no one should have to endure such intimidation simply for doing their job hospitality workers deserve respect and it is disheartening to see some guests exploit platforms like tripadvisor to manipulate situations in their favor

we highly recommend radh hotel and commend the staff for their dedication thank you for making our stay memorablewe will certainly return",7,Service

we really enjoyed our stay the pools are wonderful we had  lovely villas and shared a pool the staff were very helpful we have  kids in their s and they really enjoyed the beaches and the waves it suited them perfectly the only reason why we wouldnt return is because  of us are vegetarian and the options are very limited literally one or  options for the evening meal which was surprising and a bit disappointing considering everywhere else we visited offered many options so we decided to eat out which didnt matter at all but it would have been nice to have had more options when we did eat in for the  nights,55,Food

"after a night at a run down hotel the night before we were delighted when we arrived at this lovely hotel the rooms are spacious clean  with the most stunning views

"we stayed at this beautiful tropical paradise for  days therefore we got to know the history and the staff a bit to write an honest review

architecture
amaranth bay was built only  years ago built for comfort with an american type of architectural design similar to the hilton or the marriott  luxury and spacey high tech but elegant  quality materials the hard wood floor was a feature that i appreciated very much  sunlight fills the room all day long the jacuzzi room could easily serve as a sauna  the balcony with quality wooden chairs and table was comfortable to sit and watch the sunset plus the view of the lagoon and way over the yonder  i loved the touch screen light control panel for all the lights throughout the m suite the sitting room was spacious the king size bed was comfortable the big mirrors with surrounding led soft lightsbig shower with rainforest shower head good pressure and load of hot water  
the towels are big and fluffy as they machined dry and not sundry hence it was a joy to dry myself with these towels  i dont mind sundry but machined dry feels like im at home in the states  amenitiestoiletries were nice and handy  one liter bottles of water daily more when we asked for more  
good housekeeping a team of two male staff the whole time we were there  they were very friendly helpful and very polite  
the ground was immaculately clean and well kept ground keepers constantly on the move keeping the garden beautiful  the pool guy was super friendly helpful and thoughtful no minute detail could escape his attention  

overall the whole complex was very well designed and maintained of course its a tropical country with high humidity so there ought to be some damage to the paint but i noticed that they do their best with the upkeeping  

now the food was another matter entirely there was absolutely no consistency  one day it was fine from the buffet breakfast when there were more guests then the nest day same breakfast buffet but it was not well cooked or well prepared   one time the milk rice was cold and as hard as a rock  unbelievable
the dishes werent authentic enough for us especially the level of spiciness knowing that their dishes were prepared to serve guests that are not used to spicy dishes  hence we made it clear to the kitchen staff that we wanted authentic spicy sri lankan dishes it worked but as soon as there was a difference chef or not our usual server to take note then it all went back to square one again  well needless to say we were disappointed in the dishes they have in the menu  fixed menu when there werent enough guests buffet when the hotel is busy  

though we must give credit where credit is due the management and the staff were very kind to accommodate our requests they even took the dinner order ahead of time to make sure all was in order  however as soon as there was a change in staff or chef rotation all the work went out the window  there was a huge lack of communication consistency and discipline  
we enjoyed massively the accommodation but we were very disappointed in the dishes that they served  we had high expectations before we arrived to amaranth bay as we stayed at  sri lankan hotels before arriving to this lovely hotel and we had amazingly delicious and authentic cuisine until then    we would return but will be eating elsewhere unless they made massive changes to their menu but will we risk it at the time of booking",17,Location

"we had a truly memorable experience at the iconic galle face hotel in colombo today the setting is absolutely stunning  a perfect blend of colonial charm and seaside elegance we especially enjoyed the high tea on the terrace with breathtaking views of the indian ocean and the gentle sea breeze adding to the ambience

a special mention goes to krishma who made our high tea experience even more exceptional she was warm attentive and incredibly professional  ensuring that everything ran smoothly and that we felt well taken care of throughout her thoughtful service really stood out and added a personal touch to an already wonderful afternoon

galle face hotel continues to uphold its reputation for timeless elegance and outstanding hospitality highly recommended for anyone visiting colombo",69,Location

"we stayed here for  nights while we explored the area its in a good location for sigiriya rock among other things 

the staff are very friendly our butler samman was particularly great we stayed in a marsh dwelling the room itself was very quirky and a unique experience which was fun the bathroom is outside while still being private perhaps an odd experience but there were alternate loos as well 

we used the bathspa in the room after hiking sigiriya lovely deep bath but be careful of frogs in the pipes we accidentally boiled some  

our pool area was lovely and we got to see some greedy monkeys playing in the trees which was very special 

the food was ok not great not bad the menu was the same everyday so  days was enough time to get bored of the offering the breakfast however was good try and spot the crocodile

the spa was ok good value a  minute massage was  gbp however the spa treatment rooms are open above the water so there were a lot of bugs 

bugs are an inevitable of this hotel due to location etc however they are doing a lot to try and counteract them citronella planting etc",3,Location
"i immediately regretted my decision to book this hotel for my family and me as soon as we entered our room the room quality was poor far below my expectations for a reputed hotel having stayed at hikka tranz several times i had hoped that citrus would at least be a decent alternative unfortunately that was not the case

the room we received was extremely basic and lacked essential amenities except for shampoo and body wash in the bathroom to make matters worse the toilet wall had visible fungus which was both shocking and disgusting for a hotel of this reputation even the swimming pool was disappointing and did not meet our expectations we genuinely felt that the experience was not worth the money we paid

in the morning as we stepped out of our room we were greeted by a plate of leftover food on the floor additionally a broken bed and mattress were left in the hallway even the framed pictures on the walls had mold growing inside them it was disheartening to see that no effort had been made to maintain or improve the hotels quality when we inquired about this the staff mentioned that renovations were planned for april but this still did not justify the current condition of the hotel

the only redeeming factor of our stay was the staff they were wonderful they ensured that we had a pleasant experience wherever possible and even at the restaurant they served us with warm smiles

i sincerely hope that the hotel management takes immediate action to refurbish the hotel and improve its standards otherwise guests will soon realize that the pictures shared online do not reflect the reality on the ground",128,Room

"the location is easily accessible and the rooms are spacious impeccably clean and offer a cozy ambiance perfect for chilly weather this heritage vintagestyle hotel provides a classic experience that truly feels worth the value both in terms of accommodation and dining the staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodatingespecially notable as we traveled with our yearold for whom they thoughtfully prepared special offmenu meals and my father who uses a wheelchair
we enjoyed dining at grand indian grand thai magnolia and barns hall buffet all of which offered highquality food at reasonable prices the only minor downside was that tea was somewhat pricey which is surprising for a teaproducing country
every staff member was outstanding making our stay even more pleasant the garden was beautifully maintained and stunning so much so that we spent most of our threeday stay relaxing within the hotel grounds",121,Food
"this hotel has become one of our favourite hotels so far

"we spent  days here rounding off our tour of sri lanka this beachside hotel featured an extensive pool area  m pool for serious swimmers and smaller pools for children the hotels grounds are quite large allowing guests to find private spots if desired the hotel grounds give access to a sandy beach but sea swimming is not the main theme due to surf and currents
the rooms are spacious and wellequipped with comfortable beds and pillows we chose the bed and breakfast option but noted there are not many dining options nearby without taking a taxi a tuk tuk ride to galle approximately  km away costs about  each way with drivers willing to wait a couple of hours for you in the price
breakfast at the hotel offers a wide variety including pastries fresh fruit smoothies cooked breakfast options and continental bread basket selections many might find a midday meal unnecessary after a substantial breakfast
the main menu is extensive featuring sri lankan curries prawn and fish options as well as chicken lamb and vegetarian dishes there are also burger chicken  and fish and chips options for those who prefer less spicy food most main courses are priced around  usd with starters ranging from  to  usd we found a main course sufficient though however a couple of glasses of wine and beer can double the price of a meal
the staff were consistently excellent throughout the hotel while service in the restaurant occasionally suffered when busy this appeared to be a management or training issue rather than a reflection on the staff who were always responsive and helpful
overall the country is very welcoming with friendly locals who value tourism the accommodation food quality and service were all commendable
