We here for a 2 day safari adventure and opted for a full day safari, 
The tents are quite simplistic, good ventilation, no TV, very very rustic and enjoyable surrounded by nature.
During the safari, we nearly drove around at least about 135 KM within the park.
Though bumpy (expected) its was quite an experience to see so many animals up close.
Fortunately we had an experience driver, Kasun and a even more knowledgeable naturalist, Dilhara, whose knew the park by the back of his hand and was very detailed in his explanation of both the flora, fauna and especially the animals whereabouts.
i will highly recommend anyone to visits this place and enjoy the nature in raw. Suited for all ages.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible.
We enjoyed three game drives and managed to see Leopards on 2 separate occasions which is apparently extremely rare. Our driver and Naturalist were amazing with their knowledge.
Unfortunately the actual tented safari camp was a major disappointment.
The tents themselves are old with the floors being so damp we had to wear shoes in the tent so our feet didn't get wet.
The company doesn't provide mosquito nets which would have been fine if the tents didn't have holes in them letting in all the bugs. One tent had a crab next the bed in the morning.
First night we had no hot water. This was rectified but the next issue was the pressure pump then constantly turning on and off for the next 24 hours- no sleep.  After raising this issue with the staff, we were informed that that is normal - no its not!!!
The shower was adequate but the smell in the toilet /shower area was disgusting. Upon investigation, the shower runoff simply goes behind the tent and there was an open hole on top of the sewage pit. Hence the smell. 
The food was nice Sri Lankan food with plenty available.
To keep your drinks cold there is a communal fridge in the main area. This means every time you want a drink you have to walk from your tent - our 2 tents were about 150 metres from the main area. Also make sure phone has plenty of charge as you will need your torch. They did not provide one and navigating at night is impossible without one.
We have stayed in many safari style accomodations throughout the world and this is by far the worst for value. 
If the price was around $300 per night I probably would have sucked it up and not posted this review. But for US$1800 for 2 tents for 2 nights, the company needs to do a lot better.
We chose this company as it was owned by people living in Australia (we are Aussies).
I feel sorry for the staff as they work so hard to please all the guests, but they are let down by old and inadequate infrastructure.","Not worth the money!!!!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d1226088-r1003453256-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Yala-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","2","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager531275","Voyager531275","7F76F73789E4F1B80033998BA8D9DECD",,,,,"Voyager531275"

Without him we probably wouldn't have seen so many animals! We even spotted some leopards, elefants and crocodiles! 
Our driver Kasun did a great job as well and we felt very comfortable the whole time! 
Food was amazing and full of varieties.
The only thing you should be prepared of, that during the stay in the camp you can only use the bathroom within the tent, so make sure you're close with the people you're going with;) 
Also the flush there doesn't have a lot of pressure, so pooping could be kind of a problem;)

The location of the resort is beautiful. It’s up in the mountains, and we had the most amazing views from our Beehive Room, the swimming pool, and even the dining area. Everywhere you looked, there were stunning mountain views.

One thing that really stood out to us was how well they looked after our food needs. We don’t eat onion or garlic, and every day the chef made us special meals off the menu. It meant a lot to us and made our stay even more comfortable.

What we loved the most was their attitude. It felt like the word “no” didn’t exist for them. Every request we had, big or small, was taken care of with a smile.

Since we stayed there for 6 nights, the resort even surprised us with a small going-away gift. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made us feel really special.

We left with lovely memories and so much appreciation for the whole team.","The best Stay at Dream Cliff Mountain Resort","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r1014771202-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",,"50","143949387","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/94/7e/4b/khushal-h.jpg","50","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khushalh2015","Khushal H","530D4E9B3F19C2A83EB2620DA866B91F",,,,,"khushalh2015"

The backdrop was the majestic cliffs of the Haputale Range. Very well kept dome shaped rooms, two pools including one infinity pool merging with the rolling hills and the planes. All the staff, service and the food were excellent.  The manager Mr Raphael Dias had his feet firmly on the ground and took good care of us. Steward Athula went out of his way assisted by Pradeep, to mention only a few.  Reminded us of     Rev Walter Stanley Senior, that English poet with a Sri Lankan heart, who was in love with this area and whose  ashes are interred at the most picturesque St. Andrew's Church, Haputale, nearby.

The beehive cabanas are all overlooking the beautiful and breathtaking Beragala gap, with the udawalawe reservoir in the back ground. We spent hours on our balcony as the view seemed to change every few minutes based on the sun! When it was behind a cloud the mist slowly crept in between the mountains creating shadows on land below, and when the sun came out the mist disappeared illuminating the hills and valleys. We were even able to experience the early morning sunrise and evening sunset from the comfort of our balcony.
The resort is above a panoramic view of mountain ranges with an infinity pool that allows us to soak in the sun while enjoying the view.

The restaurant is very spacious and the food was delicious! The staff were very accommodating and went over and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.
We went on a hike and the hotel arranged transport and a guide to take us which was very helpful. The village trek ends at a beautiful waterfall which was a thrill for all of us.
Highly recommend this resort as a hill country getaway!

La piscina es preciosa con todas las vistas a la naturaleza desde el agua... El restaurante está detrás y tomar algo al atardecer es una gran experiencia. 
La cena y desayuno muy correcto y siempre intentando agradar y hacer lo que mejor te convenga. Nosotros desayunamos el ""continental"" y estaba lleno de comida, diferentes panes, confituras, croissants, zumos, cafés, y huevos del tipo que quieras que te cocinan y te traen a la mesa. 
Las habitaciones son cabañas muy auténticas en medio de la naturaleza. Yo estaba dentro de la habitación y por mi terraza cruzaron varias veces diferentes animales, mamíferos, con toda tranquilidad pensando que no había nada. La habitación es una única pieza como una cabaña que se comunica baño y habitación por arriba y la acústica es diferente (con eco) por la forma de la cabaña pero es una experiencia única. Las habitaciones (cogimos 2 cabañas porque íbamos con niños) muy limpias, el aire acondicionado funcionaba perfectamente, el baño y la ducha super agradables (suelo de piedras, jabones todo lo que necesitábamos estaba) y las camas muy cómodas. 
El personal en todo momento nos ayudó con maletas, con los niños y estuvo pendiente de que pasaramos una velada fantástica y así fue.

Une affaire de goût, en effet…
Pour notre part, nous avons à peu près tout apprécié ici: l’accueil bien sûr, la vue époustouflante sur la vallée et les collines environnantes mais aussi la décoration de l’hôtel et du bungalow (on peut ne pas aimer le Bleu de Klein),  et l’originalité de cette salle de bain. Alors, c’est vrai qu’il y a un petit problème d’intimité et que la cloison séparant chambre et salle de bain gagnerait à être étendue jusqu’au plafond car en plus, les sons sont amplifiés par la configuration bungalow. La cuisine, loin d’être infecte, est goûteuse, surtout les spécialités sri-lankaises.
La bouteille d’eau pétillante de 37 cl est facturée 350 Rs soit environ 1,2 €, les cocktails environ 8€, les petits pain (qu’il faut réclamer car ils ne les portent pas spontanément) sont délicieux, servis chaud avec du beurre salé.
Le repas d’hier soir était un grand moment, agrémenté en outre d’un accompagnement musical sous la forme d’un joueur de flûte dispensant une musique très zen.
Le petit-déjeuner sri-lankais est excellent, généreux et équilibré. Si vous préférez, un petit déjeuner continental est proposé, qui est très correct.
La piscine à débordement est superbe, exposée plein sud et s’ouvrant sur le paysage grandiose de la vallée, et suffisamment grande pour qu’on puisse nager sans atteindre le bord opposé au bout de 10 ou 12 brasses.
N.B: À notre arrivée à hier, notre guide et notre chauffeur ont eu droit comme nous à une serviette et une boisson rafraîchissantes.","Une affaire de goût ?

The pool table room was musty, which was quite disappointing because we love to play pool.

The swimming pool was great and the lobby and gardens are lovely. The views of the surrounding area are STUNNING.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. I am truly sorry to hear about the inconvenience you experienced during your stay with us. This is certainly not the impression we wish to leave with our guests.

Following our internal investigation, I would like to clarify that our recommended room temperature setting is 22°C, and not 17°C. The condensation issue you encountered was due to the extremely high humidity levels and continuous monsoon rains that are currently affecting the entire southern coastal region. This has also impacted many large-scale hotels in the area, and we are actively working together as an industry to explore sustainable long-term solutions.

In recognition of the discomfort caused, we extended a complimentary dinner, a fruit basket with a personalized apology letter, and made every effort to assist you during your stay. I genuinely regret that despite these efforts, we fell short of your expectations.

Please rest assured, your comments regarding housekeeping timing and room conditions have been taken seriously and shared with the relevant teams for immediate review and corrective action.

If there is anything further you would like to share or if I can be of assistance in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly at arshad.zaid@radissonblu.com.

Warm regards,
Arshad Zaid

Management told us that we had to keep the room at this temperature to stop the condensation 🤦‍♀️. We had to get another blanket as it was so cold.  We couldn’t stay in the room because it was so cold, and it didn’t seem to stop the condensation.  We put the temperature back to 22 just so we could be in the room.  It was also very dangerous as the floor was slippery and we had to use our bath towels on the floor to stop us from falling over! Our room didn’t get cleaned until after 6pm the next day as the Sri Lankan cricket team had arrived and this took priority - the next day it was 5pm as we were trying to get ready to go out.

We got a very warm welcome by the staff members. The reception and the checking staff was very nice, pleasent  and helpful. The room, cleanliness, amenities, atmosphere and the view was excellent. Excellent food remarkable service. The drink which was made out of tambili was very nice and refreshing. They do some nice cocktails. I thought the room service food menu prices are  a bit too expensive and was the only reason which made us stop a ordering from the room service menu even though we wanted to order something. Each and every food item which we had at the buffet was very mouthwatering tasty and remarkable. Probably it's the most tastiest food and the best buffet you can find in this part of Sri Lanka. The very blessed atmosphere which you can find in down south. They have a kids play area which kept our naughty little boy occupied and happy. The pool is very nice and clean we didn't feel like to coming out of it . The roof top bar and the pool bar have a great atmosphere they also provide a excellent service and they do some nice cocktails.
Each and every staff member who we met had a very pleasant smile and very positive never say no attitude. We went there for a one night stay but because of all of these good things which we got to experience we extended our stay for one more night. Special thanks to the general manager Mr.Kedar, Mr.Chamika at the front office, Mr.Harsha at the f&b, The chef and all the wonderful staff at radisson blue who made our stay a remarkable one. Very nice property we will not hesitate to go there again whenever we get a chance because nothing will make us enough staying at this property. This is our honest and heartfelt opinion.
Thank you team radisson blue for making us happy.","Remarkable stay at Radisson blue resort Galle","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r1007512077-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","11","41","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wathsalalokumanage","Wathsala L","D1E821C859DA9F8692BEA199096584E7",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","wathsalalokumanage"

I experienced excellent hospitality by all staff who went over and above to make my stay pleasant and comfortable. The staff at the front desk were friendly, flexible and attentive at all times. The hotel boasts an excellent in-house restaurant under the direction of Rasika, Executive Chef, offering a wide range of foods inspired by cuisines around the world presented with the assistance of many expert hands including pastry chef Nipun Nethsara and Anuhas. I would like to thank other catering staff including Champaka, Priyantha and Gihan who provided a swift and excellent service.
The rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean thanks to House-keeping staff, Yasaratne Basnayake and Ravindu, making my stay a comfortable and pleasant one.  The Mirage houses a roof top restaurant with a breathtaking view of the sea and the beach and surrounding areas, and also pool and gym facilities.

Le personnel de chambre est très professionnel, s’adapte à nos horaires et en plus très sympathique. Mention spéciale pour Ruwan et Dinesh pour le house keeping, tout était parfait.
Autre mention spéciale à Nana, l’excellente masseuse du SPA de l’hôtel, que l’on conseille pour ses massages d’exception !! 

Tout était super, nous avons passé un séjour au top en famille, avec enfants de 5 et 10 ans et personne handicapée, tout à été super !

L'accueil est très beau ainsi que le personnel qui est adorable. Les chambres sont sympa mais le plus c'est la terrasse qui donne sur la piscine, la vue est magnifique au milieu de la végétation, c'est vraiment très beau. Les consommations au bar sont un peu plus excessives que dans les autres hôtels visites lors de notre circuit, et la restauration est très bonne. Nous sommes restés 2 nuits lors de notre circuit, le 1er soir il y avait un musicien et le 2eme un saxophoniste, avec qui nous avons mis une super ambiance et même dansé dans le resto. Le jardin extérieur accessible du resto du bout est tout simplement un endroit où il fait bon rester, un calme y règne, l'ambiance est apaisante ! Je recommande cet hotel.

The condition of the room was poor, the shower door did not close, creating a pool of water in the bathroom. The shower cubicle had mould in it, the room telephones had incorrect room numbers pasted on them. There was a significant lack of attention to detail. 
Although we called reception several times, communication was difficult as no one could understand the concerns. Better training of reception staff is recommended. The food offered was awful. There was nothing in the dinner buffet that tasted any good, this includes the Sri-Lankan style fusion cuisine they tried to create and other. We were a large family staying there, and all agreed that food was terrible. We will not be recommending this hotel to any of our friends or family.","Disappointing experience at the Earl's Regency Hotel","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1199465-d316956-r1004189980-Earl_s_Regency_Hotel-Kundasale_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nimh2025","Nim H","2081B4FCFA6436CE7B9D0DD9A18C1A6B",,,,,"nimh2025"

Heavy mosquitoes, dimly lit place....plus with the experience from the Manager in acknowledging the error, but refusing to do anything about it....felt like a homestay setup.

A special mention goes to Akash, the bartender, who was exceptionally attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. His friendly demeanor and prompt service truly stood out and added a personal touch to our evenings at the bar.

I also want to commend the hotel manager Saminda, who was equally friendly and always available to assist with anything we needed. Their warm and professional approach truly made us feel welcome.

We were really happy with our choice. 

This quaint & authentic hotel is perfectly situated in a slightly quieter part of beautiful Galle, still within easy walking distance from all of the sights & sounds. Rooms were immaculately clean with large modern bathrooms. We were extremely well looked after by the hotel staff, particularly so by Sithija & Akanasha who couldn't do enough to help. They were a great credit to this lovely hotel. 

Sithija set our outside table up for breakfast every morning so that we could all sit together. Breakfast was fantastic, huge choices cooked to perfection - with a Sri Lankan breakfast option also on offer. As we were staying for 5 nights we were all treated to a complimentary 3 course dinner, it was superb and once again served on our favourite outside table. 

We absolutely loved Galle and this hotel played a key part in our enjoyment, wonderful staff, great food and a perfect location. 

If we ever come back to Galle we would definitely book this hotel again.

wisten we dat we op een bijzondere plek waren beland. De ontvangst bij de receptie was warm en professioneel we voelden ons meteen welkom. Het personeel was gedurende ons hele verblijf buitengewoon vriendelijk.

De kamer? Werkelijk prachtig. Brandschoon en voorzien van alle gemakken die je maar kunt wensen: een heerlijk bed, luxe badkamer, perfect werkende airco en een adembenemend uitzicht!

Elke ochtend genoten we van een ontbijt dat eerder als een feestmaal aanvoelde. Verse producten, ruime keuze, en alles tot in de puntjes verzorgd. Ook het restaurant van het hotel verdient een speciale vermelding.

Wat dit hotel écht bijzonder maakt, is de sfeer. Het voelt als een perfecte balans tussen luxe en gastvrijheid. Geen kille overdaad, maar warmte en klasse.

It has a stunning pool, an adequate gym and lovely views from all rooms.  There are lots of organised leisure activities around the pool.  The food at all meals is some of the best mass-produced hotel food I’ve ever eaten.  It’s all buffet style but very good and very safe.  It’s a bit of a distance from Galle Fort and the main city but there are plenty of tuk tuks available.

It could be a great hotel with a lot more attention to detail.  The first room we were shown was awful, with only one side table by the bed, an extra bed along the side and hardly any room to hang clothes.  As we were staying for two weeks we needed more space.  The rather officious front office staff told us that there were no suites available for us to upgrade. But once we contacted the marvellous guest relations staffer, Ashan, everything changed.  He found a large room with a sitting area and a huge terrace and plenty of space to move around and to hang clothes.  The room had a ceiling fan which the previous room did not.  The bed was comfortable but the curtains had holes in them as if moths had eaten them and they were half hanging off their rails.  The bed side tables were useless - no drawers  and  inadequate space for night needs.  There was a good desk and good enough lighting.  Great shower.  The room needs a make over and new furniture and curtains.

Great bar staff at the pool bar who were very helpful when it started raining.  We read into Ashan a number of times; he gave us great advice of things to do in Galle itself and wanted to know about our experience of the hotel.  He’s a real asset.","Great food; a stunning pool; but needs a serious make-over.","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r1004180665-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","54","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericmS1726FO","Eric M","289D6C83ED8CDC112EAA2FB88859DB12",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","ericmS1726FO"

Positives: 1) Well located (short drive to Galle town, nice Hotel beach). 2) Rooms are spacious, air conditioning worked well. 3) Nice lobby, lounge area. 4) Staff were helpful, e.g we were allowed to use the lounge past our checkout time to freshen up (shower etc).  5) Pool area very good. 6)  cultural evening on Avrudu day was good. 7) good discounts for amex holders/radisson members on food.

Development points: 1) Buffet food did not compare to other hotels we stayed at on this holiday (e.g Kingsbury, Habarana Village). Also I stayed here when it was an Amari Hotel, food was superior back then. Small issues like no Prawns at the buffet at all. The only caveat was that on the day of the Avrudu celebration, the food stations were very good. 2) Need a better solution for coffees/teas near the pool. If you are not full board, one could end up spending £3-4 on machine coffee every time. 3) Buffet should be organised in a clearer fashion. I.e someone should be at the front noting down room number and then another person taking the group of guests to the table. 

Taking the above into consideration it was a pleasant stay but not worth the elevated prices we paid during the Sri Lankan new year period. If the food and buffet experience was improved then the Radisson Blu would be a one of the strongest Hotels in the region (in my humble opinion).","3 night stay - lots of positives but food left us disappointed..","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r1003037095-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","60","53","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32ishana","32ishan","2F9F24F67E1E2923A88DEA6AF4FCE118",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","32ishana"

We went on a whale watching tour, explored Galle (about 15 mins drive away), visited the local restaurants (go to Luuma!), surfed at Ahikava School, visited Dalawella beach (wild turtles swimming) and went to a turtle release at Koggala at sunset! :)

The breakfast was lovely with a big selection including personalised omelettes. The pool area is lovely and right next to the beach! There were plenty of cocktails and drinks options!
You need to try their local Arrack it was lovely. There's a few side-of-the-pool meal options too for a reasonable price. There's a few cute cats that roam around too and we spotted a land monitor lizard a couple times too! They stay out of your way though if you don't like them.

Ajith deserves a special mention as the towel guy who made sure we were all happy every day and knew where our go-to spot was. Thilini the guest experience curator was also lovely and was super helpful to arrange a bouquet of flowers and room decorations for our Mothers Day! (Rs 11,500 for the flowers)

On the other side, we have been fortunate to stay in a few 5 star hotels and we didn't feel it met the same standards as the others. The rooms need a bit of TLC as they looked outdated compared to the website photos. We also had a recurring issue of our rooms being cleaned but our towels not being replaced (so was left with no towels every evening until we phoned reception and had some delivered). There also are apparently activities every day but when we went to a few, we were told they weren’t operating like the cooking class and beach volleyball. But apart from this it was a lovely stay, thank you!","Lovely 4 star stay!!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r1001485480-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","8","49","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ssoph9","Sophie","AEFA9C3A3F3C5DA12C85D4F531C940D0",,,,,"Ssoph9"

More like 4.5/5. I don't give 5/5 often for 5 star hotels as I expect a lot. Firstly, the service from start to finish was excellent, the only exception being being a very late room servicing. Our room was large, very clean, great AC with a well appointed spacious bathroom. Nice sea views and a usable balcony. The pool area is nice, quite large with various seating areas including cabanas which always get reserved early in the morning, around the pool. The pool bar does food, which was very handy, good quality and decent value. For dinner, there is a buffet, or you could eat at the rooftop bar, which would be extra to half board. There are also various other options at the other restaurant. I would normally knock off a point for any 5 star hotel doing a dinner buffet, but their buffet was actually pretty good. Lots of variety, all hot and also a cooking station or two. The desserts were excellent. The rooftop bar is definitely worth a visit, especially around sunset. Overall, a very nice package.","Very nice stay 4.5/5","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r1000212817-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","175","294","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scarboroughmark","Scarboroughmark","F26D8F3C1FE01124325F79E0AF24AB4C",,"190744","Scarborough, United Kingdom","Scarborough","Scarboroughmark"

We stayed for three nights in one of the modern electric blue beehive rooms. The views from the balcony were spectacular, but the room’s design had some frustrating flaws. For example, the bedside reading light switch was inconveniently placed, requiring you to get out of bed to turn it off. Similarly, reaching the toilet paper from the seat was awkwardly difficult.

I had expected scenic hill paths for pre-dinner strolls, but unfortunately, the surroundings don’t offer much in that regard. Additionally, be prepared for long drives—most tourist attractions are at least one to two hours away by car each way.

That said, as with all six hotels we stayed at in southern Sri Lanka, the staff were warm, gentle, and often proactive in their service.","A hotel in midst of expansion","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r993827443-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gour2024","Gou R","4B19AD77AAF3FA792E41F8808BCD1DE7",,,,,"gour2024"

From the first reveal from reception to our last sunrise vista from our Bee Hive, we were wowed by the breathtaking views which reach beyond the Lake in Udawalawa, from where I am now writing this review. We experienced almost every type of weather over the four days and even when it was pouring with rain the view was stunning.

We really enjoyed the traditional welcome, and the Bee Hive cabanas with our private views. As I’d expected from the advert they are a bit querky  but very comfortable with everything you need & the views are amazing.

Service and food at the restaurant, where we ate a lot were very high and all of the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed our local gin & tonics at the bar before dinner.

Our four nights allowed us some downtime after a busy trip but there are interesting places to visit like the Dambatenne Tea Factory, Lipton’s Seat and Bambarakanda waterfall.","The Widest Views of Sri Lanka from a Bee Hive.","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r990743757-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",,"1526","61062398","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/a3/bc/fe/nigel-p.jpg","1609","10","89","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nigelp838","Nigel P","6069C31D023765AE797C14B661F8056E",,"187439","Marbella, Spain","Marbella","nigelp838"

Dit is een zeer centraal gelegen hotel waarbij je heel wat uitstappen kan plannen.  Vanaf deze locatie hebben we Anaradhapura, Lion Rock, Pollonaruwa, Kaudulla National Park bezocht.  
De kamers zijn voldoende groot om met 2 personen te verblijven. Samen met onze dochter van 17 hadden we dan ook 2 kamers vastgelegd.  Enige nadeel van dit hotel is de locatie vlak aan de straat, die nogal druk gebruikt wordt. Wij sliepen op slechts enkele meters van de straat waardoor we 's nachts het gevoel hadden dat de voertuigen door de kamer reden.
Zwembad in het hotel is leuk en meer dan voldoende om in af te koelen.
We hebben in dit hotel ontbeten en eenmaal 's avonds gegeten.  Ontbijt is afhankelijk van het aantal gasten ofwel een buffet (goed) ofwel van de kaart bestellen. Daar hebben we het nadeel ondervonden dat een aantal gerechten van de kaart niet aanwezig waren.  Dit is jammer, vooral omdat je toch voor de ontbijtformule kiest.
Het avondeten was goed, ik heb enorm genoten van de aangeboden Sri Lanka curry schotel, zeer lekker.  De andere avonden hebben we gekozen om elders te eten omwille van de vele mogelijkheden in de omgeving.
Tijdens ons verblijf werden we steeds opgewacht en vriendelijk begroet door het personeel van het hotel.  Geen vraag was te veel om op te lossen. Zo hadden we de eerste avond geen warm water. Even gemeld en probleem werd direct opgelost.  
Het personeel is zeer gedienstig, enkel zou het handig zijn mochten ze de Engelse taal iets beter beheersen.  Vooral tijdens de bediening in het restaurant zijn er wat al te vaak misverstanden rond wat we bestellen.
Hoedanook, een goed hotel (prijs/kwaliteit) op een toplocatie om heel wat leuke uitstappen te organiseren.
Bedankt voor de gastvrijheid.","Goede uitvalsbasis, maar niet perfect.","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d11979805-r1003589623-EKHO_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","21","94","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92SamM92","Sam M","C57E76C0D2AA84AFBC53C16F9A1AF8E2",,"2030826","Kapellen, Belgium","Kapellen","92SamM92"

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay with us. While we’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the location, Sri Lankan cuisine, your suite’s view, and the pool experience, we’re truly sorry to learn that certain aspects of your stay did not meet expectations.

Location is good. Food is very good if it is Sri Lankan.  Western foods are ok at best. However guest to staff ratio is inadequate for this price point.  Also, staff need’s training for more professionalism.  Mistakes were made in room service orders and had to call multiple times to get toilet paper.  Also departments such as housekeeping don’t answer the phone.  

Also only lobby, main restaurant and rooms are air conditioned. Rest of the hotel is hot.

Also crows and a cat was roaming in the open bar area.

Is the Spa treatments were good but more care and warmth is needed when interacting with customers.

At first glance hotel looks very nice but once you stay for a while you notice the deficiencies.

We had a Suite for 3 days.  Suite it self was very functional and had a very nice view.

First of all, the staff. So warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind – they made us feel like valued guests, not just another booking. Always ready with a smile, helpful tips, and nothing ever felt like too much trouble. It’s rare to come across hospitality this thoughtful and effortless.

The breakfasts? Incredible. A proper highlight of each day. Fresh fruit, flaky pastries, great coffee, and something new to try every morning. You could tell everything was prepared with care – it felt more like a homemade spread than a standard hotel buffet.

And then there’s the pool area – absolute bliss. Clean, spacious, and beautifully designed with plenty of loungers and shady spots. We spent hours there just unwinding, with the occasional dip in the crystal-clear water.

All in all, this place completely exceeded our expectations.

Their customer service was amazing, especially the manager (can’t remember his name) who spoke very good English. Helped us with a few transfer challenges with our company doing the translating etc. 

We were welcomed with a drink on arrival and swiftly helped to our room. Our house keeper was great fun, checked on us and left us pretty towel displays on the bed to make us feel welcome. Room was lovely, had a fantastic view with our balcony.

The bar service was also very good as was all inclusive buffet, lots of choice and 

We would say it did get a bit busy and felt crowded for evening dinners. They have small bands playing music round the tables though that’s a special touch.  

The swimming pool was also very nice and well kept by facilities. It is a good style and well placed to capture the sun in this woodland space. Views surrounding are lovely, it’s very serene. 

I think our two comments for consideration would be swimming pool drinks and service was a bit hard to order and took a while to come as it had to come from restaurant/bar. 

It was ideal for us in between locations but it’s a bit far out from main Kandy and you can’t walk to the main places.

Many thanks for your Review followed by your recent stay with us. We are highly regretted that we did not hear from you regarding your concerns during the stay. We carried out a through investigation including of the observation of CCTV footage and were unable observe any issue at the Main Restaurant during your stay period. Furthermore, it was noted that the guests were having meals after the stipulated closing time, until around 10.15 A.M (daily) since we are always flexible on that understanding that all our guests are  on Holiday. However, there is a maximum in the extra time that we can allow since the Restaurant needs to be made ready for the next meal by cleaning and laying out a new set up in order to arrange the food  services for the next meal. We always try to deliver a great experience to all our guests as stated by many other guests on  this platform and we regret that your expectations were not met.

The room we had was on the third floor with wonderful views of the grounds and sea. It was very spacious with all of the accessories you need.
The hotel and grounds were kept spotlessly clean despite the fact at times the hotel was full to capacity. The restaurant buffet catered for all tastes and was extensive and delicious. Whilst being very busy at times the buffet was always being topped up.

Or just ask Harsha / Dixon, they were superb",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Radisson Blu hosted my (then fiancée, now wife) and me for our traditional Tamil Saiva wedding on the beach and our reception. They were nothing short of amazing. In the lead-up, we were quite anxious, having opted for only a partial wedding planner, but the team truly went above and beyond to accommodate our every need. From promptly pressing our clothes to ensuring I (the groom) was fed and hydrated throughout what felt like days of photoshoots, they handled everything with care and professionalism.

The rooms were spotless, and every request was met with efficiency. The team made this an unforgettable experience for us, and I will forever be grateful for how they brought our vision to life. A special thanks to the chefs for creating the most incredible food, catering to all our palates. I am not a big veg guy myself but the wedding menu Chef Singh prepared for us was truly mouthwatering, not to mention his breakfast dosas. I’m also extremely grateful to Angelo, Harsha, Dixon, Chamika and the entire team (including the front-of-house staff, whose names I may have missed-sorry!) for their warmth and hospitality. Not only were they brilliant hosts, but they also took the time to genuinely build connections with us. Their dedication was truly awe-inspiring, and I cannot praise them highly enough for alleviating any stress we had. Sajard also for helping get all of this over the line and regularly checking in with me throughout even whilst managing three locations.

A special shoutout to Asanka—the best pastry chef around!

Thank you all. We genuinely hope to see you again!

The room was clean and spacious and the super efficient and friendly pool staff ensured we had ample supplies of beach towels as we sat around the pool.

The dining was great, as were indeed the dining staff who were super efficient and friendly. However, my wife got bored of the Indian cuisine that was always on offer (although I loved it and thought it was superb!).

Two things we did not like. 

1. We paid for an all inclusive package (including drinks) but had to involve management early on when we were told by the bar staff that we had to pay for drinks outside of the restaurant, ie at the roof top terrace bar (which is stunning by the way) and the pool bar. Although this matter was quickly resolved, it was hassle we did not need.

2. We thought the pool staff were intimidated by a rowdy/noisy group of Polish and Russian guests who tended to monopolise, (and drink too much), in and around the pool and surrounding areas most afternoons. 

The hotel is located 10 minutes from Galle in a tuktuk which costs approx. USD5 each way so is well located. It took approx. two hours to travel by taxi each way to Colombo International Airport.","A Great Stay...But....","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d10954536-r998663535-Radisson_Blu_Resort_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"150","19594652","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2a/fd/9c/avatar.jpg","150","75","79","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Comet4B","Comet4B","B01C18FA77F870AC06AE1DA06BB0B265",,,,,"Comet4B"

It was 100% a wonderful stay!

From service, to location, to food everything was on point. I think it was definitely one of the best experiences I’ve had in Sri Lanka.

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. They were always ensuring our stay was absolutely pleasant which I have not experienced in any other hotel. Food was really really yum and the portion sizes were so filling. For each meal I was extremely full that I could go into a food coma. Thinking about it makes me hungry. The rooms were very comfortable and each room had a beautiful view of the mountains and lakes for miles and miles. 

It’s definitely the place to getaway from the hustle and bustle, for peace and tranquility. I hope I get the opportunity to return Dream Cliff Mountain Resort again and will be recommending this place to all my friends and family.","Definitely A Dream Stay","2024-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1961272-d19126810-r952678433-Dream_Cliff_Mountain_Resort-Beragala_Uva_Province.html",,"450","561441580","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/76/eb/2c/caption.jpg","450","7","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845rashmij","Rashmi J","6351E5989B9E6D71C357DD93297517C3",,,,,"845rashmij"

La vue
La vue est superbe y compris depuis les bungalows

Les chambres
L’idée des bungalows isolés en forme de ruche est bonne sur le principe. Par contre peu ou pas d’isolation entre la partie chambre et la partie salle de bain/toilette….bonjour l’intimité.
La décoration des chambres manque cruellement de goût.. mais c’est effectivement une histoire de goût.

Le service
Le personnel est très gentil est accueillant mais pas au niveau attendu pour le prix payé.
De plus on avait demandé à l’hotel de nous réserver des billets de train pour un voyage 2eme classe reserved seats. Il nous ont facturé une somme indécente pour le service rendu et nous n’avons pas obtenu les billets demandés. Ce qui nous a laissé la désagréable impression de nous être fait flouer.
Nourriture du restaurant et du petit déjeuner de faible qualité et sans saveur. La viande est souvent trop cuite.
Dans l’ensemble, le prix demandé pour cet hotel est beaucoup trop élevé pour le niveau de service délivré.

Both stays were too short, the first one was coming from airport and leaving next morning on a bus, second coming in the evening by train and leaving at 4AM for the airport. Next time we hope to stay longer and really savour the experience. I am not sure how much we paid (tour group), but it was worth every penny and much more. Treated like family from the moment you get down from the bus. Excellent spacious rooms. Quick elevators. Enough power outlets. Bathroom was superlative. View of course!! Indian ocean across the road, rail track and beach. The 1st floor restaurant is all glass, looking out on the ocean. Excellent Buffet the first night and next morning. The second night, it was past 9pm and they gave us a Set Menu which was also excellent.  And when they found out we had to leave at 4AM they OFFERED to give us packed breakfasts, choice of veg or non-veg. Made fresh at 4AM, sandwiches, cup of fruit and a bottle of water. Everyone I said that to, said ""Wow! THAT is hospitality!"" Their motto is ""Work Hard and Be Nice to People"" and they really live up to that and more. We felt that we were leaving old friends, when we checked out. Really hope to be back. In some 60 years of wandering the planet, I cannot think of a handful of hotels that were this memorable. What would I want changed? Nitpicking here, but Vattalappam as I remember from the 1960s was less spongy, more coconut milk and jaggery flavor. Maybe time has distorted my memory, but that was one of my Must-Haves, and they had that as option the last night Set Menu. With the Buffet you don't have space on plate or tummy for much of this.","""Work Hard and Be Nice To People"" is their motto and how they live up to it!!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d5892306-r992190856-Mirage_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","1","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass46162538605","Compass46162538605","9CC3DAA9BF62FAA9AA246AB024ECFBA0",,,,,"Compass46162538605"

However the breakfast wasn't great (compared to other hotels) and the towels in both of our rooms were thin/threadbare.

As others have said - the climb up to the hotel is incredibly steep - not an issue for us but not ideal if you have mobility issues, and the hotel's shuttle stops at 7pm.

It’s only a short walk downhill to the center of Ella with its cozy cafés and shops, but be prepared for a steep climb back. Luckily, the hotel offers a convenient shuttle service during the day, which we happily used.

We had already visited an elephant sanctuary and saw 2 elephants driving to Yala so of course we really wanted to see a leopard. Obviously wild life is completely unpredictable but we had booked the exclusive safari package which other than your own private jeep means absolutely nothing. We paid 405 USD for a nights stay in a tent which had more animals than the park in it (including a big enough lizard), mediocre dinner where you couldn’t see what you were eating, disgusting breakfast and of course the “private” safari. Our “guide” didn’t even introduce himself so I don’t know his name which straight away gave me a bad vibe. He didn’t give much information about anything - we saw deer, rabbits and millions of birds but it’s nothing we can’t see at home for free. We spent 3 hours driving around bumpy roads for absolutely nothing. We got a tip about a leopard and there was about 50 other jeeps and we could barely see the leopard he was so far up in the tree but still can say we saw one atleast. We were so happy to be leaving after one night it was more than enough. As I said wildlife is unpredictable but I really wouldn’t recommend this and if you are tight on budget and considering skipping it do! We went to the elephant freedom project for 1/10 of the price and had a lovely day with so much interaction with elephants!","Bird watching NOT safari.

Absolutely first class. You are greeted with smiles, warmth and treated like you are the only guests in the hotel.   The hotel  itself is older in style, right by the ocean, in large, well kept grounds.  Public areas are spacious and airy, with attractive Sri Lankan decor. The rooms ( we booked a deluxe for 4 weeks ) were attractive, ours was very comfortable. Nice bed linen and towels. Plenty of hot water,  good pressure in the shower and quality toiletries. Great facilities, large well maintained pool  with swim up bar and extensive sun bathing areas.  There are also indoor lounges and bar areas which offer evening entertainment, plus a spa.  The food was varied, always something we could eat -  good local fresh fruits;  huge range of salads;   hot western style food of all kinds;  amazing desert display plus delicious Sri Lankan and sometimes Indian specialty dishes. The location allows you to explore more of Sri Lanka.  We also wanted  a relaxing getaway from the colder European winter and it certainly delivered on that. There are a few local bars and shops close by.  The sea was quite wild when we were there and the sound of the waves against the shore was incredible.

Пляжа ,как такового, нет, но когда успокаивается шторм, подход к океану хороший и плавать комфортно. Познакомились с местным гидом Амаль, очень отзывчивый,неплохо говорит на русском языке. Ездили с ним на сафари в парк Яла, все прошло отлично! Возил на своём тук-туке по местным достопримечательностям. Вот его вотсап +94-71-309-87-78.

My birthday co-insided with our stay and the staff made a real effort in the room which really made it a special day and the evening meal was accompanied with a birthday cake and a burst of Happy Birthday a lovely touch indeed. Our room overlooked the pool and sea and despite the overcast conditions which were unexpected during our stay we managed to make the most of the facilities using the free half hour massage which was excellent though I did not get a chance to use the gym which was very well equipped indeed. Meals were generally quite good although the dining room was very busy at breakfast and dinner where there were little manners on show by many of the guests and the high expectation of the dress code I had read about prior to traveling was non-existent so do not worry about bringing too many pairs of long trousers guys as you will not need to wear them as I had expected! The room was very nice and spacious, you may need a few extra hangers but everything else is supplied and the room staff including the evening check by the housekeeping team was a nice touch were excellent and the room was kept to a very high standard ..well done! my only issue was the mattress which was very hard as I did not have a full nights sleep throughout the stay there though I did not complain as everything else was great. Entertainment at night was good but such a shame it was not better supported where the artists were excellent with possibly the exception of the magician. I must say we were pleasantly surprised to find we were allowed two glasses of wine each with our lunch and dinner a real bonus when we were not expecting this treat!

Thank you for sharing your experience and for appreciating the safari, the atmosphere, and the service provided by our team. We're pleased to hear that you enjoyed the wildlife encounters and the overall ambience of the camp.

However, we are sorry to learn about the loss of your valuables. While we understand how distressing this must be, we must respectfully clarify our position on this matter.

During your stay, our Guest Relations Officer provided a comprehensive welcome briefing. This included a clear explanation that the tents are not equipped with safety lockers, as they cannot be locked like hotel rooms. The briefing was translated to your group by one of your companions who understood English, ensuring that everyone was informed.

We also made it clear that safety lockers are available in the welcome area, which is clearly visible and accessible to all guests. Unfortunately, you chose not to use this facility. Additionally, at check-out on the 24th, when asked if all belongings were accounted for, you confirmed that everything was in order.

It was only on the 26th of August, through your tour agent, that we were informed of the missing items. Moreover, you confirmed that your valuables were last seen just before your departure from the camp, and from that moment, all bags were under your care and confirmed that everything was in order before your departure.

As a responsible company, we took immediate action by thoroughly checking the premises and questioning our staff. Our head of operations has been in touch with your tour agent, Jayamali, and provided all the necessary details regarding this situation.

While we cannot take responsibility for the loss of your valuables, we hope that this experience will not overshadow the positive memories of your stay.

Thank you again for your feedback.

He also arranged transport out of the camp by a local driver which was helpful. Much appreciated. Overall all the staff try their best to make guests comfortable. 

Safari was well guided and driven by driver Samantha and naturalist Dilhara, whom I spent most of my time with on private safari. Managed to spot leopards on some safaris but on others we couldn't spot any at all.

Areas to improve: at Big Game Camp, it was communicated that amenties include shower gel and shampoo but only shampoo was provided. As a guy, thats ok as we are more flexible, but for ladies it will matter more and if communicated, it should be provided. Daily meals were randomly switched between locations within the campsite as well, which made guests like myself confused too.","Great stay with Raj & team","2024-08","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d1226088-r966426881-Mahoora_Tented_Safari_Camp_Yala-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougandklaire","doug","AEEEB85541924781CE29FECE4A00858E",,"294262","Singapore","Singapore","dougandklaire"

As you have deleted your previous review and our response, we are responding to this review again.

Thank you for choosing our property after extensive research (4 years of study according to your last review) and finding us capable of delivering a great experience. We deeply regret that your stay did not meet your expectations.

After thoroughly investigating the incident and speaking with our staff, we are puzzled by your dissatisfaction, particularly regarding our team's conduct. Even our sales colleague, Nathasha, who has been in close communication with you throughout, is at a loss as to why you felt our staff were rude.

While we apologize for your negative experience, we would like to address some of the points raised in your current review. We promptly attended to the concerns you raised, including the double payment issue due to miscommunication. Hence, we politely reject your statement that we have been dishonest. In fact, we checked you out without charging for the extras, trusting that you will make that payment after making any adjustments you need.

We appreciate your feedback and are committed to improving our services. We hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a better experience in the future.

When I first checked in I was immediately taken to the beautiful rooftop terrace for complimentary drinks while my luggage was taken to my room. The view of waterfalls, mountain ranges, and lush vegetation from the roof cannot be accurately expressed in words.

Beyond the hotel itself the staff now feel like friends after my 48 hour stay. Malith and Ruwan stood out as exemplary employees. When I woke up for breakfast they were there and remembered me by name. When I came back from my hike they made sure that I was comfortable despite the influx of new visitors.

After a long tuk tuk ride we were utterly charmed by the lovely decor, well kept facilities and warm and friendly staff. 

Regarding location, it was perfect for us because it was a short walk to Sigiriya Lion Rock, which is why we came to Sigiriya. 

After the hike, we had a super tasty breakfast at the hotel. We opted for the Sri Lankan breakfast and the chef actually came out to chat with my husband about his dietary restrictions and ensured he had something delicious for brekkie.

After breakfast we went into the pool, which was perfectly cool and in a shaded area. The pool area was clean and they provided towels on request. 

The room was beautiful and decorated in a classic SE Asian style. Very clean and tidy, and clearly well-kept.

The Ekho team were all super professional  and friendly; from the guard to reception to waitstaff and other team members, it was top notch customer service. This is supported by the fact that we had issues with our tuktuk and everyone without question came to help us out and get us safely on the road. I would highly recommend Ekho if what you’ve read ticks the boxes for what you are looking for.","Beautiful setting, top notch service and delicious food","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d11979805-r999392112-EKHO_Sigiriya-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",,"50","102602986","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/1d/98/ea/foodobsessive72.jpg","50","19","67","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodobsessive72","Foodobsessive72","CDB82F81FB39B708F42D61A1144F8D55",,"56225","Mansfield, Texas","Mansfield","Foodobsessive72"

Your 10/10 recommendation means the world to us, and we’ll be sure to share your appreciation with everyone mentioned. We wish you both a lifetime of happiness and look forward to welcoming you back for more beautiful memories in the future.

We were able to step out of our room through our balcony to a great pool ideal for cooling down on a hot sunny afternoon or watching children have fun swimming safely.There was even a swim up bar what more could you want

If you have really sweet tooth as my husband has variety of local -continental deserts and cakes are always available.Breakfast and dinner served as a buffet with separate pancake and waffles station.If you like to experience local and traditional dishes each morning and evening you could try it to . All stuff appreciated that we both try new things each day . Lunch was a game changer with a la cart menu that want repeat even once through our stay . Big shoutout to F&B manager who chatted with us each time around .Pest SPA for me in long time .Absolutely brilliant.Great pool ,very clean around and open for snacks and drinks throughout the day .

You are sheer magic! I come to Galle Fort and the main reason is to be with you. You are an experience that I could not forget from the time I first came 2yrs ago and one night with you wasn’t enough. Thus, I came to you again and will again and again every time I visit Srilanka. If anyone wants to experience peak colonial era energy and vibes they must take refuge within your warm embrace in the avatar of your amazing hospitality, smiling staffs and most importantly the love that exudes from each of the stay . It is truly magical how you take one back to a different time. Each nook and cranny whispers a story of its own. In the bustling heart of the Peddler’s street you are a coveted space that gave so much peace to a hustler like me who earns your presence in difficult days. Thank you ❤️

A special thanks to the entire team of The Bartizan especially to Mr.Andrew who is their ever smiling , witty manager . He will make sure you really feel at home , you are truly taken care of and feel so welcomed in this hotel. If you are reading this Andrew you are a sweetheart! We will be back again very soon!! Please keep this place oh so welcoming always!!

This boutique hotel is full of charm and character, offering an experience that far exceeds its rating.

We stayed in the Deluxe Ocean Front room, which was stunning. The room was spacious, the bathroom was modern and spotless, and the private balcony was the icing on the cake.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable. They accommodated our early travel schedule by packing us a breakfast to-go on the first day and served breakfast on our balcony the next.

Whether it's the front desk or the 24/7 security guard, you're always greeted with a warm smile.

The shared oceanfront terrace offers a spectacular view of the sunset — a perfect place to unwind.

Our room was a quirky one at the top of a spiral staircase with a fabulous outside space, and even more fabulous views. The bed was very comfortable and the shower great with complimentary toiletries, not to mention a view of the lighthouse.
Breakfast was perfect and plentiful, a fruit plate, toast and bread rolls and a cooked choice as well. They even catered specially for my fussy choices!

We appreciate you taking the time to leave yet another review.  However, we are disappointed to see the same concerns being posted across multiple platforms despite our previous response. While we respect your right to share feedback, repeatedly highlighting the same issues feels unfair, especially considering the efforts we made to address your concerns.

The Bartizan is over 200-year-old colonial property, carefully restored to balance modern comforts with its historic charm. We strive to provide clear and transparent information by detailing our rooms and amenities on third-party booking platforms within the parameters allowed. The ground floor courtyard room you booked is our most economical option, and all its features were accurately displayed before booking. While we understand that personal preferences vary, it is unfair to judge our hotel so harshly based on a misunderstanding of the type of property you booked.  

Regarding the used water bottles under the sink cabinet, we sincerely apologize. This was an oversight by our housekeeping team, as the bottles were inside a closed space. Had you mentioned this during your stay, we would have immediately addressed it, as guest satisfaction and cleanliness are top priorities for us.  

As for the wall patches you photographed, we acknowledge that they appear unfinished. Unfortunately, this was due to paint bubbling on the centuries-old walls, an ongoing challenge we continuously work to maintain. In this instance, the repair had not yet been fully completed before your arrival, and we regret that this affected your impression of the room.

Due to these concerns, we did provide you with a 50% refund as a goodwill gesture which you failed to mention in your review. Had you not used the room for the entire night and left your belongings inside until check out time next day, we would have even offered a full refund. Our team remained polite and accommodating throughout, ensuring that you were treated fairly.

We appreciate that you revised your rating in the first platform you posted, but we still find it disappointing that you have chosen to reiterate the same complaints multiple times despite the fair treatment you received. We encourage all future guests to carefully review our room descriptions and photos to ensure our boutique colonial property aligns with their expectations.  

Thank you again for your time, and we wish you all the best in your future travels.  

Best regards,  
The Bartizan Team ","1126","790562573","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1f/07/0d/caption.jpg","2000","1126","790562571","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1f/07/0b/caption.jpg","2000","1126","790562570","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1f/07/0a/caption.jpg","2000","1126","790561592","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1f/03/38/caption.jpg","2000","2000","790561515","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/1f/02/eb/caption.jpg","1126",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"77 Pedlar Street, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"77 Pedlar Street",,"11789132","6.025552","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.21601","The Bartizan Galle Fort","301","4.6","6","3","16","51","225","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d11789132-Reviews-The_Bartizan_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.thebartizan.com","2025-02-27","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","5","Cleanliness","1","Service","4",,,"This was probably not the best choice of hotel for us.

Firstly, all the hotels within the city walls have a certain configuration so you may not have the usual benefits of other hotels. Nonetheless, our stay at the Bartizan was a relaxing one. Although we had a partial view of the sea, the view was still nice to have and hearing the waves at night was very smoothing for me personally. 

The room was spacious enough for 2 people. It is very dimly lit and no TV is within the room. No lifts as well but I believe the other hotels within walls have the same layout. Coffee and tea were complimentary alongside the items inside the mini-bar, which was helpful in terms of not having to always buy water. Our room had a AC unit and an overhead fan.

There was an option to have breakfast on our balcony, which we took and proved to be very convenient. The staff very quickly cleaned up once we gave them a call. The staff were always very friendly and courteous, even offering us an umbrella to shade us from the fierce heat. They helped us check in smoothly and were accommodating to our needs. Andrew (who I believe was the hotel manager) always greeted us whenever we entered or left the hotel alongside the other staff members.

Located really close to the sea, all the main sites and restaurants are easily reachable from the hotel. A section of the Galle walls is right outside the hotel, so you can start your walk of them straight away.

I had a lovely stay in Galle and would recommend the hotel if you are staying for a short period, or even using it as a base to cover other sites close by.","A lovely setting for a 2-night stay.","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d11789132-r994851533-The_Bartizan_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"3264","316326559","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/da/c2/9f/firoz-u.jpg","2448","67","652","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firozu2018","Firoz U","20294382630F1CC0D19F98406B157940",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","firozu2018"

Dear madam Chantelle, Thank you for the wonderful review. It is sincerely appreciated. The courtyard rooms are smaller and yes they don't have windows. Windows cant be set into this particular design due to the heritage nature of the walls in the courtyard ground-floors. We will continue to find solutions for these requirements as best possible. There is always the alternative’s of the balcony rooms, Owners suite and family room together with the tower rooms which offer breezy windows and magnificent views. We invite you back to stay with us at the Hotel Bartizan the next you visit the Galle Dutch fort.

Il clima fresco è una meraviglia dopo il caldo del resto dello Sri Lanka, e rende il soggiorno ancora più rilassante. Bellissima anche la vista sulle montagne e sul verde circostante, soprattutto al mattino. Colazione e cena a buffet abbondanti e di qualità, con tanta varietà per tutti i gusti. Anche la spa e la piscina riscaldata sono un plus davvero apprezzato.

Il personale è sempre cordiale, professionale e disponibile ad aiutare per qualsiasi esigenza. Ottima anche la posizione, vicina al centro ma in zona tranquilla.

First must say that this is not our kind of hotel, too grand and ostentatious, we prefer boutique hotels. 
With a gold-plated elephant in the Reception and gold-plated adornments around the lobby we knew that this would not be our first choice. But having said that, it still is a great hotel and obviously caters for meetings and conferences (luggage x-ray scanner is reception says it's not just a vacation hotel)

Room was equally decorated and fitted to a high standard.

We did use the very small pool but felt too busy with 6 people in it.

Restaurant was huge and ornate with a very large selection of very good, tasty food, with a guitarist playing during the evening.

Staff were incredible as everywhere being super friendly and helpful","The grandest hotel on our trip around Sri Lanka.","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d21002799-r1011611681-Araliya_Red-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"3000","806972388","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/19/6b/e4/islandyoga1.jpg","3000","0","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandyoga1","islandyoga1","7C0B7E9478C23432E2B5C04BC511ADD6",,,,,"islandyoga1"

I visited Araliya Red with my husband, and our stay was amazing from the moment we arrived until we left. The warm welcome drink was perfect for the cold, rainy weather. Supun at the front office handled our reservation, and the check-in was very smooth.

We loved the hot pool – it was the best part! All the staff were friendly and helpful. The F&B team was professional and really cared for us during our stay.

They even arranged a lovely candlelight dinner for us, but sadly we couldn’t attend. However, they gave us the same special table for breakfast, which was so thoughtful.

Die positive Resonanz zu unserem vielfältigen All-Inclusive-Angebot und der reichhaltigen Auswahl an vegetarischen Speisen bestätigt unseren hohen gastronomischen Standard. Die einzigartige Lage unseres Resorts, wo der Bentota-Fluss auf den Indischen Ozean trifft, schafft perfekte Bedingungen für entspannte Momente am Wasser.

We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience of your recent visit to Occidental Eden Beruwala, A Member Of Barcelo Hotel Group.

Your comments mean a great deal to us, and we value your comprehensive review of your experience.

We extend our sincere apologies for the initial accommodation that did not meet your expectations and the subsequent bathroom maintenance issue. Our maintenance team has addressed these concerns to prevent future occurrences. The beachfront location, while picturesque, does experience natural tidal patterns and currents typical of river mouth areas, and we prioritize guest safety in our recommendations regarding water activities.

We are delighted that our team could promptly resolve the situation by providing you with an upgraded accommodation. The spacious suite with its premium amenities truly represents our commitment to guest comfort. Our culinary team takes great pride in preparing exceptional dishes for both breakfast and dinner service, and we are pleased these exceeded your expectations.

Finally, it brings us joy that you found tranquility by our swimming pool after your extensive travels, and that our attentive staff members delivered the high standard of service we strive to maintain.

We arrived to a warm welcome by the staff. When we were shown to our room, we found it to be slightly dated & it felt like a bit of an anticlimax from what we’d been used to during our trip to Sri Lanka. 

We realised quickly that the bath/shower set up leaked all over the bathroom floor. I raised this with reception & asked to move rooms. We then received an upgrade & the upgraded room was brilliant, it was like a completely different hotel. The staff couldn’t have done any more for us with regards to resolving this issue. 

The upgraded room was spacious & immaculately presented. The food during our evening meals & breakfast was fantastic. 

It was great to wind down & relax around the pool area after 10 days of travelling. 

The beach area was accessible, but the beach is situated on the mouth of a river. Probably not the most hygienic to be swimming in, the sea is notoriously choppy a lot of the time with strong currents from the river so it was sensible not to go any further than a paddle. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our time at Eden. Thank you for a lovely stay.","Lovely hotel, helpful staff.","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r1011278560-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",,"2048","713185925","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/82/5a/85/caption.jpg","2000","20","72","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanPatt96","Dpatt96","571E27A496D1A5E6A807F840CD945309",,"186335","Lincolnshire, United Kingdom","Lincolnshire","DanPatt96"

This five-star establishment is truly remarkable, offering breathtaking views of the sea based on my observations. The resort is blessed with an eco-friendly environment and boasts a stunning beachfront surrounded by lush greenery, alongside the awe-inspiring sight of the beautiful sea and a hillside monastery that we enjoyed during our stay at Eden. 
The hotel lobby is impressive, spacious, and impeccably clean, presented in a highly attractive manner. The young team at the front office works diligently, and we must commend them for their professionalism, attention to detail, and willingness to assist at any time. We received a wonderfully warm welcome from the hotel staff, who ensured our comfort throughout our stay from the very first day at this lovely establishment. The treatment we received from the hotel team was exceptional, and the rooms assigned to us exceeded our expectations; they were beautifully presented, spotless, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. My partner required extra care during this trip, and the hotel team consistently ensured she felt happy and comfortable, helping even before we asked for it. In my personal experience, the resort team is truly a **GEM**. 
Thank you, Rohan, Yohan, and your exceptional team—an incredible group of individuals, professional in their roles and attentive to detail, always humble and kind. The remarkable aspect of this team is their ability to remember guest preferences, making it impressive to witness how they care for their guests at Eden; it is truly an extraordinary experience. 
The fantastic food and beverage team at the hotel acts and thinks in alignment with their operational leaders, demonstrating excellent training; they are incredibly friendly, professional in their service, polite, and always willing to help. The housekeeping team maintained our rooms in pristine condition and ensured the hotel lobby area was well-kept and spotless. The main restaurant, Garden of Eden/Sippi, a new dining venue, offers an outstanding selection of high-quality meals. We enjoyed Sri Lankan Lamp Rice at Sippi on our first night, which was delightful with generous portions; the food spread at the main restaurant during our repeated stay was consistently delicious. 
The dining area boasts a great atmosphere, with a positive vibe evident during meal times. The food is exceptional and served in a hygienic manner to all guests. I must emphasise that excellent vegetarian options were available for guests. The restaurant service was extraordinary, with staff members exhibiting exceptional attention to detail, all of whom were friendly and polite at all times. Once again, thank you to GM Rohan, his fantastic team Yohan, the wonderful front office staff, Suresh, and his charming food and beverage team, Chef Deepal, Viraj, and his terrific team of chefs, who treated us with kindness and politeness. 
The hotel staff were highly professional, caring, and attentive to detail at all times. The standout feature of this entire hotel team is their commitment to exceeding guest expectations, always ensuring you have a superbly relaxed and enjoyable experience.","A Truly Unforgettable Experience at Eden Resort – Feels Like Coming Home again","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189172-d496617-r1009385037-Occidental_Eden_Beruwala-Beruwala_Western_Province.html",,"225","749171412","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/a7/72/d4/don2jako.jpg","225","18","696","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/don2jako","don2jako","32DEDD16E9F6A5304E579E87044C8E84",,"293961","Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka","don2jako"

Thank you for your detailed review and for choosing The Bartizan for your stay in Galle Fort. We truly appreciate your kind words about our location, breakfast, and, most importantly, our team. It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed the sea view from your suite and the sunsets from our roof terrace.  

We understand that some of the design elements of our heritage property, such as room layouts and furniture placement, may not suit all preferences. While we strive to cater to the needs of most of our guests, certain aspects reflect the unique character of The Bartizan, blending modern comforts with its historic charm. That said, your suggestions regarding room facilities, such as adding tables, hooks, and deeper shelves, are noted and will be reviewed for future updates.  

As for the paintwork and signs of aging, we are constantly working to maintain the property through regular touch-ups. However, being a heritage building within Galle Fort, some signs of age are inevitable and add to its character. Even so, we remain committed to ensuring our guests feel comfortable and welcome.  

We appreciate your feedback about obtaining a liquor license and other amenities. These suggestions are valuable as we continue to improve our services and facilities.

Everything is easily accessible from the hotel.
Our room (a suite) was spacious and comfortable, and had a great view of the sea. Much could be done to improve the facilities in the room. For example, a table or two, a surface for the fridge (one has to bend down to the floor to use it), more hooks to hang towels and clothes in the bathroom, a deeper shelf in the bathroom on which one might place a toiletry bag, shaver and so on. There were enough plug points! No TV, which is a good thing! It would be good if the hotel obtained a liquor licence and stocked a bar. There is a great little roof terrace from where on can see the sunset.
The whole place could do with a lick of paint, and the damp patches could be treated. Generally, the place is in need of some loving care, but it is still charming. Minor touches and improvements will make a big difference. 
Breakfast in the courtyard was great. Fruit of all kinds to start with followed by a choice of what one preferred; continental, Sri Lankan. Plenty of restaurants nearby for lunch and dinner: the hotel does not provide any meals after breakfast.
The staff were all tremendous; they were friendly and most helpful. All the best to Andrew and the team. I am sure the recent arrival of Andrew will make a big difference, and the place will improve.","A great little hotel","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d11789132-r980856251-The_Bartizan_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"50","343637782","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/7b/7f/16/nicholas-h.jpg","50","47","250","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholashP2288HV","Nicholas H","462AFF160C9B6C7601C6FFAF3ECA2FEB",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","nicholashP2288HV"

Its prime location provides easy access to the fort's ramparts and Pedlar Street, which is just around the corner. This makes it convenient for guests to explore the charming streets and cultural attractions of Galle Fort.

The rooms at The Bartizan Hotel offer a pleasing blend of modern comfort and historic charm. Each room is tastefully decorated, featuring elegant furnishings and thoughtful details that reflect the rich history of Galle. We stayed in a suite with a private balcony overlooking the ocean, providing a serene and picturesque setting. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. However, the air conditioner struggled to keep the room cool during the warm nights.

The hotel does not have a traditional restaurant, but a courtyard area with café tables serviced by a competent team in the kitchen. The food offers a delightful dining experience with a focus on fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Despite the lack of a formal restaurant, the culinary offerings were impressive and thoroughly enjoyable.

The service at The Bartizan Hotel is wonderful. The staff are warm, friendly, and go out of their way to ensure that every guest feels welcome and well taken care of. From personalized recommendations for local attractions to thoughtful touches throughout our stay, the level of hospitality was outstanding.

The Bartizan Hotel offers a unique and memorable experience in the heart of Galle Fort. The combination of its historic charm, luxurious accommodations, and outstanding service makes it a standout choice for anyone visiting Galle. Highly recommended for a truly special stay in a remarkable location.","Lovely Boutique Hotel in Galle","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d11789132-r960122328-The_Bartizan_Galle_Fort-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"2112","96507925","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/c0/98/15/cintrus.jpg","2816","38","99","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cintrus","Cintrus","C4AA07E0F6EF86D969D4E3BC7920DA79",,"255068","Brisbane, Australia","Brisbane","Cintrus"

It’s walking distance from all the restaurants, hardly a 2 min walk. Also it’s across the street from where u can walk/ view the ocean so location is brilliant. 
Our room was really spacious and well kept. Only suggestion I would have for them is to put another smaller air conditioner in the section with the 2 other beds as it’s quite hot there, coz ac air doesn’t reach. The balcony is of a nice size and loo is 👍👍
The breakfast was super. You have to order when u reach so that they can have it ready morning. It’s a small operation it seems..
A good thing to note is that once the kitchen is shut then there’s literally nothing for u to eat, which means by 4pm I think.. u need to get it from outside. They did say they serve lunch but I’m really not sure..
That said, it’s very very close to all the restaurants so manageable .

Only downside was that the property is popular for wedding/fashion photoshoots in the courtyard (where guests eat) and turret beside our room, and there were several such over our stay which we found intrusive.

The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and always ready to help—true Sri Lankan hospitality. One small area for improvement is the response time when calling the main operator (dialing 0); it sometimes took two or three calls to get through.

We had a truly wonderful stay here.  From the moment we arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and attentive to every detail. 
Even before We started our journey from India the team from hotel connected me and ask about all my preferences for our stay.
When we checked into the room it was immaculate, well-appointed, and offered a perfect balance of comfort and style. I especially appreciated the little touches—such as the complimentary refreshments, luxurious bedding, and thoughtful amenities and my preference a room close to elevator, non smoking and nice views - all have been taken care.

The hotel's location was ideal, making it easy to explore the surrounding area and adjacent to City Centre mall makes the place more attractive.
Breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious, with a great variety of options. The team at breakfast were very attentive and taken care of all our need.

The gardens are just beautiful, and we were lucky enough to wake early and wander down to watch the sunrise. It was calm, quiet, and absolutely breathtaking, a moment we won’t forget. I also joined the morning yoga session, which was such a refreshing way to start the day.

Dinner was delicious, amazing local Sri Lankan cuisine fresh, full of flavour, and made even better knowing so much of it came from their own garden.

Our room was private, spotless, and super comfortable. And then there’s the view… wow. Spectacular doesn’t even come close. You could sit and stare for hours.

Ekho Ella did not disappoint. We are sad to leave. I can’t remember the last time I felt this relaxed. The pictures on their site do not do this hotel justice. Make sure to catch a sunrise with yoga session overlooking the canyon to start your day. Breakfast, either local or western will surely satisfy your cravings. Hats off to Umesh and the other servers. Amazing service all day long. The staff is always smiling with a friendly atmosphere and helpful tips to explore this gem of an area.  The first night at dinner had a fantastic flute player who had a wide array of flutes from around the world. Rooms are clean and have a unique train station theme. Room 105 was perfect. Small comfy patio with a million dollar view. I can’t say enough about how amazing our stay was. I only wish we had more time.

What stood out just as much as the view was the service...5-star care in a boutique hotel. Seni, the manager, was always present but never intrusive. He ensured even the smallest details—like getting the coffee just right—were handled with precision.

Priyatha at the front desk checked in on us throughout the stay, making sure everything ran smoothly. And Sjwani, who served us daily, truly went the extra mile. My wife’s vegetarian meals were made exactly to preference, and baby food was thoughtfully arranged without reminders.

The chefs are more than willing to go the extra mile to prepare meals tailored to your preferences.

A special mention to Mr. Kavindu, who went above and beyond during our stay—when my partner injured his foot upon arrival, he was the first to offer first aid and continued to check in on us throughout our two-day visit. It truly felt like being cared for by family.

The hotel photos online are also very accurate, and we were genuinely impressed by the cleanliness and high standards when we checked in.

A big thank you to the young lads who drove us up and down the driveway — they were always patient, friendly, and reliable. The hotel is a little set back from the main road, so it's worth allowing about 15 minutes each way, but the team were always happy to assist with transport, which made it easy.

The views from the hotel were absolutely stunning, offering a tranquil escape and a perfect place to unwind.

As we were leaving, the team surprised us with some fresh bananas from their garden — such a thoughtful gesture, and they were absolutely delicious. A small touch that summed up the warmth and hospitality of our stay.

From the moment we arrived, we were charmed by the greenery surrounding the property, felt like stepping into a peaceful paradise. It even rained heavily on our first day, which added to the charm and made the scenery even more magical the next morning.
The bungalow was spacious of 2 stories, comfortable, and beautifully designed. There are only four bungalows on the property, which makes the atmosphere very private and serene. 
What really stood out was the team running the place. Though small and long working hours, they were super friendly, attentive, and professional. Everything from check-in to meals was handled with such care.
Speaking of meals, the food was delicious! Every dish we had was fresh and full of flavor. they do breakfast on tray basis and not buffet since the number of guest are limited.

The rooms were spacious and comfortable with a beautiful view, peaceful and in the cabins, it felt like you were the only people in the mountains. 

The restaurant was stunning, staff attentive and food delicious. It was particularly special for breakfast. We enjoyed the variety of Sri Lankan and international cuisines. 

The pool was also very stylish and clean but it is down quite a few steps so be prepared! 

However, the a main downfall was the access road - about 15 minutes along a very bumpy track from the main road. There is a shuttle van which hotel staff are happy to take you back and forth to the main road but this does make it feel slightly restrictive as you can’t pop out and grab a Tuk Tuk! In the van it is more comfortable but in a pre arranged Tuk Tuk or regular taxi it is quite uncomfortable. It is personal preference whether the remoteness is worth it or you want more things to do from the doorstep.

L’accueil est chaleureux et raffiné. 
Nous voyageons avec nos 2 grands enfants donc nous avions un chalet très agréable. 
La vue était un peu encombrée de la pollution indienne ( paraît-il) c’est dommage mais cela lui donnait un air mystérieux dont nous avons profité. 
Nous avons malgré tout pu profiter de la piscine très belle et agréable. 
Le Dîner n’est pas mal. 
Nous nous sommes levés tôt pour voir le lever du soleil qui était beau
Le petit déjeuner était très bon et varié.

The hotel is in an amazing location and I was able to watch the sunrise from my balcony. Breakfast was amazing and I felt spoilt with the service.  Hotel staff were amazing and I was offered drinks on my balcony one afternoon but a delightful young waiter. 
But, location is  quite remote and 10 minutes down a rough track, I relied on the hotel shuttle to take me to meet my driver and so felt a little restricted. Also I wasn't in a chalet but took the twin room next to reception which was lovely except it was at times a bit noisy from kitchen below and reception.  As it's a small property the restaurant issued a daily 4 course evening menu with 2 choices per course, disappointed with the options as would have preferred a more traditional Sri Lankan menu rather than the western choices, I couldn't eat one meal as the steak was so tough, luckily I wasn't too hungry that night but did have to let the staff know.

vielen Dank für Ihren Besuch und Ihre Rückmeldung.

Es erfüllt uns mit Freude, dass Sie erneut eine großartige Zeit in unserem Occidental Eden Beruwala erlebt haben.

Dennoch bedauern wir, dass unser Angebot am Nachmittag nicht ganz Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat und nehmen Ihre Anregung für Kaffee und Kuchen gerne auf. Zudem verstehen wir, dass die Eignung unseres Hotels für Familien mit Kindern subjektiv variieren kann und wir respektieren Ihre Meinung hierzu.

Wir freuen uns sehr, dass Sie die Großzügigkeit und Sauberkeit unserer Zimmer sowie den freundlichen und zuvorkommenden Service unseres Zimmerservicepersonals schätzen. Dass Reparaturen schnell und effizient durchgeführt werden, ist ein wichtiger Teil unseres Services, und wir sind stolz darauf, dass dies von Ihnen positiv hervorgehoben wurde. Ihr Lob an Mr. Lasantha vom Housekeeping wissen wir zu schätzen und werden es gerne weiterleiten.

Abschließend möchten wir Ihnen für die Anerkennung der Qualität unseres Essens und die positive Rückmeldung zu unseren Restaurant- und Barmitarbeitern danken. Das Wohl unserer Gäste liegt uns am Herzen und das regelmäßige Nachfragen, ob alles zu Ihrer Zufriedenheit ist, gehört zu unserem Standard. Die Empfehlung unserer All-Inclusive-Option freut uns besonders, da wir stets bestrebt sind, unseren Gästen ein hervorragendes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu bieten.

Wir möchten Ihnen nochmals unseren Dank für diesen liebenswürdigen Bericht über unser Hotel aussprechen und freuen uns, Sie in Zukunft wieder bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen.

An dieser Stelle möchten wir uns besonders bei Mr. Lasantha vom Housekeeping für seinen engagierten Einsatz bedanken.

Das Essen ist gut, allerdings wäre es wünschenswert, am Nachmittag zusätzlich Kaffee und ein Stück Kuchen angeboten zu bekommen.
Der Restaurantkapitän Mr. Nuwan, Herr Tharusha Dilshan aus der Küche sowie Mr. Sangeeth (F&B Manager) erkundigten sich regelmäßig, ob alles zu unserer Zufriedenheit sei.

Auch die Poolbar ist hervorragend – das Personal dort ist ebenso stets freundlich und aufmerksam.

Einen Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel empfehlen wir vor allem mit der Option ""All Inclusive"", da alkoholische Getränke im Hotel – wie übrigens in ganz Sri Lanka – recht teuer sind.

The hotel would have been impressive in its prime, but the rooms definitely need an update. Food for breakfast and dinner was great spread and quite tasty - commendation to the chef and food staff. Pool was picturesque and refreshing to swim in. Location was quite good and convenient for travel across the major attractions. Staff were accomodating and receptive to our requests. 

Rooms were comparable with 3 star establishments - with some damages on floor, tv channels not working properly and bathroom straight from 80’s. Even the doors seemed to not close unless pulled very hard.  Please look to expedite the room renovations - as we stayed in 6 5 star hotels across Sri Lanka on our trip - and this hotel was unanimously the least favourite due to the rooms. 

If the rooms can be addressed, I think hotel has all the right ingredients for success well into future.","Great food, facilities but rooms need renovation","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r1003589746-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"453","102216628","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/17/b3/b4/joel-v.jpg","604","11","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoelV502","Joel V","A0AF0CCCDCC8C09F0E311D3C224299E4",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","JoelV502"

A special shout-out to Nadeesha, our stewardess, who took such great care of us throughout the brunch. Her warm and attentive service truly enhanced our dining experience.

Highly recommend Uyana if you're looking for a quality dining experience in Kandy – whether it’s a special occasion or just a relaxing meal. We’ll definitely be back!

A special shoutout to Nipun at reception—his hospitality and professionalism were truly outstanding, making my stay even more enjoyable. Thank you to the entire team for a wonderful experience.

L’ultima notte c’è stato brutto tempo con pioggia a quanto pare quando piove vengono fuori delle farfalle notturne giganti (un invasione) male di poco se ti chiudi all’interno ma purtroppo per la nostra stanza non era sufficiente chiudersi perché la porta finestra aveva fessure ben evidenti che accoglievano numerose farfalle, abbiamo chiamato per cercare di correggere la situazione e l’unica cosa che hanno fatto è stata pulire il pavimento da quelle che erano morte e dirci di spegnere la luce ma così non si poteva dormire, allora io e il mio compagno ci siamo armati di ingegno e mettendo carta in queste fessure siamo riusciti a contenere l’invasione.
In seguito poi, avevamo scelto di pagare giorno per giorno e arrivati alla fine ci hanno ripresentato tutto il conto precedente, abbiamo fatto  presente che avevamo già pagato ma insistevano che non fosse vero e abbiamo dovuto portare la ricevuta (fortuna che l’avevamo conservata), insomma una situazione un po’ scomoda!!

My room was clean, and bed very comfortable. Overall, this is all very acceptable and the staff are excessively helpful and attentive which can't be faulted.

The location is very good albeit up a steep hill from the main street thronging with restaurants.

There are some challenges that would, otherwise, make this a luxury experience... selecting TV channels on the two remotes is clunky; there is no chair in the room other than a beanbag, so lounging on the bed is the only option; there's no luggage stand, so leaving open luggage on the floor is not ideal with occasional creepy crawlies around; the light switch is not within reach of the bed; the hot water for the shower never gets beyond tepid which is ok given the hot weather; shower gel and soap is limited to one small plastic bottle and a tiny hand soap which doesn't compare to modern luxury hotels offering refillable shower and hand gel; drinking water is limited to two small bottles during your stay unless you ask for more (they are very accommodating).

So, while this independent hotel is lovely and welcoming, and a cut above most local options in Ella, it's not quite a polished luxury experience if that's what you're expecting. Overall I'd recommend Hotel Onrock as a great Ella option though.","Yes, the view is great!","2024-10","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d7760464-r972538093-Hotel_Onrock-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"205","19352855","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/27/4d/17/cheebs.jpg","205","118","78","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheebs","Cheebs","81C8A8AE63EF8C391BF5CB36741BC286",,"186220","Bristol, United Kingdom","Bristol","Cheebs"

Check in was a breeze, staff were courteous & quick to get me assigned a room. The room had a partial view of the harbour in the distance.

They have a nice roof top pool & bar, restaurant at the lobby level and in house spa.
Good spread for breakfast & helpful doormen as well.

There's a super market opposite the hotel as well which is quite convenient.

On not just one, but two separate occasions, Samantha delivered exceptional customer service that made my experience at the property unforgettable.

The first time, he noticed I was having trouble with a last-minute change in my itinerary and took it upon himself to help coordinate everything quickly and efficiently—saving me a lot of stress. Then again, later in my stay, he went the extra mile by assisting with a special request that most would have considered outside their scope. He handled everything with a warm, professional attitude that made me feel genuinely valued as a guest.

Samantha is a standout example of what great hospitality looks like.

But what sets it apart from the excellent location and its comforts, is the premium service provided by all the staff members. From the Manager to room service, bell boys, and runners, they have re-defined hospitality to a premium standard. I had some special circumstances during my stay, and they were incredibly hospitable, kind, and tended to all of my needs with care.

The location of the property once you are there is fantastic from the rooms you can see literally just your mother nature and nothing else 
The room itself was fantastic as well because they have two stories in umbrella and hence can easily accommodate up to 6 guess very very easily. We were a family of three travelling and hence we had an amazing time. 
The food was very elated to our Taste, but and any modifications that we required were adhere to it 
They also provide classes for cooking cinnamon cutting and dirty tasting. We actually took the cinnamon cutting glass and absolutely loved it. Highly recommended for everyone. 
The staff is super courteous and ensure that guests are very well looked after 

Negatives 
Entering the place on your own can be very confusing and you also have to note that it’s about 5 to 10 minutes away from the main road for which they do provide pick and drop service all the time without any problem however to expect the road to be super bumpy

The property is stunning. The views are breathtaking, and the design is so sleek and modern. Honestly, I wish I could hire whoever styled this property to redo my home. Every little detail has been so thoughtfully put together. It’s luxurious but still super comfortable.

The staff? Absolutely amazing and hardworking. I couldn’t believe the roles we saw one person do. Front desk, restaurant server, housekeeping, guiding tours, I'm sure there was more. They were on it and all with such warmth and professionalism. Seriously impressive.

The food was fantastic. Beautiful presentation, was priced reasonably, and had such fresh, local flavors. You can tell the chef is passionate about what they do. My only small suggestion? With how chilly it gets in the evenings and all the amazing local tea and spices around, they could add some freshly made hot drinks to the menu. A good spiced tea or rich, decadent hot cocoa would be such a cozy bonus.

I’ll definitely be back. This place is worth every penny. I highly recommend it.

I first came her when the pictured palmtrees were planted and 1 ft high, more than 10 years ago. Since that day my collegues and I always stay in Hotel J during our 3-4 monthly business trips. Which means I already spend more than 200 nights here!

Hotel J is the budget formula of the Jetwing group, a large hotel and leisure group with many sites in Sri Lanka. When we travel we often stay in other (more expensive) Jetwing Hotels as well.

As business travellers we like the clean rooms, friendly staff, safe environment, good breakfast and the relaxed veranda. The ocean dip is a daily routine after a hard days work. 

The hotel also has a nice rooftop bar, often visited by groups of British youngsters who start their Sri Lanka journey here. 

If you look for  relaxed start or finish of your Sri Lankan holiday at very affordable rates I can highly recommend Hotel J.","Great value for money.

It is with great remorse that we note the inconvenience undergone by you.  
As conveyed to you upon our previous conversation the complaint pertaining to the quality of the cake was lodged more than  a  day  after collection as such we were not in a position to  conclusively determine how these circumstances arouse.  Temperature fluctuations can lead to discoloration and the formation of mould, which we believe to be the likely cause in this instance. 		
As conveyed to you ,  the cake had been inspected for quality and found to be in good condition prior to its release for delivery and all cakes at our outlets are stored in chillers until collection.   Instructions pertaining to storage and consumption accompany our meals and cakes for convenience of our patrons.
It is a prime and consistent endeavor on our part to conform to the highest quality standards for all our products.
 We trust you understand our position in this matter

The strawberries on top were moldy, which is completely unacceptable—especially from a brand with such a strong reputation in Sri Lanka.

This cake was a gift for someone very special, and I was honestly embarrassed when she pointed out the spoiled fruit. I placed the order 4 days in advance, trusting in their quality and standards.

After I raised a complaint, the staff member I spoke to tried to defend the brand by giving false explanations, insisting that it wasn’t their fault. She wasn’t unprofessional in her manner, but she clearly gave misleading information to protect the hotel's name—without understanding how their own online ordering system works or even acknowledging the timing of my purchase. None of what she said aligned with the facts. It felt like they were just trying to push the blame onto me rather than taking any responsibility.

So please be cautious if you're buying food from this hotel. In my experience, they do not genuinely consider the customer's side—they only defend their position, no matter what happens to you.

I do not recommend this place to anyone.","I do not recommend this place to anyone","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d316941-r1002886328-Mahaweli_Reach_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90sandeepaw","Sandeepa W","2C1F82EDC3A60F2A6550305012227675",,,,,"90sandeepaw"

Indika the resturant manager was really helpful. One of our family members has a lot of food allergies so he helped guide us with incidents that were used in all the recipes. Finally the General Manager Rodney Armstrong was very helpful and checked on us frequently. He made special arrangements for us since he knew of the food allergies.

At first sight we thought  it was just another International - style modern hotel, of the type you can find anywhere in the world, but we were mistaken! 

What sets it apart are the restaurant food (some of the best I have had anywhere in the last few years) but most importantly the staff. From the welcome at the front desk, to service in the main restaurant and the rooftop bar, everybody we dealt with was outstanding; friendly, professional, and thoughtful. A particular mention must go to Vimukthi, Manisha and Asitha for their friendliness and professional service in the restaurant, and also to the chef, whose name I don't know, and the kitchen staff, for preparing such excellent food, beautifully presented and cooked perfectly. 

Our room was lovely, on the 8th floor so offering a good view over the city, and very comfortable.

A perfect end to what has been a fantastic trip to this lovely country.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused at the rooftop resto-bar ward7.

I am very confident that this was a misunderstanding, as we welcome families all the time to the resto-bar. I am myself a father of a young child, I ensure that the resto-bar always maintains a child friendly atmosphere. 

I have taken this matter very seriously with the Food and beverage team to ensure that no family feels the way you have felt. We have spent time training and refreshing the entire team regarding maintaining the right attitude towards families with children. 

Once again please accept my sincere apologies and do not let this one-time occurrence keep you and your kids away from the beautiful resto-bar located at the roof top. 

Looking forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

We arrived late afternoon and left early morning. The room was comfy, good sized bed. There were some food marks on the carpet from previous guests. There’s a great rooftop/pool area, the city is so smoggy but incredible to see from so high up. My main ‘con’ were the staff on the top floor. We got the vibe when we arrived there for drinks that they didn’t welcome the children upstairs. Regardless, we stayed for food and drinks but nobody was really very friendly or approachable. We stayed there for quite a while having a few courses and playing board games with our children but the general tone did not shift.
The hotel is conveniently placed and we would stay again if it formed part of the trip, I’m personally not in a rush to go back to Colombo.","Short, comfy 1 night stay","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10626598-r994238622-Jetwing_Colombo_Seven-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452389859","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg","1200","2","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottelG412YS","Charlotte L","15ECE4CC0928AACEF28AEE611978AED0",,,,,"charlottelG412YS"

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for selecting Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We are delighted to hear that you found the staff to be lovely and they went way beyond on your expectations. 

With regard to the food pricing, unfortunately the previous government of Sri Lanka had imposed a tax on tax system which has made the food pricing on the higher side. However with the new government we expect this tax on tax system to be on a lower rate, which will have a direct positive impact on food pricing.

Thank you again for your feedback and looking forward to welcoming you back again to Jetwing Colombo Seven again.

We found the food rather expensive for what it actually was. It was okay, however nothing special and in my opinion, not worth the price charged. I understand there is a premium for being in the capital, however still felt it slightly on the pricey side for what you get.

Warmest greetings from all of us at Jetwing Colombo Seven. 

We thank you for your feedback and thank you for taking the time to discuss this matter over the phone with me the other day. Please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused during your recent stay.  

As discussed on the phone with you, I have instructed my Reservations team to inform the Chef to have String hoppers made for you specially every time you stay with us. We take that extra step to customize and personalize guests’ requests every time but, on this occasion, we have failed, and I have advised the team to ensure this is available every time you stay with us. We have a rotating menu every day of the week and as discussed, I am sure you will experience it next time.   

I have also mentioned to the roof top Ward7 retro-bar team, if food is ordered from the ground floor 57 restaurant to the roof top ward 7 retro-bar, to indicate how long it will take to the guest due to logistical reasons. I have also discussed with the F&B Manager looking at the design of serving dishes when food is ordered from the ground floor restaurant to the roof top retro-bar. 

Due to our sustainable practices, we do only serve Sri Lankan fruits, and I have also shared your concern and ensured that we have a minimum of 5 varieties of fruits available at the breakfast buffet. 

As we spoke, I hope this one-time incident will not keep you away, we look forward to welcoming you back to Jetwing Colombo Seven again. 

Ayubowan (May you live long)!
