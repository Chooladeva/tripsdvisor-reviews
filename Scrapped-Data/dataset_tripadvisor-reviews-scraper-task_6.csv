My wife and myself traveled on Monday the 23rd of June. The experience was great from the point of booking. Indika was nice enough to provide an upgrade to a junior suite at the point of booking itself.

Location:
This property is situated at a very convenient location bordering the main road at Hikkaduwa with a large seafront. The beach is very clean and beautiful. Since we travelled in the off season, the sea was rough and not suitable for sea bating. Buth the sea was beautiful with large waives and splashes. 

Facilities:
This hotel has a spacious living area and two restaurants. One is situated at the ground floor and the other one, a Japanese Restaurant, is situated at the roof top. The hotel has a nice little library, a spa and a gym as well. 

Rooms:
The rooms are modern and very clean. It has very good ambiance in the rooms. The bed is comfortable. The room has tea and coffee making facilities, a shaving kit, shower caps, sewing kit etc. that are very handy. Our room was upgraded to the Junior Site by the hotel without even requesting the same and that suit was large and well maintained. 

Garden:
There is a garden area with several chairs and pool decks that let people relax. The pool is a small one, but it is enough for a mid-size hotel such as the Riff. 

Food:
The food was ample and tasty. The food provided by the hotel is very tasty. The restaurant staff were the main plus point of this hotel. The four-course menu was too much for both of us as the portions were very generous. All the food that we ate was very tasty. The desserts were also very good with the home-made ice cream being the best. 

Service:
The Benisha was very attentive and the boy who served us, Reshmika, was accommodated to all our requests very much willingly and with a smile on his face. They went out of their way to serve us better. All the other people on the restaurant team, including the girl who served us dinner and the other boy on duty today were also excellent.    

Overall:
I could recommend this hotel to any person coming to enjoy a good relaxing holiday with good food and good service.","Great food Excellent Service and a Great Location Location","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1015136840-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","2","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip313660","AKALANKA P","9F6004E842FC62B8CCF23E313C69F105",,"293961","Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka","DayTrip313660"

Luxury cars are parked at the entrance and there’s a wonderful pool at the rear before you head onto the beach itself. There are nice restaurants on the ground floor and there’s terrace. You have use of the pool for a small fee. On the roof terrace, you see a spectacular view of Hikkadua beach itself. It’s wonderful at sunset and very romantic.

Staff are immaculately dressed, professional, engaging and attentive. I’ve swam in several pools in Hikkadua and this is so far the best one. Not too much chlorine and it’s colder than other pools also. The view overlooks the beach. The cascading waves that crash into the beach is fantastic. The pool area is surprisingly peaceful and idyllic.

The atmosphere is both calm and welcoming! Staff opened the car door, helped with my bags, welcomed me in the lobby with a drink and showed me to my room with a quick but informative tour.

And what a room! And what a view! And what a tub! And I could just keep going. I had a permanent grin on my face during my stay and I so regret not booking more nights! The room was amazing, it was clean, cool and well prepared for my stay, even had some classical music playing as I arrived. The balcony was large and had a great view of the pool area, palm trees and the ocean. From the tub and shower you could also take in part of the view.

The pool and pool area was very calm! Most people had chairs down on the beach so I could even swim alone in the pool. Staff was very careful to inform and ensure that no guest went into the ocean due to rough waves for our own security. Once you find a chair on the beach or by the pool they bring you towels and a refreshing water bottle.

Dinner on the rooftop was relaxed, only a few guests and food was tasty and service quick. Breakfast was also a good experience! Attentive staff, easy to order, many options and what a view!

The only complaints I have are few. Firstly I wish the bed was softer. Secondly I would have liked to have been informed that while I went for a massage a member of staff would enter my room after check-in to get it ready for the evening by pulling down the curtain and undoing/redoing the bedlinens. Thirdly the prices shown on the massage-menu are not the actual price and I was not informed during booking but only when I arrived for the massage. Seeing as I had been looking forward to it I was not likely to cancel then. The massage was nice, although I would have liked the massagebed to have a spot to rest my arms while lying on my stomach. 

All in all it was great! The Riff is by far the best hotel I have ever visited and before leaving I was already planning my next trip back!

Thank you for a wonderful stay!","Absolutely spectacular - Five stars!","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1006882311-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","21","130","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E_Ronja","Ronja","44B7C1794D346C1248D87F240A3CDE3E",,"189839","Malmö, Sweden","Malmö","E_Ronja"

The staff were incredibly friendly, and both my friend and I really enjoyed our time there. I arrived early on the first day, and thankfully, they allowed us to check in ahead of time, which was much appreciated.

The hotel is located right by the seafront, offering lovely views. However, the sea can be quite rough, so it's not really suitable for swimming.

The area around the hotel is fairly quiet, but there are a couple of great restaurants just in front of the hotel that I’d recommend: Two Brothers Palace (cash only) and Bella’s (accepts both cash and card). Both offer authentic and delicious food.
The hotel is about 30 minutes to an hour away from other popular spots like Mirissa and Galle. I’d recommend taking a taxi, which is quite affordable—around £20 for a round trip. We used a company called Less taxi throughout our trip.

The hotel also helped us book an excursion for £126, which included a visit to Ella and the Elephant Sanctuary. A hotel staff member picked us up at 4 AM in a comfortable Mercedes van equipped with Wi-Fi and chargers. He stayed with us throughout the day and ensured everything went smoothly. They even provided a generous breakfast box for the trip. All in all, a really memorable and well-organized experience.

When we checked out the hotel they kindly gifted us some Sri Lankan tea – would highly recommend this hotel.","Fantastic stay","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r1001724654-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","36","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamb2015","clamb2015","474ABD6F8720EF97D728DA48C5BBC27B",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","clamb2015"

Firstly, we would like to thank you for this amazing review and recommendation! It was a pleasure to have you and your family stay with us at Riff Hikkaduwa. We’re so glad you enjoyed the stunning views, the warm hospitality of our team, and the overall experience.

It’s wonderful to hear that you appreciated our breakfast selection and had the chance to try something different each day. Dining by the pool and enjoying dinner at our rooftop Japanese restaurant sounds like a fantastic way to make the most of your stay and we’re delighted that you enjoyed it.

The infinity pool and beachfront setting truly offer a relaxing escape, and while the waves can be strong at times, it’s great that you were able to enjoy the views and even try surfing nearby. Seeing a turtle nest right in front of our hotel must have been an unforgettable experience!

It was a great stay! All the staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. Hotel is really beautiful and the views from the rooms are stunning. 
Food was great, really diverse choice for breakfast. Not a buffet stile but I loved it even more. I tried different things every day, and everything was yummy. We had lunch by the pool every day. Also had dinner at Japanese restaurant on the top floor twice and it was delicious. 

Best thing was a beautiful infinity pool, chairs on the beach ( you can always find a spot ) and a gorgeous white sand beach. Waves in front of the hotel were too big for swimming in the sea but I could have watched them whole day :) you can swim just few minutes walk down the beach. And it is a great place for surfing so we tried that also. There are lots of restaurants on the beach also great food. And great beach for morning run/walk. We even had a turtle come one night and laid eggs in front of the hotel.

Отель отличный. Очень удачное местоположение - немного на отдалении от самого цента городка Хиккадува, но это большой плюс - нет шума и суеты улицы. Тишина и атмосфера, способствующая отдыху и расслаблению. Поездка на тук-туке до центра занимает 3 минуты (цена около 300 рупий - это примерно 100 рублей). Можно и пешком пройтись - это  примерно 10 - 15 минут)
Сам отель очень уютный. Отличный видовой бассейн. Свои лежаки на пляже.
Отдельно хочу сказать про персонал! Это отзывчивые и добрые люди! Все! Готовы придти на помощь в решении абсолютно любого вопроса. 
Про ресторан в отеле - у нас были только завтраки. Очень вкусно! Огромный выбор блюд. Заказ по меню. Меню на завтраке очень разнообразное! Все блюда прекрасного качества и, что немало важно, эстетичная европейская подача! Прекрасно работают официанты! Ни минуты лишнего ожидания! 
Несколько раз ужинали в ресторане отеля. Это действительно вкусно! По сравнению с ужинами в городских кафешках - просто супер! Еще раз хочу отметить качество блюд и чистоту!! Огромное спасибо менеджеру ресторана Benisha. Очень улыбчивая, внимательная и отзывчивая девушка! 
Я бы ОЧЕНЬ рекомендовала этот тихий спокойный респектабельный отель парам, семьям с детьми и взрослым людям! Молодежи, желающей острых впечатлений, шума и суеты - лучше, наверное, остановиться ближе к центру))) А тем, кто отдыхает в этом отеле всегда есть возможность попасть в эпицентр веселья, а потом вернуться в свой тихий уютный и комфортный номер без шума и суеты.","Прекрасный бутик-отель с европейским сервисом!","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r996493673-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_N9867SK","Катерина Б","A6C085B276FC0B138A8182D0CB33F4D2",,,,,"_N9867SK"

The camp is nested far in the jungle, so it’s super remote and far away from everything. Our accommodations were amazing, like it was straight out of a safari camping magazine. The staff had been fantastic, extremely attentive. 

We did only one day here, which was the perfect amount of time. We had time for one half day of safari, which we saw a lot of water buffalo, crocodiles, deer, and even a bear sloth! The park is known for the leopards, but unfortunately we did not come across any. I guess there’s always a next time!

I’d say this place is PERFECT for couples. At night, they set you up a candle lit dinner under the stars. Very romantic. Since it was our honeymoon, they even treated us to champagne at dinner.

Achi our driver and guide was a magician, he seemed to know where the animals were going to appear before any other jeep! We saw two leopards and mother & child sloth bears over the 3 safaris which are quite rare to see (also many elephants, buffalo, deer, birds & crocs). Achi went out of his way to ensure we were happy, comfortable and spotting as much wildlife as possible.

On site, the tents were luxurious and comfortable with Aircon & the restaurant is a cosy inside-outside experience where you may see chipmunks, lizards and giant squirrels whilst dining. However the highlight is the balcony area which has the most incredible panoramic views of the surrounding national park. 

The food was divine and we were served plenty of it! We had a mix of Sri Lankan and Western food - the Sri Lankan lunch platter on the first day was the best food we had on our trip courtesy of Chef Promos!

The place is magical - completely immersed in the jungle, with trees as far as the eye can see and the mountains in the distance. Something out of a story book. The main reception area is perched high up with a sprawling terrace overlooking the jungle, which makes it a great place to watch the sunrise and to witness far away lightning in the night. The sounds of the jungle are ever present reminding you at all times that you’re a part of this vibrant and lush ecosystem. Our « tent » (it’s not really a tent, definitely more like a luxury cabin) was in front of a lily pad pond and the sounds of the frogs made it a super relaxing place to sleep - no need for a sound machine there! When we arrived we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff and served a Sri Lankan meal with vegetable curries and jumbo prawns which was delicious. We then went on our first safari half day with Achi in block 5 where we spotted elephants, a leopard and plenty of monkeys, deers and various birds. The game drive is also a fascinating observation of how the drivers exchange information and try their best to get you in position for a sighting - from a monkey call to the behaviour of the deer, they’re able to analyse and read nature to hope for the glimpse of a leopard - but to be fair we were just happy being there, seeing the nature and smelling the jungle. That’s the biggest joy of being out there. The next day, we went to a full day drive on block 1 with Niro, and we loved how he spent time showing us various birds - from eagles to egret, kingfishers and bee-eaters - he had a keen eye to spot and we were fascinated with all that we discovered in the jungle. We even saw another leopard walking peacefully down the road, a family of elephants bathing, a malabar pied horn bill, painted storks, mongooses, monitor lizards, deer, grey langurs, and even Sri Lankan’s national animal the giant squirrel. 
On our last day, we went on a bush walk with Chamara, and walked through the rain forest and climbed a small (manageable) mountain to get incredible views. He also took some great pictures of us :) overall Ravi (the manager) and his team gave us an unforgettable experience and were lovely, attentive and kind throughout our stay with great attention to detail across everything - from the cleanliness of the room to the way they set the tables, to the myriad of oil lamps that are placed every night to illuminate the place. Definitely one to remember and return to.","Luxuriate in the jungle in every sense of the way","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r1004790123-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"50","355132533","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/2a/e4/75/imatine.jpg","50","2","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imatine","Indiana M","CD1AE53ED61715B574CB3EC2F9C3CE66",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","Imatine"

With his experience, he also shows you a lot of other animals that most likely you would not have seen. The Safari ride will be long, be patient as their experienced drivers look out for animals for you to see.
The rooms are nice and have air-conditioning. Understand that you’re in the middle of nature, so there will be some bugs. We did not get a squirrel in our tent because we kept our food and suitcases locked up. There was no Wi-Fi in the room, but we had our own SIM card so it was fine. And you’re really here to disconnect from everything and just enjoy nature.
The staff are all genuine and they all have great smiles.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your kind words following your recent wedding celebrations at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa.

It was truly our honour and pleasure to be part of such a special and meaningful occasion. We are delighted to hear that both you and your guests had a memorable experience with us, from the cultural and religious festivities to the decor, service, and overall ambiance.

I’m especially grateful for your appreciation of our coordination efforts. Ensuring that every detail ran smoothly and that your expectations were met was a top priority for us, and I’m glad to know that our presence and support made a difference throughout the events.

We’re thrilled to hear that the decor exceeded expectations, the drinks were flowing, and most importantly, that the food was a highlight for everyone. I will personally pass along your compliments to our Executive Chef and his culinary team; they will be delighted to know that their hard work has been recognised and appreciated.

Thank you once again for placing your trust in us during such a significant milestone. It means a great deal to the entire team. On behalf of all of us here at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa, we wish you and Shantal a lifetime of love, joy, and beautiful memories, and we hope to welcome you back again, perhaps to celebrate many anniversaries to come!

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay with us at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa. We truly regret to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations.

Please allow us to clarify regarding the charge for the bed linen. Our housekeeping and supervisory team thoroughly inspected the room upon your departure, and it was evident that the bed sheet had significant stains caused by food gravy. We would like to reassure you that it is not our practice to charge guests for minor marks or light stains, as we understand occasional wear and tear is part of normal hotel use.

However, in this case, the gravy stains were deep and permanent, despite our laundry team’s best efforts to restore the linen. As a result, the linen was deemed unfit for reuse. In such instances, we are left with no option but to apply a minimal charge to cover the damage, which was clearly communicated at checkout.

We sincerely regret if this caused disappointment and assure you that the decision was made only after careful review.

Regarding the concern about room ventilation, we will review your room allocation and share the feedback with our team to ensure all comfort standards are met consistently.

We value all our guests and appreciate your feedback as it helps us continue to improve. Should you choose to return to Colombo, we would be grateful for the opportunity to welcome you again and provide you with a more seamless and enjoyable experience.

Best Regards 
The Colombo Court Hotel & Spa Family

From beautifully proportioned rooms to open air spaces, the hotel stands a s aven of tranquility minutes away from the busting heart of the city. What used to be 3 houses alongside Colombo main road was metamorphosed into a boutique hotel. Though multi storey constructions have since sprouted out of the ground by the Galle green, the Colombo Court standa as a witness of the intricate balance of Colombo spirit ,: between offshore influences, lush nature and climate and bustling energy of the Sri Lankan people, it reflects urban tropical modernism in a applied acception.
Once checked-in  never to be forgotten. Mishfa and Mohammed at the reception are more family than hosts. Always keen to keep in touch and assist with additional support.","In Colombo cultural epicenter","2025-05","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r1011834290-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","39","163","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HED249","E DH","956B6C40C20B068665004A47E9C2A9C9",,"294009","Doha, Qatar","Doha","HED249"

My wife and I recently celebrated our 8th wedding anniversary in Sri Lanka, starting our trip in Colombo, but the true highlight was our decision to stay at Skyloft Kandy by Aaradhya. It was truly the best decision my wife made for this trip!

From the very first call, I was incredibly impressed. The hotel reception staff, especially Avindu, was so attentive, understanding, and genuinely warm in clarifying all my queries and demands – it immediately convinced me to book. Their welcome and warmth touched my heart even before arrival. Avindu even helped us click some beautiful pictures!

While the drive up the tiny mountain roads at night was a bit scary, waking up at Skyloft Kandy is like entering absolute heaven. You are immediately surrounded by lush green mountains and cozy gardens. Our room balcony offered stunning views of the sky changing colors above the mountains, with little birds adding to the serene ambiance. The peace and tranquility are exactly what a nature lover seeks. I highly recommend staying in Room R109 for an unparalleled experience.

The entire team at Skyloft Kandy is exceptional. The General Manager is truly hands-on, always on the move, ensuring every little detail is perfect. All the staff are incredibly nice and respectful of privacy; we often felt like we had the entire hotel to ourselves, aside from a few guests during breakfast. Their genuine warmth and willingness to cater to any requests, even outside the usual hotel services, truly sets them apart. This level of personalized care and attention is what truly makes a stay memorable, even if the rooms themselves might seem a little 'dull' to some – the people and their hospitality shine brightest.

The hotel's facilities are also fantastic. The pool and rooftop bar offer absolute peace with breathtaking views. Breakfast options are very good and reasonable for the price. The restaurant food options are also reasonably priced.

We had two fantastic day trips: a full day to Nuwara Eliya (""Little England"") and an exploration of Kandy. Our guide, Mr. Christy, was exceptional. He is super loyal, knowledgeable, and made us feel entirely comfortable and confident throughout our journeys. He understood our need for privacy, maintaining a respectful distance while ensuring we got the best outcome from our excursions. We had an unforgettable, private bath at Ramboda Waterfall, surrounded by beautiful nature. He truly helped us experience all the worthwhile tourist attractions.

If you are looking for an eco-friendly, nature lover's paradise with complete silence, uninterrupted mountain views, and genuine, warm hospitality, then choose to stay at Skyloft Kandy. The ambiance is amazing, the atmosphere is great, and the people truly make this place shine.","Absolute Heaven in the Mountains of Kandy- A Must-Stay!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d11998682-r1008628844-Skyloft_Kandy_By_Aaradhya-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,,,,,"0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sham777999","shamr!$@L","3270547335A9CEFEFCA725990DF6AA79",,"298571","Male","Male","sham777999"

Our room was spacious, clean, and had a stunning view of the ocean. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked perfectly, which was much appreciated in the tropical heat.

The highlight of our stay was definitely the friendly and attentive staff. Everyone – from the reception to the restaurant team – went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Special thanks to the chef for the delicious Sri Lankan meals, especially the fresh seafood!

The pool area was clean and well-maintained, and we loved enjoying drinks while watching the sunset.

The staff went above and beyond to create a memorable experience for us from room decorations to the anniversary celebration dinner which was arranged by the pool just for us.  The hotel has a really talented staff including chefs who prepared mouthwatering spreads for all our meals. 

Again, the food here is delicious and the hotel staff is fantastic. I wouldn’t do justice if I didn’t mention few names who made our stay much better. Dhammika (Restaurant Mgr), Mahinda (Restaurant Supervisor), Madushan, and Kavinda (Restaurant staff). 

I must say the rooms are so clean and tidy. It seems they pay extra attention to details. And it’s absolutely same with the hotel premises. The pictures here will tell more about what I described. 

I highly recommend this hotel to a couple or a solo trip. It’s very safe and there’s a huge pool for you to have a dip.

It’s the rest of the hotel that lets it down. The corridors are dark and smell musty, the rooms tired and in serious need of updating. Of the three windows in my room, only one could be opened without an effort, there was no fridge in the room, the TV didn’t work (no biggie for me as I was too busy to want to watch, but this shouldn’t happen) . The hot water bottles delivered to the room every evening were a nice touch but necessary as the rooms had no heating or cooling and Nuwara Eliya gets quite cold at night. Despite this, only once thin bedcover was provided, necessitating the donning of extra clothes once the hot water bottles cooled down. The staff were very accommodating and if people complained, issues were fixed. For example, a fridge was delivered to a room when asked for, however, in a 5* hotel this amenities should be standard. While I enjoyed my stay at St Andrew’s, I certainly wouldn’t rate it as 5 star.","A disappointing experience.","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579216-r1013534717-Jetwing_St_Andrew_s-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"330","96921444","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/c6/e7/64/emel49.jpg","480","85","18247","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emel49","emel49","260D1C27E79002EED7C6B541276048F4",,,,,"emel49"

We stayed here on two separate occasions and both times it was good. Rooms are comfortable, staff are helpful. There’s a filtered water fountain with reusable glass bottles you can take to your room. The hotel organised a car and driver for us; both the car and the driver were very good, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka. There’s not many good eating options nearby, but we did find a good little restaurant across the road which did excellent dosas. The only downside is the location, which is a bit away from the main attractions, although it’s easy to get a tuk tuk to wherever you want to go. If you choose to use the hotel's recommenced driver, you will pay more than one that you wave down, but he is very pleasant, reliable and drives comparatively carefully.","Comfortable, but nothing special about the surrounding area","2024-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d1541208-r956604593-Sevana_City_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","37","74","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytraveller5360","happytraveller5360","8391DD146E1F8F785E45B8C3F084AA74",,,,,"happytraveller5360"

Thank you for taking time to share a review regarding your recent stay with us. I am pleased to learn that you enjoyed our hospitality and food.

Please accept my sincere apology regarding the noise. As correctly noted by you, the noise was one-off and only during the festival days but I share your frustration and we are currently exploring how we can minimise any disturbances to our guests during the festival season next year.

I am also sorry for the issue with the pool lights. I am currently following up with our maintenance team and will rectify it as soon as possible.

A family run hotel, centrally located and deceptively small from the exterior – blink and you'd miss it. However, there were many floors and little restaurant and pool on the very top floor. The pool was small, but decent enough to enjoy a refreshing dip and observe the city from high up.

The food was extremely delicious, generous and well-cooked. Service was excellent – very friendly.

The beds were comfy, the shower was hot and the air conditioning worked well.

There was free wi-fi available and a water dispenser so that you could fill up your bottles.

Cons:

The pool was not lit up at night (unlike the pictures), so it was quite dark to swim in, but it the weather was so hot we did anyway.

Unfortunately, the night we stayed there was some kind of Hindu festival going at the (very) nearby temple. For hours there were prayers/talking and trumpet playing through loudspeakers onto the street. It was impossible to escape the noise, other than go elsewhere, but we were tired and my husband was not feeling very well, so we just surrendered to it. I should point out that this was a case of bad luck and I'm sure that it would not normally be like this.

It’s heartening to hear the recognition and warmth you’ve received from our team — especially from Isuru at the gym, Basil from animation, and our Indian chef and his team. We’re especially pleased the addition of the Indian chef has enhanced the variety you enjoy.

We also take note of your suggestions regarding consistency in amenities and gestures. Your observations are valuable, and we will certainly look into these areas to ensure a more uniform experience for all our guests.

To my surprise there was very less noise except at the temporary restaurant. 
Also, some of the rooms are being renovated. 
Saying that a lot of improvements to be seen. The guest relations team is checking on the needs of the guests and as a repeat guest, a lot of staff recognises you.
Not only the front of the house staff but all those who do not come in direct contact with guests are doing a wonderful job. To name a few. Isuru from the gym, Basil from the animation team and the Indian chef and his team. Bringing down a Indian. chef is has been one good thing to  increase the variety. The food is always good at Pegasus.
I know I have forgotten more names but next time, I will definitely include them. Adding photos of a few staff with their full consent. 
Pegasus needs to be more consistent on the standards.  For example, tissue boxes were available last year in the toilet but this year only on request,  the guest relations team hands in plates of chocolate and biscuits but one day, it's two pieces and another just one. Keep up the good work and improve the standards.

The property is stunning. Brand new, with clean, modern architecture and a calm energy throughout. We had a partial sea-facing room, which still offered a beautiful view — you could sit by the window for hours and just watch the ocean and city fade into each other.

The interiors were tasteful — minimal yet warm — and the in-room experience was smooth throughout. It never felt flashy or overwhelming, just simple luxury done right.

One of the biggest highlights was dining at Avartana. If you’re visiting, don’t miss it. It’s not your usual Indian fine-dine — it’s a full tasting experience with a carefully curated menu, incredible plating, and an ambience that really sets the tone. The storytelling behind each dish made the night feel like more than just dinner — it was a whole experience.

Some worth mentions are their high tea in the evening, the views and sunsets are breathtaking everyday, we satyed for 5 days, and we went there every day without missing it.

Do try their hand made nachos if you get a chance, those were delicious.

Also, there is infinity pool facing the sea, a sky lounge as well, free casino travel.

If you go to casino balies is worth visiting.

Massive thanks to Rephan Castelino, who helped us throughout the stay — from small details to last-minute help, he was just fantastic. Super professional, and made everything feel effortless.

If you’re planning a honeymoon or just want a relaxed luxury stay in Colombo — this place is absolutely worth it. Great food, peaceful rooms, kind staff, and just the right amount of quiet luxury.","Thoughtful Hospitality, Great Food & Views — Our Honeymoon at ITC","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1014152876-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","0","26","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer54458911309","Amanpreet Singh","EBA703682EB4A5638C223733DDD8E9DB",,"304551","New Delhi, India","New Delhi","Explorer54458911309"

Colombo hotels seem to be in a race to provide the most luxurious facilities and best service. The ITC, opened just over two years ago, is a recent entry. The huge reception lobby on the second level gives a sweeping view of the ocean. The rooms are spacious and appointed nicely. There are some nice details, such as the lilly inlays in places like the room paneling and elevator flooring. The electrical outlets are all universal, accepting plugs from around the world. 

The staff were exceptional from the moment I walked in. I wish I had noted more names.

Suresh at the bell station helped me from the beginning and throughout my stay. Shaiya checked me  in. I was glad to to see Erandhi providing the same fine service that she brought from when I first saw when she worked previously at another property. Ohthers of note were Farzath, Piyumika, and Lehansa, and Nilantha, Shyomi and Shihami (or were they the same? Small name badges), And a couple of unnamed trainees!

I'm sorry that I am surely overlooking someone because all were so good at their jobs.","New and Over the Top","2025-06","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1014103736-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1024","252087213","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/06/8b/ad/sadeyejoe.jpg","1024","19","440","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgattuso","Joe G","6EE16780FD3948A0081FC363FEE34DD8",,"30226","Alexandria, Virginia","Alexandria","jgattuso"

First of all, we thank you for this thoughtful and detailed review! It truly means the world to us that you had such a fantastic stay and enjoyed every aspect of your time with us.

We're delighted that you loved your double deluxe sea view room and that the little touches, like the complimentary teas and our commitment to sustainability, added to your experience. Providing a plastic-free environment is something we take great pride in, and it’s wonderful to hear that it resonated with you.

Our culinary team put great care into creating delicious, varied meals, and it’s great to know that they were able to meet all your requests. And, of course, we’re so pleased that you enjoyed the rooftop bar and our specialty Japanese restaurant, there’s nothing quite like watching the sunset with a great meal and a breathtaking view!

It’s lovely to hear that you made the most of the beach and poolside loungers, as well as the refreshing King Coconut while soaking in the coastal beauty.

The view of the ocean was amazing, and the room itself was spacious, spotlessly clean, and equipped with comfortable beds. They also provided an extra bed for my 8-year-old son at no additional charge. The minibar had a small fridge, and they offered free water in glass bottles, which were refilled in the morning and evening. There was a tea kettle with a selection of delicious teas from the Basilur brand, which was also complimentary. The friendly owner of the hotel also owns the tea company, which made it even more special.

I was particularly impressed by the hotel's plastic-free policy. Even the trash bags were made of paper, which made me feel good about my consumption choices. We opted for full-board, and the food was delicious and varied, served à la carte. I would like to give a big compliment to the chef for consistently meeting all of our special requests. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout our stay.

The hotel also features a rooftop bar, which is particularly stunning during sunset hours. The view from up there is breathtaking, making it a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Additionally, at the same location, there’s a Japanese restaurant that serves delicious sushi. We had the chance to try it, and it was a great dining experience—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. A wonderful addition to our stay!

The hotel has direct access to the beach, and the loungers by the pool and on the beach were comfortable. There were also plenty of umbrellas for shade. I especially enjoyed sitting by the pool with a natural shade refreshing King Coconut, gazing out at the sea. Trees provided shade, and the cool breeze made it a pleasant place to relax during the hot midday hours.

The beach was clean, and compared to the rest of the southern coastline, the water was also quite clear. However, I believe this may change depending on the season. The sea directly in front of the hotel wasn't ideal for swimming due to strong currents, but we had fun jumping in the waves. About 2 km south, there’s a place called Dodanduwa Beach where you can safely enter the water, even with children. It's a great spot for beginner surfers to try standing on the board for the first time.

If you're into snorkeling, you should definitely check out Hikkaduwa Beach, about 2 km north of the hotel. You can easily get there with a tuk-tuk for only 500 LKR. The water is crystal clear, and plenty of colorful fish can be admired. The only downside was the occasional boat traffic and the smell of kerosene, which could be a bit bothersome. The beach does offer natural shade, but since it’s public, there didn’t seem to be any regulations on the boats.

The only thing that could have made this stay even more perfect would have been a makeup mirror with light in the bathroom, which would have been the cherry on top of an unforgettable and truly relaxing vacation with my family.","Excellent stay at a charming hotel with stunning views and exceptional food","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r994425231-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ala-Ola","Ala-Ola","22D758910CF5E15B1CD5D51EFCD70464",,"187323","Berlin, Germany","Berlin","Ala-Ola"

Во-первых, мы хотели бы поблагодарить вас за этот фантастический отзыв и рекомендацию. Мы так рады слышать, что ваше пребывание у нас стало изюминкой вашей поездки на Шри-Ланку. Ваши добрые слова о роскошном пребывании и прекрасно оформленных интерьерах так много значат для нас. Осознание тог��, что вы нашли каждый уголок комнаты таким великолепным и вдохновляющим, действительно делает наши усилия стоящими. Замечательно слышать, как вам понравились высокие потолки, натуральные материалы и просторная терраса с видом на океан, такое безмятежное уединение!

Мы так рады, что пейзажный бассейн стал особой частью вашего опыта. Наблюдение за закатом из бассейна звучит как волшебный момент, и здорово знать, что это было так захватывающе, несмотря на погоду во время вашего визита.

Ваши комплименты по поводу завтрака вызывают у нас широкую улыбку. Мы рады, что вы нашли разнообразие и вкусы такими приятными, и что шри-ланкийский завтрак стал для вас изюминкой, особенно маринованный лук! Замечательно, что вам также понравилось вечернее меню, особенно ассорти из морепродуктов. Мы счастливы знать, что это принесло столько радости.

Мы также рады, что вам понравились коктейли и вы оценили качество, которое мы стремимся предоставить. Ваша похвала нашему сервису действительно согревает наши сердца. Мы рады сделать больше и больше, будь то улыбка, улучшение вашего шезлонга или отправка вас домой с частичкой Шри-Ланки в виде чая Basilur.

Еще раз спасибо за то, что выбрали нас для вашего пребывания. Мы с нетерпением ждем возможности снова приветствовать вас и надеемся, что в следующий раз погода будет такой же идеальной, как ваш отпуск.","1280","781282335","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/1f/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282336","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/20/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282337","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/21/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282338","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/22/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282339","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/23/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282340","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/24/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282341","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/25/caption.jpg","960","1280","781282342","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/91/6c/26/caption.jpg","960",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 870 Galle Rd, Hikkaduwa 80244 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80244",,"No. 870 Galle Rd",,"14968725","6.119749","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.11572","Riff Hikkaduwa","480","4.8","9","2","8","24","437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d14968725-Reviews-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://riffhikkaduwa.com/offers/","2025-01-15","OTHER","5","Со второго мЕньший обзор океана, чем с этажей выше, но зато можно ходить в номере и на террасе в халатике или без одежды из-за зелени :)","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Самое дорогое, но самое шикарное место в нашей поездке по Шри-Ланке. Стоимость за ночь полностью оправдывает себя! Интерьер был настолько великолепен, что захотелось запечатлеть каждый ракурс. Высоченные потолки, эко-стиль, переданный деревом, светлыми цветами и натуральными материалами, комфортная ванная комната, огромная терраса с видом на океан и удобной мини-софой... Не совру, если скажу, что захотелось заиметь именно такой загородный дом ^_^ Находиться в номере однозначно приятно.

Что касается остального, отметили четыре не менее важных преимущества:

1. Бассейн. Infinity pool стал нашей отдушиной, так как в те даты в океане (ну, или Лаккадивском море, кому как нравится) бушевали сильные волны, хоть и сам пляж изумительный. Наблюдать единственный закат в ту дождливую и облачную пору из бассейна было волшебно! По-моему, инстаграм был изобретён именно для фото из этого бассейна.

2. Завтраки. Просто разнообразнейший а-ля карт, можно выбрать хоть все позиции (если осилите). Блюда на основе яиц, боулы, выпечка, свежевыжатый сок, и, гвоздь региона, ланкийский завтрак. Маринованный лук из ланкийского завтрака -- моя слабость навеки!!! Платное дневное/вечернее меню тоже достойное, особенно плато морепродуктов -- по сравнению с Москвой, мы бы отдали втрое больше за втрое меньшее удовольствие.

3. Коктейли. По цене сравнимы с большинством остальных кафе и ресторанов Шри (а мы за 2 недели успели побывать много где, и да, алкоголь дороговат в переводе на наши деньги), но, безусловно, по качеству многих задвинут. Очень вкусно.

4. Конечно же, сервис. Персонал без улыбки никуда не ходит. Всегда поинтересуются, как дела, как проходит день, принесут комплиментарную холодную!!! водичку к лежаку, свежее полотенце. При отъезде подарили чай Basilur -- ну чем не солнышки?! 

Хочется ли вернуться? Безумно!!! Осталось попросить у Шри-Ланки отличной погоды в следующий раз :)","Определение слова ШИК","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r989386608-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","3","18","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_F461VN","Ирина","A7D2B6AC3EDFF2585A52B08817F6CAEB",,,,,"_F461VN"

Firstly we would like to thank you for this wonderful review and recommendation. We’re absolutely delighted to hear that we're your favourite hotel in the country and to hear that you enjoyed every aspect of your stay with us.

Our beachside location and modern design are some of the features we’re most proud of, and it’s fantastic to know that you appreciated the spacious rooms, infinity pool, and the stylish ambience of our rooftop bar. The live music is something we carefully curate to enhance the atmosphere, and we’re thrilled that it added to your enjoyment.

Your kind words about our team mean so much to us; we strive to deliver friendly and professional service, and it’s wonderful to hear that our efforts made a positive impact on your stay.

We’re especially glad that you loved our food offerings. The seafood platter and Japanese menu are indeed guest favourites, and it’s incredibly rewarding to know that you consider our sushi the best in Sri Lanka—and even abroad!

Thank you for recommending us so highly, both as a luxury stay and as a must-visit dining spot in Hikkaduwa. It was a pleasure to have you with us, and we hope to welcome you back soon for another unforgettable experience!","2048","780620408","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/78/caption.jpg","1720","2048","780620409","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/79/caption.jpg","1536","2048","780620410","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7a/caption.jpg","1536","2048","780620411","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7b/caption.jpg","1536","2048","780620412","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7c/caption.jpg","1536","1536","780620413","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7d/caption.jpg","2048","2048","780620414","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7e/caption.jpg","1726","2048","780620415","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/87/52/7f/caption.jpg","1536",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 870 Galle Rd, Hikkaduwa 80244 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80244",,"No. 870 Galle Rd",,"14968725","6.119749","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.11572","Riff Hikkaduwa","480","4.8","9","2","8","24","437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d14968725-Reviews-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://riffhikkaduwa.com/offers/","2025-01-09","MOBILE","5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My favourite hotel in the country. The beachside location is excellent and the design of the hotel is very modern and stylish. Beautiful and spacious rooms overlook an infinity pool facing the beach, with all the commodities one would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff are very friendly and professional, readily accommodating even the smallest requests with efficiency. The rooftop bar is also a great place to relax with comfortable seating for large groups and great views of Hikkaduwa beach from above. The live music is always spot on, with different musicians performing in the evenings from Wednesday to Sunday, perfectly complementing the chilled atmosphere of the venue.

A special mention must be made to the food. Every item on the menu tastes amazing and the selection for all three meals has a lot of variety. The seafood platter is my personal favourite but the Japanese menu is second to none, especially the crispy crab maki rolls. Easily the best sushi in Sri Lanka, outclassing most places offering a similar selection abroad. 

Highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious and satisfying stay. Even if you are not staying here, the restaurant is well worth a visit for anyone who is passing by hikkaduwa.","Luxury boutique hotel with beachside access and amazing food","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d14968725-r988369166-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","1","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharithJ953","Charith J","A717D21E78190440F1556D622E62D949",,,,,"CharithJ953"

The rooms are incredibly clean with everything you need and beautiful views over the beach.

Very nice touches. 
The food in the True Blue rooftop bar is lovely, and again, very attentive service. 

The only very small thing that could be a great addition to feel like complete luxury, is to provide a more efficient beverage service at the beachside sun loungers, rather than having to go into the main hotel to order drinks during the day. Saying that, the beachside attendant was super helpful in bringing a bottle of cold water in the mornings, which was fully appreciated. 

The hotel is also in a great location, very relaxed part of the beach yet only a 5-10 minute walk to the bars and restaurants of Hikkaduwa.

Во-первых, мы благодарим вас за то, что вы нашли время поделиться таким искренним и подробным отзывом о вашем пребывании у нас. Невероятно приятно слышать, что, несмотря на неидеальную погоду, ваш опыт в Riff Hikkaduwa сделал ваш отпуск особенным. Знание того, что вы считаете нас лучшим отелем в Хиккадуве и, возможно, на всем побережье, действительно много значит для нас.

Мы так счастливы и благодарны, что вы решили провести один из самых важных моментов в жизни, например, годовщину свадьбы, с нами. Маленькие сюрпризы, такие как торт и шампанское, — это наш способ сделать особые моменты еще более значимыми, и здорово знать, что они принесли вам радость. Также здорово знать, что вы оценили заботу и внимание нашей команды, а также качество нашего ресторана.

Чайная комната и ваше общение с владельцем очень близки нам по духу. Мы так рады, что его жест, когда он делился чаем, сделал ваше пребывание еще более особенным.

Мы искренне ценим ваши комплименты по поводу нашей уборки, обслуживания и бесплатного ужина в ваш последний день. Мы всегда стремимся создать теплую и гостеприимную атмосферу, в которой каждый гость чувствует заботу.

Ваши комплименты заботе и отзывчивости нашей команды много значат для нас. Спасибо, что так тепло нас рекомендовали. Для нас было честью принимать вас, и мы с нетерпением ждем возможности снова приветствовать вас для следующего пребывания — надеемся, что в следующий раз будет много солнца!","4284","776498783","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/6e/5f/caption.jpg","5712","4032","776498784","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/6e/60/caption.jpg","3024","5712","776498785","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/6e/61/caption.jpg","4284","5712","776498786","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/6e/62/caption.jpg","4284","5712","776498787","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/48/6e/63/caption.jpg","4284",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 870 Galle Rd, Hikkaduwa 80244 Sri Lanka","Hikkaduwa","Sri Lanka","80244",,"No. 870 Galle Rd",,"14968725","6.119749","Hikkaduwa, Galle District, Southern Province","80.11572","Riff Hikkaduwa","480","4.8","9","2","8","24","437","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304134-d14968725-Reviews-Riff_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","https://riffhikkaduwa.com/offers/","2024-12-06","OTHER","5",,"Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Очень редко оставляю отзыв, но этот отель не могу оставить без внимания. Отдыхали с 21.11.24 по 01.12.24. С погодой очень не повезло((( Из всех дней, было солнечных около 2-3, остальные дни практически каждый день был дождь и пасмурно. Но отель скрасил всё наше впечатление об отдыхе своим сервисом, качеством и отношением к туристам. Пообщавшись с туристами из других отелей, сделали вывод, что это самый лучший отель в Хиккадуве, а возможно и вообще на всём побережье. Мы много где отдыхали и нам есть с чем сравнить, но этот отель выше всех похвал! Персонал очень улыбчивый, всегда старается угодить и всё делает для комфортного отдыха туристов. Познакомились с владельцем отеля - МЕГА позитивный и добрый человек, хорошо говорит по-русски. У него свои чайные плантации и при отеле есть магазин этого чая. При разговоре с ним, сказали что наша мама очень любит крепкий чёрный чай, так он нам подарил целых 2 пачки разного чая. Это безумно приятно🙏
У нас была годовщина свадьбы, которую мы решили отметить в японском ресторане на последнем этаже. Нам подарили бутылку шампанского и маленький тортик со свечкой и поздравлением. Это очень было неожиданно и приятно!

По поводу кухни это вообще отдельная тема! Ресторанная подача блюд и безумно всё вкусно. У нас были включены только завтраки, т.к. хотели попробовать местную кухню и покушать в разных заведениях. Лучше и вкуснее еды (чем в нашем отеле) мы не нашли. Мы пробовали кушать в разных кафе и ресторанах на побережье и поняли, что ресторан при отеле самый лучший. Многие туристы из других отелей приходили кушать именно в наш отель.

Уборка в номере каждый день. Всё чисто, полотенце меняли каждый день и всегда следили, чтобы в номере была вода. Единственное, что мне не хватало - это каких-нибудь лебедей или слоников из полотенца😃 Но это всё мелочи, на которые точно не стоит обращать внимания)

В качестве комплимента в последний день нашего отдыха, отель нам подарил бесплатный ужин. Такого отношения, мы не встречали не в одном отеле! 

Хочу сказать огромное спасибо персоналу отеля за обслуживание и отзывчивость, шеф повору ресторана за такие изысканные и вкусные блюда и отдельное спасибо управляющему за такое приятное и доброе отношение к туристам. 
Всем рекомендую этот отель!

По приезду нас встретили и предложили воду, кофе (очень было кстати после 2 перелетов). Номер был с красивым видом - на океан (вроде, тут все номера с видом на океан). Эстетика и вкус во всем, до мелочей. На кровати лежало приветственно письмо от руководителя отеля (очень приятно). Номера убирают хорошо и каждый день приносят воду в стекле и свежие полотенца. 

На территории отеля есть два ресторана. Внизу у бассейна.  Видом на океан и на крыше (тут делают кальяны). Кухня вкусная, меню разнообразное, подача красивая. Слышала, что тут готовят самые вкусные суши в районе. Суши действительно вкуснейшие. Иногда играет живая музыка. 

Персонал просто невероятно воспитанный, все доброжелательные и желают сделать твой отдых лучше и еще лучше. 

Мы жили в номере 205 с 4 по 14 октября. В последний вечер нам предложили бесплатный ужин в ресторане отеля.

We have to give a huge shout out to the hotel driver who picked us up and dropped us off at Colombo Airport - as well as taking us out for a day to Yala National Park where we had the good fortune to not only see elephants and mugger crocodiles but also a leopard.

Breakfast was excellent and both restaurants have good food and varied menus.  This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and the hotel was well placed to not only relax but to also see some of the country, the Old Fort in Galle being another great visit.

Some quibbles: 
1. The Deluxe Room during my first stint had two odd cement blocks right in the middle of the room blocking view of the TV from almost all angles. 
2. Some work needs to be done on the Menu. The choice of soups is limited and unimaginative. For a coastal hotel, fish options are slender. Further, one had expected the Menu to have a set Sri Lankan meal, vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
3. The Spa is closed on Wednesdays, the only day I had for a look-in.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We deeply regret that your recent visit did not meet the high standards of service and hospitality that you have come to expect from us. As a valued repeat guest, your satisfaction is of utmost importance to us, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused during your stay.

Following an internal investigation, we have identified that one of our front office staff members provided incorrect information regarding the happy hour discount at our restaurant. We understand how frustrating and disappointing this must have been, and we take full responsibility for this oversight. While this mistake should not have occurred, we strongly believe that the situation could have been handled better, especially by offering the discount as a goodwill gesture to acknowledge your continued patronage with us. We deeply regret that this did not happen at the time.

Additionally, we are very sorry to hear that you found the service at reception to be below the level of warmth and professionalism that you had previously enjoyed. We will be addressing this with our team immediately to ensure that all staff members are well-informed, proactive, and always ready to assist our guests with accuracy and care.

Regarding the hot water issue, we understand how essential this is for guest comfort. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and have since addressed the matter with our maintenance team to ensure that this does not happen again.

We truly appreciate your loyalty and are saddened that this experience has left you feeling disappointed. We would love the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and restore your confidence in our service. Should you reconsider visiting us again, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly so that we can personally ensure a seamless and memorable stay.

Once again, our sincere apologies, and we thank you for your valuable feedback.

Warm regards,

Kevin Schumacher

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your recent experience with us. While we are truly pleased to hear that you enjoyed our well-appointed rooms, high standard of food, and service, we are genuinely sorry to learn that your overall stay was impacted by external noise disturbances.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the discomfort you experienced due to the road noise. We fully understand how important a restful night's sleep is, particularly when traveling for business, and it is most regrettable that we did not meet your expectations in this regard.

We greatly appreciate your constructive feedback regarding the glazing and insulation. Kindly rest assured that your comments have been shared with our management and maintenance teams as we are actively exploring solutions to minimize external noise, including future upgrades to our windows and soundproofing.

Your experience is incredibly important to us, and we value your insights as they help us identify areas for improvement. We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a much more comfortable and restful stay in the future.

Thank you once again for your feedback and your kind words regarding our team and facilities.

This hotel is glorious - old world charm with its colonial past still echoing through the rooms, in a good way.  We loved our two nights here.

Our room was very spacious and super clean, with a lovely balcony overlooking the back gardens.  It was quiet and so peaceful, getting out of bed in the mornings was difficult.

The staff were just wonderful - especially the lovely young man in the bar area who kept my friend very happy with a endless bowls of sweet potato chips with our drinks.

The location is fantastic - walking distance into the two, yet so peaceful.  The buffet for dinner and breakfast was fantastic with a huge variety of food on offer. Also plenty of seating with two dining rooms and an outside area if weather permits.

There are also lots of lovely lounge areas - many with fireplaces - to sit and while away some time.  And the fires are needed in the evenings as it can get quite cool.

Our biggest disappointment was having to leave after just two nights - I could have stayed for a month.","Two nights was not enough","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579216-r1009924233-Jetwing_St_Andrew_s-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"2048","712548496","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/78/a0/90/caption.jpg","2048","205","304","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelisaL256","Melisa L","43F41C56692FF3AF9FE4A935C2C1280C",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","MelisaL256"

Takes all the hassle out of booking safaris. The Accomodation is outstanding and the team are amazing. 

From the moment we arrived, we were wowed by the campsite, the cabins are amazing. The manager Ravi made us feel welcome and very quickly we’d met a giant squirrel, seen monkeys and deer just on the site. 

The food was fantastic every time. And the team made sure we always had a drink. Best of all was being greeted after a long day of safari with a ginger and coconut drink. It was exactly what we needed. 

We had two safari drivers and they were both brilliant. Lakmal and Achi were super knowledgeable and did everything they could to get us the best sightings and help us understand the landscape. Achi has an incredible camera and he’s more than happy to take pictures for you (like the leopard pic attached!).

Yala is a beautiful park with lots to offer. The main attraction is the leopard and we saw 3 in two days, but you’ll get more out of it if you’re happy to be entertained by amazing birds, deer and monkeys. 

We will never forget our stay, there’s no better way to immerse yourself in nature than these cabins with panoramic views, comfy beds, air conditioning and a sunken bath in the room.","An immersive safari experience","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r1000361451-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8812HKjoen","Joe N","FD649206297435B4B579D149CFC3214D",,,,,"V8812HKjoen"

We had the most amazing safari’s, with one afternoon spent in block 5 and a full day in block 1, both our drivers were absolutely amazing, so knowledgeable and made us feel safe and comfortable throughout. We had refreshments and snacks on board and lunch with drinks included during the full day safari. A big thank you to Achi who took us on our full day safari, he has so much knowledge of the area and is clearly well known amongst the other drivers, we were lucky enough to see Leopards and Achi got some beautiful wildlife photos for us. 
Overall a really wonderful experience, would definitely recommend the stay and safari. I have seen a couple of reviews from others who didn’t get the package they expected, all I can say is I had great communication with Mahesh before our trip, we confirmed what was included in our stay and package and we had no surprise or hidden costs, I thought the cost was very reasonable for the location, staff, food and safaris!

The accommodation isn’t your usual tent – more like canvas-walled cabins with solid floors, proper beds, and private bathrooms. Definitely glamping territory, but still feels connected to the landscape.

The camp is fully off-grid, powered by solar, with filtered water and eco-conscious touches throughout. Our guide, who also runs the place, was fantastic – hugely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the park. We saw a leopard attempt a hunt, loads of birds, and had some close encounters with elephants that we won’t forget anytime soon.

Also… the food was exceptional. The lobster at lunch on day one completely caught us off guard – fresh, full of flavour, and beautifully cooked.

Would absolutely recommend this if you’re after something a bit more personal and sustainable than the big lodge-style options.","Wild luxury with a personal touch","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r999504209-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cianf85","Cian F","B42B30FACFF5704E92E46CE73DFE1DDD",,,,,"cianf85"

 On arrival we were greeted and then invited to an amazing lunch, or a banquet even, of large shrimp, lentl daahl , local vegetables poppadoms etc it was glorious. 

Our tents were large with a comfortable big bed, a bath, shower and power.

The game drive the following day to The national park was really good too and Lape  was our guide. Very kind, knowledgeable and fun. (The only down was if there was a sighting of leopard all the jeeps turned up, making for a horrible experience) however we asked Lape to move on away and we sourced our own journey, and birds, animals and views. 

The food at YSC was outrageously  delicious and the chef Promod, wonderful and there were 2 young boys on work experience who were also really sweet and helpful.

The whole stuff made great efforts to make our stay as convenient as possible. Not only did they provide a huge variety of food, but also did they turn the dinner into a romantic atmosphere by putting up the tables with a spectacular view of the green landscapes. 
We slept in a wooden tent/cabin which felt cozy.

It was a big investment, but worth every penny: this was one of the best experiences of our lives.

Ravi is the consummate host and made us feel extremely welcome from the start. He and his team couldn’t do enough for us. Our ‘tent’ was large and comfortable; our sleep was only ever interrupted by birdsong or the gentle sound of raindrops hitting the roof.

Meals are served on a terrace with A VIEW: an uninterrupted panorama of Yala National Park. Eating dinner there by candle- and moonlight was extraordinary; we’ll remember it forever. Even without the view, the food was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Chamith, the chef, is young but already a culinary genius! We’ll never forget the incredible lunch he cooked us on our first day.

The icing on the cake was the two full days of safari we had at Yala. We had amazing sightings of so many birds and animals. While seeing five leopards was definitely a highlight, we were blown away by unexpectedly seeing an elephant family, two sloth bears, a beautiful jackal and some hilarious water buffalo. All this was made possible by our fantastic guide, Lappé (full name Lakmal). With nine years’ experience, he knew where to take us for off-the-beaten-track wildlife encounters, and his friendly network of fellow guides meant he could keep in touch with sightings around the park. He has an unparalleled knowledge of the fauna in Yala and we learnt so much from him. Ask for him in person - you won’t be disappointed!

From the moment we arrived the staff were attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable.

We saw leopards, elephants, buffalo, bears and lots of birds and other animal life. I would recommend a stay here if you would like to experience Yala.

This was, without a doubt, one of the most misleading, money-hungry establishments I have been to. If you’re considering booking this so-called “luxury” camp, I would honestly strongly encourage you look elsewhere.

Deceptive “All-Inclusive” That’s Anything But!

The first sign that we had been completely misled came at check-in when we were blindsided with the fact that the safari – the entire reason we booked this stay – was not actually included in our all inclusive booking. Despite the booking site clearly advertising “luxury camping with safari all inclusive,” the staff denied any responsibility for this and attempted to charge us an extortionate £100 per person for a HALF-DAY safari. We argued with not one but two managers for what felt like an eternity, only to be met with dismissiveness, a reluctance to do anything and an insistence that we should “read their glowing reviews.” When reading the reviews as they asked us to, we actually laughed off the few critical ones, thinking we hadn’t made a single mistake at all. After all, our booking explicitly stated all-inclusive with safari and restaurant but this was just a blatant lie. But by the time you’re standing there at check-in, bags in hand, with no other plans and limited options, you are left with little to no choice in the matter.

Instead, a Cheap, Unsafe, and Time-Wasting Safari Alternative!

After refusing to pay the extortionate add on rates for the safari which was sold as included, they begrudgingly offered to book us an external safari for half the price. We thought, “Well, at least we’ll still get to go.” Big mistake. The third-party tour was really not great - a sweet guide sure but also a beat-up, seatbelt-less jeep that bounced us around to no end. Instead of heading straight to the reserve, we were taken into town multiple times (once at 6AM) to pick up and drop off strangers, wasting precious safari time. Meanwhile, we later learned that two other guests had also been misled at check-in, but instead of being given the same option as us, they were pressured into paying the full price for the hotel safari option. They ended up on a completely different tour (albeit MUCH better than ours - we saw all the photos at breakfast - wish we didn’t) making it obvious to me that this was a calculated scheme to divide and extract as much money as possible from unsuspecting guests. We felt like second class guests after this and the hotel did everything possible to keep us separate - probably so we couldn’t discuss this with each other. Gutted really as there is usually strength in numbers.

We essentially paid £500 for two nights in a tent and no safari. It was just so very sad for what could have truly been amazing place and experience. Extortionate compared to the rest of Sri Lanka.

To top it all off, after being hit with the safari scam at check-in, they tried to distract us with a grand lunch presentation. And for a brief moment, we were able to shake off the disappointment, because right after lunch, my boyfriend proposed. It was a beautiful moment, until, within 30 seconds of saying yes, the manager marched over, card machine in hand, shoving the invoice at us without so much as a congratulations. They clearly didn’t want to give us a second to rethink or challenge the charges or change our minds on whether we wanted to stay or not. It all felt so calculated.

To think that after all of this we were still put on a worse safari than other guests (because they paid the ransom!!) was so disheartening. Why we couldn’t have gone together at a reduced price I don’t know. I felt like a blacklisted guest after this and it really affected our stay. I would honestly avoid this place at all costs. We feel so very sad and frustrated.","Avoid at All Costs – A Deceptive, Money-Grabbing Scam!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r998357139-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","1","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772lucyr","Lucy R","7066BE5BFFADEFBB8AEB8BA708968374",,,,,"772lucyr"

We had the luxury of staying at Yala Safari Camping for 2 nights and it didn’t disappoint.
From the moment we were collected from the meeting point as organised, our hosts couldn’t have done more to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. They were especially brilliant with our 2 young children, aged 7 and 4 - big shout out to Chamith who the kids adored! 
We were welcomed with a delicious Sri Lankan lunch, prepared by the chef Promod- probably the best meal we had during our whole trip to Sri Lanka! 
After a quick freshen up in our luxury glamping tent (with a massive bed and bath in the floor), we met with our driver Piumal who took us to zone 5 for an evening safari. Piumal was also our guide for day 2 in zone 1 and was exceptional. He was incredibly knowledgable, friendly and really cared that we had a great experience and that we saw as much wildlife as possible, he got excited too when we found the animals, which was lovely to see! Piumal guided us to successfully see Elephants, spotted deer, water buffalo, mongeese, wild boar, crocodiles, peacocks, monitor lizards, eagles, storks, monkeys, 2 leopards and even the elusive sloth bear which we were told was a very rare sighting. We couldn’t have asked for more! 
Each evening, we were treated to a candlelit meal served up in the tree tops with great service provided by Ravi, Chamara, Sagara and Chamith. 
On our final morning with the team at Yala we were driven by Chamith to the ancient temple, around 1 hour from the campsite. If you get the opportunity it is well worth a visit. A beautiful place which is very peaceful and one which has the opportunity to climb to the top of a very large rock and experience stunning views of the whole of Yala National Park. 
Our visit to Yala Safari Camping was the highlight of our visit to Sri Lanka and I would recommend it to anyone wanting an authentic, safari experience with a hint of luxury.

Our experience with Yala Safari Camping was far from what we expected. The trip was dominated by excessive and unsafe driving rather than actual time in nature.

We spent hours driving on main roads in an open jeep without seat belts, which felt extremely unsafe. At one point, our driver was even stopped by the police.
Inside Sector 5, two jeeps crashed into each other due to reckless driving. Instead of continuing the safari, we were left waiting with six adults and six children while the drivers debated a broken taillight for 40 minutes.
After this, we endured another hour on the highway back to camp, meaning our supposedly grand dinner was significantly delayed.
After spending so much time covered in dust, diesel fumes, and sunscreen, none of the guests had time to use the spa or even take a shower before dinner.
The park itself felt highly staged—a tourist circus rather than a true wildlife experience. The leopard appeared exactly at 6:00 PM, well-fed and surrounded by jeeps waiting in position. It felt orchestrated rather than natural.

On the second day, we were misled into choosing a bird-watching tour, which we assumed would be inside the national park. Instead, we were taken to a local lake, spending yet another hour in a jeep without seat belts each way. Yala Safari Camping saved money by skipping the national park entrance fee, which we had already paid for.

The boat tour at the lake was also disappointing—cheap plastic boats with polluting gasoline engines that left us surrounded by toxic fumes. Everyone had a headache from the exhaust while we sat still to observe birds.
When we raised these concerns, Yala Safari Camping assured us that the owner would contact us. That never happened.
To make matters worse, we discovered that the bird-watching trip actually costs $200 (already overpriced), not $450, which we had paid.

Final Verdict
This place lacks safety, professionalism, and transparency. The jeeps are not safe, and too much time is wasted driving rather than enjoying nature. Do not pay upfront—once they have your money, communication shuts down.

We will not return unless this was some massive misunderstanding. The site also appears to be under construction.

Would not recommend.","Disappointing and Unsafe Experience at Yala Safari Camping - Not beyond expectations!","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r995103621-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","1","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832christofferp","Christoffer P","42AF85C1B921FC8077646D0E6567D410",,,,,"832christofferp"

First and foremost, none of their Jeeps have seatbelts. This is completely unacceptable, especially considering the reckless driving. We were speeding at a minimum of 60-80 km/h on public roads, spending at least three hours of our “safari experience” just enduring this dangerous ride. To make matters worse, our driver was using his phone on social media while driving. The whole experience felt extremely unsafe, particularly with children in the car—one sudden stop could have had devastating consequences. It’s outrageous that they have chosen to cut costs on basic safety at the risk of their guests’ lives.  

On top of that, we feel completely misled regarding the actual safari experience. After dinner, we were offered the option of a bird safari instead of the planned morning safari in Block 1, as we were told that Block 1 would be overcrowded. We chose the bird safari under the clear impression that it was still a safari experience. At no point were we informed that this would take place outside the national park, in a residential area, an hour’s drive away. While the birds were beautiful, this was not the experience we had signed up for. The whole point of booking a glamping safari was to be in nature, not driving out of the park and into a village!  

Additionally, we were never informed of the significant price difference. We had paid $450  for a proper safari inside the park, but later discovered that the bird safari only costs $200. As a group of 12 people, this meant the company pocketed a huge sum by subtly steering us towards the cheaper alternative without being transparent about what we were actually getting.  

Despite multiple follow-ups, our complaints have been completely ignored. Do not pay in advance! Pay only after the tour, so you don’t end up paying for something you never received.  

We were thoroughly deceived and left with a disappointing and unsafe experience.  

We cannot recommend Yala Safari Camping at all!","Unsafe and misleading experience","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r995101867-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","0","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonep414","Lone P","BFA0946D5FA525F3D7F89B3E3D034F06",,,,,"lonep414"

We spoke to the manager and  tried to move but they only have a few rooms and were full, so we had no choice to stay put, however I was not happy about having to sleep in a damp room. It was shame as apart from this and one of the electric points not working, we would have been happy. The breakfast was fine and the restaurant area is full of beautiful plants

The place itself is very beautiful and relaxing.
Downside is rooms do not have a fridge, but we asked for one and it was delivered pronto.  It was also one of the best coldest fridges on our tour.
For the cold nights hot water bottles were placed in the bed which was lovely although we missed the first night one.

Location is very good, easy walk down into the township.

Food was hit and miss. Dinner not good but breakfast lovely.

The staff are very friendly and attentive.
Clive, Vivek and Umesh were specifically very helpful.

The hotel has a lovely garden all round, and an organic vegetable plot which all added a nice touch to the stay.

Pool table also available.
There is a good spread of food during all three meals.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts following your stay with us.

We’re glad to hear you enjoyed the comfort of your room, the charm of the gardens, and the warmth of our team. Your appreciation of the building’s history and the garden lunch experience means a great deal.

We understand that the colonial character may not resonate with everyone, but we aim to preserve the heritage while offering a unique experience in the hills. Your note on the absence of a pool is well taken — and yes, plans are in motion for future enhancements.

We appreciate your feedback and hope to welcome you back for a refreshed experience in the future.

A good sense of security within the resort.

The pool was huge and lounge chairs were easily available. Easy access to the beach smack in the middle of Pasikuda Beach.

Room for improvement -> perhaps add a bar & snack service closer to the beach.

The building has an old part and a new part, which means that you have to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the elevator, and the rooms did not have exterior facing windows. Rooms had interior ‘courtyard’ windows or no windows. We showed up without a reservation and were fortunate that they had a room available (I don’t recommend doing that). It was significantly more expensive than other places we had been staying ($54 USD compared to the $20-$40 USD range for our other hotels) and it was also much nicer. Of all the places we stayed in Sri Lanka, Sevana had the most comfortable beds with the best pillows and the best linens (they were basically Sri Lankan made Frette linen). I had the best night’s sleep here – quiet and comfy, which is striking since it is on a very busy and very noisy street right downtown. The room had a television (our first in Sri Lanka), electric kettle, toiletries, WiFi, and a small refrigerator. There was no safe, but the building is gated at night and felt extremely safe. I really liked the roof top pool, and it was bigger than I thought it would be (still small but I expected tiny). There is a shower next to the pool, which I am pretty sure no one uses to rinse off because there was a fair amount of sunscreen on the surface of the water – guests should do better. There is a seating area for smokers that also serves as a mosquito haven at night. I was not impressed with the food at the restaurant, fairly limited and not much flavor. I liked the chicken soup the best. However, their server Ruwani Piyumika was awesome. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and obviously a very hard worker. The hotel is lucky to have her. The hotel is an easy walking distance to the bus station, central market, lake, mall, and the temple. The central location also means that there are a lot of vagrants in the general area, but it did not feel unsafe. Everything in Kandy shuts down around 9 or 10 so you are in the hotel anyway. This hotel may not have the panoramic views that you get from the hotels on the hillsides, but you also can get around on your own without climbing those hills or taking a tuk tuk and that’s a good thing since traffic is bad in Kandy. Tip: if you want to rent a scooter, there are only five rental places, and you need a reservation. Totally worth it if you do.","Nice family-owned place","2022-03","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d1541208-r832996742-Sevana_City_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"481","672250346","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/11/b9/ea/beckysaurus.jpg","481","71","179","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckysaurus","Becky","F985B19903B4819393164CC7ACE67FE4",,"60745","Boston, Massachusetts","Boston","beckysaurus"

- Central location, easily accessible to all major sights in Kandy. 

- Staff were very helpful and friendly. Check in/out was quick and easy. 

- Room was large - we were given a free upgrade. Despite hotel being on a busy road are room was at the back so we heard no noise. 

- Good price. It’s a budget hotel.

Buffet was elegant and my parents were very happy with the food and service at the restaurant. Also, the restaurant is very beautiful.

But our bad experience start from when we go home. My parents wanted to see the hotel building from outside as the hotel structure is very impressive but the one security man came and chase out us from the entrance area like a dog! I said don't shout on us but he kept screaming on us made me and my parents embraced. I told him if you keep behaving like this I have to make a complain then he replied you can complain to anyone and he doesn't care!

This is unbelievable!!!! Is this 05 star standard?? Is this ITC standard??? I spoke to duty manager Asanka that time itself and he update me that he took an action against him but the point is, is this the way how ITC staff is trained to treat the guest? We spend money and to come to your property get scolded like this? My parents are old and this person makes them extremely feel bad. 0/10 guest experience!!!","Worst guest experience from security!!!!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1008436518-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,,,,,"0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yohanbernard","yohanbernard","50535CC4E05D833829B4D3890CA5B947",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Yohanbernard"

I don’t usually write reviews, and I certainly don’t believe in writing negative ones—but whenever I experience something genuinely good, I always make it a point to appreciate it.

Recently, I had a reservation handled by a wonderful lady named Vidu from the ITC reservation team. What started off with a small misunderstanding could have easily gone downhill. But Vidu stepped in with such grace, professionalism, and empathy that it completely turned the situation around.

She didn’t just clear the confusion—she made me feel heard and respected. The way she calmly explained things and turned what could’ve been a frustrating experience into a pleasant one was nothing short of impressive. It’s rare to come across someone who combines competence with such warmth and emotional intelligence.

People like Vidu truly deserve recognition. She’s a shining example of what hospitality should feel like. Kudos to her—and to ITC—for nurturing such talent. It’s people like her who make a lasting impression.","Professional approach","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d27649031-r1006396064-Itc_Ratnadipa_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"858","800451994","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/b5/ed/9a/caption.jpg","854","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prasannaw2025","Prasanna W","FD7FCB730C3317181090C870E3023E47",,"293961","Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka","prasannaw2025"

The conference facilities and accommodation is spacious but facilities in the public areas need to be updated as they feel aged. The staff were hospitable and competent, and there was a good selection of cuisine at mealtimes, with well prepared and tasty dishes, with attentive service.  Sahani at the reception was excellent in making guests feel welcome and made it a memorable experience.
Suggestions for improvement: Conference facilities need better illumination, with different options available for different users.
Accommodation: the refillable shower and bath products are environmentally friendly, but from a personal point of view I had no guarantee that they were fit for use as the containers were not sealed.  There was no assurance that these were not the same items used by a previous guests, just topped up.  I used my own products. Providing smaller reusable containers that can be refilled and sealed for each guest would be a better option.","An enduring venue","2025-05","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189028-d579219-r1009946077-Pegasus_Reef_Hotel-Wattala_Western_Province.html",,"1080","459939604","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/6a/1f/14/sr148kandy.jpg","1080","23","293","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR148Kandy","SR148","B0B5D81435EFF3C1BB2CBD638A55E8EB",,"304138","Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kandy","SR148Kandy"

The views from the hotel are spectacular! As the name suggests, it is situated waaaaaay up the mountain & you have a view right over the city & surrounding hills. Just a beautiful view and magical sunset. The drinks & meals for a tad on the pricey side, but to be honest, we found Sri Lanka quite expensive in general. The rooms were a good size, beds comfortable & the balcony very welcoming to sit & look out over the mountains. We were only here for 1 night & it was quite pleasant.

From the excitement of the first jeep ride where we were picked up from the main road by Puma for our (bumpy!) ride down to the camp, where we were met by staff who took our bags & showed us to our huge, air conditioned tent. The curry that we had for lunch on the first day was incredible and the staff are all so lovely - attentive without being intrusive. The lounge area is a calm, beautiful area that is nice to hang out in and watch the squirrels playing and the trees swaying in the breeze. We did an evening safari on the first night, guided by Puma where we were lucky enough to spot all kinds of different animals. Back to the camp for dinner, which was cooked over a huge flame right in front of us. We did a full day Safari the next day with Achi as our guide who was brilliant, very knowledgeable about the animals and the best places to spot them. 
A special mention to all of the staff who made our stay so enjoyable - Ravi, Achi, Puma, Promod, Chamith, Chamara, Sagara & Madawa.

Yala Safari Camping was fully booked when we called so he was going to arrange for us to take advantage of the facilities, food, drinks and safaris, but stay somewhere else. As luck would have it when we arrived and were greeted by the wonderful Manager Ravi, by the time he escorted us into Yala Safari Camping, he had made some rearrangements and we got a room!

The whole experience and service at Yala Safari Camping is five star, nothing was too difficult and we were treated wonderfully. From the owner, to Ravi the Manager, our fabulous waiter Aveen, the cheffing team of Promod & Chamith, to our safari driver Sharan, we had an incredible experience. The food was the best that I have eaten in Sri Lanka and Aveen arranged for us to talk with the chef and learn about the ingredients.

We were taken care of by Aveen who was incredibly attentive and helped to make our stay memorable.

We did a full day safari and our guide Nipun was brilliant, he did everything he could to ensure we got to see any much wildlife as possible, and we were incredibly lucky to see a bear, Leopards, and plenty of elephants, birds and crocodiles.

The accommodation is only accessible by jeep. We were met at the entrance to the park, with our luggage hauled onto the open-air vehicle, and then driven to the lobby. Getting there is a journey in itself!

Yala Safari Camping is a sprawling property, and it's easy to get lost moving between the lobby and the tent. Thankfully, staff were always on hand to look after me, walking me to my tent with a flashlight at night (it's a rocky walk!), ensuring my outside lights were off and tent was zipped up tightly to avoid unwanted visitors, and grabbing me in the morning for an early safari tour.

We made the mistake of pre-booking a half-day safari with an external company, not realising that guests of Yala Safari Camping receive a half-day safari included with their stay.

Meals are also included (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and each meal was an absolute feast! Dinner was barbecued meat, and lunch was seafood - you won't go hungry here. A packed breakfast was provided for the morning safari. 

My glamping tent came with a spa bath - the perfect way to spend a relaxing afternoon among nature. 

Every single staff member made my stay at Yala Safari Camping memorable. A special mention to Achintha, Ravi, Madava, Chamith, Sadaruvan, Suranga and the chef, Pranood, for the warm hospitality.

Keep in mind that accessibility may be limited for some of the tents (steep, rocky terrain walking to and from, plus a few stairs leading to the patio.) I certainly got a daily workout in, but it's worth it for such a wonderful stay!","The best sunset I've ever seen in my life at Yala Safari Camping","2024-02","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612381-d5817895-r990238325-Yala_Safari_Camping-Yala_National_Park.html",,"450","36016063","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/25/8f/bf/obses2ion.jpg","253","57","81","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/obses2ion","There Goes Vick","C128CE337D2236483C284BD923EBB365",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","obses2ion"

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your valuable feedback. We're delighted to know that your overnight stay was comfortable and that you appreciated the early check-in at no extra charge, as well as the convenience of a late check-out. It's wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your meal at the poolside restaurant, and we're glad the dishes were satisfying.

We sincerely apologize for your less-than-ideal dining experience at the rooftop terrace. Your comments regarding portion sizes and taste are noted, and we will review this with our culinary team to ensure better value and quality moving forward.

We’re also pleased to hear that you found our hotel and rooms well-maintained, and that the comfortable beds contributed to a good night’s sleep. However, we regret that the jacuzzis were unavailable during your stay. We understand this may have been disappointing, and we’ll work on minimizing such inconveniences in the future.

Your observations regarding staff attentiveness are appreciated. While our goal is to provide attentive service, we will ensure that it does not come across as overbearing.

Thank you again for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. It helps us improve and enhance the experiences we offer. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back for an even better stay in the future.

Warm regards,
The Colombo Court Hotel & Spa Family!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"32 Alfred House Ave, Colombo 00300 Sri Lanka","Colombo","Sri Lanka","00300",,"32 Alfred House Ave","","2467186","6.897766","Colombo, Western Province","79.85645","Colombo Court Hotel & Spa","1427","4.5","30","32","92","362","911","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293962-d2467186-Reviews-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html","http://www.colombocourthotel.com","2025-01-24","OTHER","4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wir hatten eine Übernachtung am Ende unseres Urlaubs hier.

Danach aßen wir noch etwas im Pool Restaurant was sehr lecker war und auch ausreichend und preislich noch ok ( Pizza Margarita & Biriyani). Am Abend zuvor wurden wir zum Essen nach oben auf die Dachterrasse geschickt. Die Portionen waren sehr klein und der Preis umso höher und geschmacklich war’s das leider nicht wert.

Thank you so much for sharing your delightful experience with us! We are thrilled to hear that your stay at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa was a memorable and positive conclusion to your Sri Lankan adventure.

It’s heartwarming to know that you enjoyed your upgraded room and its luxurious features, including the canopy bed, spacious bath, and wraparound balcony. Your excitement truly resonates with our efforts to create a unique and inviting atmosphere for our guests.

We're equally pleased that you appreciated the pool and rooftop bar, as well as our carefully curated menu. It’s wonderful to hear that our breakfast pastries stood out for you—it’s always our goal to bring a touch of excellence to every detail.

Vihan, Hanfal, and Mark will be delighted to know that their service left such a positive impression. Our team takes great pride in making every guest feel welcomed and valued.

Regarding the government tax and service charge, we truly understand your surprise. These charges are set by the Sri Lankan government, and while we must adhere to these regulations, we regret any inconvenience it caused. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you once again for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to share your kind words. It was a pleasure to host you, and we hope to welcome you back on your next visit to Colombo!

As it was only one night I wasn’t fussed about where the agent booked so I didn’t even google before arriving at Colombo Court. 
This place is spectacular when you know what you’re getting, imagine my delight when I’d been expecting a room with bed. 

 Vihan, Hanfal and Mark met us at reception and provided exemplary service. I received a free room upgrade and squealed with delight upon seeing the canopy bed, ginormous bath and the wrap around balcony. It was all stunning. 

The pool is gorgeous and the rooftop bar has been done to a really high spec. The whole experience felt like we’d stepped into a hidden oasis in the middle of the bustling noise of Colombo. 

The menu was also excellent. Benefit of being a city, they have figured out how to do breakfast pastries properly. This is notable because all the local breads we’d had to date, all tended to be on the sweet side (no matter if there is fish or onion within).

I did get whacked with an unexpected and sizeable government tax/service charge on some wine which was almost 25% of the total bill. This hasn’t happened anywhere else in Sri Lanka so it was a bit of a shock (10% service charge was the norm in the more built up touristy areas). But hey ho. The room and facilities are what I’ll be remembering for a long time to come.","Excellent experience, gorgeous room","2025-01","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2467186-r989751303-Colombo_Court_Hotel_Spa-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","7","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claairemcm","claairemcm","A92E7AEEA28FDAFA6547E8B9C32032BC",,,,,"claairemcm"

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel was calm and peaceful. One of the best parts of our stay was the hotel's beachfront location, providing us with stunning views and easy access to the beach.

The food was absolutely delicious. In fact, our return trip was largely motivated by the warm hospitality and fantastic cuisine. Everyone in our group enjoyed the meals, especially the biriyani, which was incredibly flavorful and generously filled with chicken pieces and cashews. We were even able to thank the chef personally for making the best biriyani we've ever had.

Special mention goes to the waitress, Benisha. She remembered us from our previous visit and was extremely helpful, always suggesting the best dishes for us to try and doing so with a big smile. She made our dining experience even more enjoyable. Additionally, since my mother is a vegetarian, Benisha provided her with a full board menu featuring a variety of vegetarian dishes, which was very thoughtful and appreciated.

Очень красивый, стильный дизайн как самого отеля, так и номеров. Моя оценка 100/10
Теперь по пунктам:
1. Номер. Мы брали стандартный и остались в полном восторге. Большой, уютный и с видом на океан. Уборка ежедневная (по 2!!! раза на дню). Также в номере есть все необходимые принадлежности (зубные щетки, мочалки, шампуни, гели, бритвенный набор)

2. Еда. Завтраки были включены в стоимость проживания и они шикарные. Очень разнообразное меню (не шведский стол, но поверьте, каждый найдет себе вкусности по душе). Рестораны на первом этаже и на крыше - наша отдельная любовь😍 вкусно абсолютно всё! Практически каждый день обедали и ужинали там, всегда все свежее и очень вкусное🤤  

3. Бассейн. Ну это наверное самое инстаграмное место отеля))) бассейн большой, чистый, нам практически всегда удавалось занять лежаки возле него. 

4. Океан-пляж. Большая береговая линия, пляж у отеля чистенький, за ним прям ухаживают. Мы были в июне, поэтому именно возле отеля поплавать не удалось, большие волны были каждый день. НО в 7 минутах езды (на тук-туке😁) от отеля есть «Черепаший пляж», и там практически всегда можно купаться, волны маленькие. Кстати там же можно посерфить, очень рекомендую!

Also the entry (lobby area) is a bit unusual. There is a kitchen and sitting area and the whole section is a little dark, basic and not a very welcoming feel. We booked a deluxe room and was hoping the rooms were better than the initial impression of the hotel. In fact it was a nice surprise of how modern and high quality the room was. There is a bit of a musty/damp smell, when first get into the room. Otherwise the room was spacious, modern furnishings and the bathroom (large) was updated and good quality. Really nice steam shower also. Pool area has hardly any seating at all. Enough for maybe 3 or 4 people. 
Staff very friendly and helpful throughout the stay.  I gave a 3 out of 5 review because of the slight musty smell in the room, the lobby area and also the fact that the restraunt so so expensive. I was shocked to see that for dinner, the kotthu was 1200LKR! ($7). This to me is not acceptable at this class/level of hotel. Max you pay for this in a local place, is 400LKR. Breakfast also is $5. Dont understand these prices, when its not a fancy hotel. Wifi was very good the whole time we were there, which was nice to have. I'd suggest booking a better room, as the deluxe seemed much nicer than some of the other rooms that I saw (which i walked past and door was open). Not a bad choice for the price, but it's not the most appealing to the eye.  ","Good Wifi and comfortable rooms. Otherwise a bit random. Pricey restaurant.

Beautiful setting up in the mountains. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Bathroom very small and cold. Arrived early afternoon shown to our room and told we could purchase something to eat up on the 3rd floor bar/restaurant. We ordered a pizza which took nearly half an hour to arrive only to find it was still frozen in the middle so refused it. Dinner that evening was a set meal with us being on the half board plan, again taken in the same restaurant. For service was slow. The order was wrong for my husband so he had to wait for a fresh dish to be cooked whilst I ate mine. The food was not at all hot (chicken and rice). On our exist of the restaurant food was being brought up from the kitchens in the guest lift uncovered, this is a very poor habit   Needless to say that I spent the majority of the night in the bathroom being very ill. Abdominal cramps and unable to even hold down sips of water. This was due to the temperature of my food. We had to delay our departure 3 hours before I could manage to walk to the car as so poorly.

Despite meticulously choosing it based on thousands of glowing reviews, we were severely disappointed upon arrival.

Key Issues:

- Misleading ""Luxury"" Claims – Far below international standards in hygiene, upkeep, and comfort. ""Outdated"" is an understatement.
- Unacceptable Hygiene – Best not to discuss; you’ll only regret it.
- Food Fiasco – Don’t be fooled by photos! Every savory dish is drenched in chili—except desserts. Even basic, neutral options (pasta, rice, eggs) were inedible for those unaccustomed to extreme spice.

Overrated & Overpriced – At best, a 2-star experience masquerading as premium.

Final Verdict: If you’re not from a culture where chili-heavy food and lax hygiene are the norm, steer clear. A textbook example of why you can’t trust local ratings blindly.","Avoid This Hotel – NOT for Western/European Travelers!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189028-d579219-r1003146411-Pegasus_Reef_Hotel-Wattala_Western_Province.html",,"518","397091543","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/ab/22/d7/evgen1a.jpg","518","21","154","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0l1v1aH","OliviaH","921770037985225609013F7B92EE7639",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","0l1v1aH"

Don't expect a beach you can swim in, it's more scenic than practical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Pegasus Reef for a night, mainly for its location not too far from Colombo and the airport. The hotel has a calm, open feel with a spacious garden and a nice pool area by the sea, which was a lovely spot to unwind after a long journey.

Rooms were clean and spacious, though a bit outdated in design. The bed was comfortable, but the AC was a little loud. The staff were helpful, especially at check-in, and they even managed to accommodate a last-minute request with no fuss. Room service was quick and portions were generous.

However, the food could be better. The buffet didn’t quite match the standard you'd expect for the price, and some dishes lacked flavor. Also, the beach is not really swimmable, more for views than beach lounging.

If you're just looking for a comfortable place to relax near the airport or Colombo, it's a decent pick. But if you're expecting a resort-style beachfront experience or top-tier dining, you might want to explore other options.","A Decent Stay Near Colombo - Good for a Night or Two","2024-07","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189028-d579219-r1002132963-Pegasus_Reef_Hotel-Wattala_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","40","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8773JBmohammeda","Aaqib","56D016A75A20BAFE44DFC1E5ABD4E26E",,"304138","Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kandy","D8773JBmohammeda"

We ate at The Fishery' seafood restaurant and suffered food poisoning afterwords. In addition there was a wedding set up on the grounds. I love weddings but the music was sooooo loud the windows were even vibrating. This went on for hours until I requested the manager to my room to see what I was experiencing. He agreed it wasn't acceptable but couldn't do anything about it. I would find peace only at 11pm when the wedding  finished. This was truly unacceptable & there was no compensation offered.

From the point we checked-in, the staff was so friendly and helpful and attentive to guest’s needs. We stayed for 3 nights at the suite and the suite was spacious and comfy. The resort has direct access to private beach and it was the starting of the Pasikuda season so there was no rain and the sea was so quite and calm. The blue sea and the brown beach were like a beautiful painting and the views all around are breathtaking. I suggest visiting during the season though it is bit expensive as then you can have a sunny weather and the best climate to explore the stunning beach and water sports.  
The property has some water sport activities and you can book them as you wish, we did snorkeling and it was amazing, we saw lots of fish and corals too. Talking about the property it claims the longest swimming pool in Pasikuda which is 108m and its beautiful. You can have a swim up and down the pool for a real workout or the gym too is great for that. They have indoor sports like table tennis, pool and board games like chess and carrom. 
I suggest going for the suite if you wish to have a relaxing stay as the suit is spacious with a separate living area, 2 TVs, a bathroom and another washroom, bathtub and a large balcony. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the minibar filled and it’s good if we had that too. 
The restaurant staff were so attentive to guest’s needs and I should specifically mention Kavindu, Amaya, Udara, Anjana, Mahinda (team lead), Imesh (restaurant captain) for their great service. Not forgetting others too. The platters were mouthwatering and the portions sizes are great. We were offered a new dessert the chef has prepared and that was tasty too. Thank you for the tasty platters, the chef and the team. The room service staff is also helpful and kudos to Mr. Ruwan (general manager) and the whole Sunrise Pasikuda team for your amazing hospitality. 
Wish to come again soon!","A nice relaxing stay in Pasikuda","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d28040522-r1000025061-Sunrise_Pasikuda-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",,"1024","110582756","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/97/5b/e4/thilini-ishara.jpg","1024","12","484","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thilini_ishara","Thilini Wijayaratne","C7209D01AA8352412EAB5E195F334628",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Thilini_ishara"

At the Indian Ocean Pavilion, Chef Kingsley Weerasinghe’s cuisine is truly delectable with great flavours. Kingsley epitomises the ITC hospitality we have seen in India and brings that delightful experience to Sri Lanka with the warmth of Sri Lankan service! Kanchana is an excellent Restaurant Manager and efficiently got us the table we wanted despite the restaurant being virtually full, then looked after us so well during our meal.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We’re glad to hear that you were warmly welcomed by our team and that you enjoyed the breakfast selection, including the coffee and local dishes.

We’re truly sorry to hear that certain aspects of your stay did not meet your expectations. We would like to clarify that some amenities, such as hair dryers and fridges, are available upon request—as we had explained upon your arrival. We were happy to provide these upon request and regret any inconvenience caused in the process.

Weekends, especially Saturday nights, are a busy time for us with day outings and special dinner events, which can occasionally affect the atmosphere around the property. We understand this may have disrupted your rest, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

Your comments about the room conditions have been shared with our maintenance and housekeeping teams for improvement. We're always working to enhance our guest experience, and your feedback plays an important role in that process.

Breakfast was included in the room rate and it was good; eggs, curries, rice and noodles, fruit, pastries and very good filtered coffee. Sadly our room was awful; badly maintained, dingy, no safe, no fan, no hairdryer. I understand the Sri Lankan custom of sheet only (no quilt or blanket) but this meant our options were aircon and freeze or no aircon and swelter. We opted for aircon so we had air movement and we slept in our clothes. Initially we had no fridge although one was brought on request. Perhaps there is only one that is moved around the hotel? I asked for a replacement bath towel and was given a hand towel. We hoped for a quiet rest on Saturday afternoon but music blared directly outside our room.

The artistic sculptures and paintings placed there bring an artistic ambience. Its staff, especially Dilmi Nilupa, provided the highest level of hospitality to its guests and served delicious drinks and food to its guests with the highest satisfaction.

Villa stay

1012966745

We spent 4 nights at Anantara Kalutara Resort in a villa with a private pool and had an absolutely amazing time! Throughout our stay we were welcomed and taken care of!  At the main entrance four lovely ladies performed a traditional dance, which made for such a warm and memorable first impression.

Our villa had a fresh fruit basket waiting for us, filled with the most delicious tropical fruits, the mini bar was stocked with refreshments and we had a tea and coffee station. The resort itself is stunning, with the river on one side and the beach with its wild waves on the other, such a unique and beautiful setting.

The resort offers a lot of activities , but we especially loved the sundown yoga and a wonderfully relaxing couples massage. The weather was pleasant the entire stay, with just a brief tropical shower that cleared up quickly and only added to the experience.

The attention to detail and the service were truly outstanding. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly, welcoming, and incredibly helpful. A special thank you to Ishara Disanayaka, Assistant Guest Relations Manager, and Lashan Liyanage, Front Office Manager. Both Ishara and Lashan, in particular, went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying every moment.

Even on the day of our early departure, the team kindly packed us a breakfast to go, such a thoughtful touch!

Our only regret? That we couldn’t stay longer. Sri Lanka we loved visiting your beautiful country.","Villa stay","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1012985260-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391546","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg","1200","0","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolejS5509PX","NJA55","B4113A7D492908C5E90BF21E811A5F1C",,"294009","Doha, Qatar","Doha","nicolejS5509PX"

The hotel is beautiful and peaceful. Our room was big, clean, and very comfortable. We loved the view from the balcony. The whole place feels calm and relaxing.

The food was very tasty. There were many choices, and everything was fresh and nicely made. We especially enjoyed the Sri Lankan dishes.

We also enjoyed the swimming pool, beach, and the spa. It’s the perfect place to relax and enjoy nature.

If you are looking for a quiet and luxury place to stay in Sri Lanka, we highly recommend this resort. It is good for couples, families, or even solo travelers.

It was a beautiful experience. We were surrounded by misty rolling hills and tea plantations. The property is incredible, with  10 well maintained rooms that were immaculately clean. The spacious rooms were perfect for our wedding party to get ready in. The villas interior and exterior architecture was perfect for photography. 

The W15 team has done a great job preserving the heritage of the property while offering all the modern comforts for their guests. A huge shoutout to the incredible hospitality team consisting of Sheriff, Manjula, Prabod, Hasthasava, and Keerith. They went above and beyond for us. Their warmth and hospitality left a lasting impression on us and our families.

Also a special mention to the chef at w15. Every meal was exceptional, from warm, fresh pastries in the morning to multiple course meals. The food was definitely a highlight.

Finally, a heartfelt thank you to Sidath and the management team for their coordination with our event planners and the Hilton food and beverage team to bring our vision to life. 

We are grateful to the entire W15 team for helping us organise this wedding.","Wedding weekend at W15","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r1015091804-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadhas2025","Nadha S","92452CF89FB26D65733B179564BFD93A",,,,,"nadhas2025"

I had to downgrade this beautiful hotel because of design defects and sloppy management.   The walkways from the guest rooms to the dining room and the front desk areas can be too steep for the elderly or someone suffering from asthma,       Kandy can get cold at night, but there is no provision for heating the room, despite an HVAC unit showing a  ""Heat"" setting and a ""Dry"" setting that were non-functional (as I found out later)!   Consequently, your towels remain damp (ugh) and the shower floor never dries, unless you turn on the AC during the cold weather and wear a winter jacket in the room!    We were only given 2 bath towels (no hand towels or washcloths), but requests for such items fell on deaf ears.   Complaints to management only resulted in apologies, but additional towels were never delivered!  The same was true for in-room tea and coffee supplies.  If you wanted more than one cup of your favorite beverage in your room, you are out of luck.    Breakfast was sub-par for a hotel calling itself a 'luxury' hotel - choices were limited, some dishes were too salty, and the Hopper Station was painfully slow!   I wish the guest room windows had screens so they could be left open to enjoy the cool mountain air.  Unfortunately, opening them only brought in mosquitoes, bugs, and flies.  Screen manufacturers - here is a great niche market for you!","Gorgeous location, but needs better management!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d12099424-r1011283947-Fox_Kandy_by_Fox_Resorts-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"3216","77370917","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/9c/96/25/vahndulife.jpg","4288","67","120","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vhandu_Life","Vhandu_Life","37A5EB0B2AD4D7FE10B0C8176E20B78A",,"53449","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Pittsburgh","Vhandu_Life"

There are several two story buildings that partially wind down the mountain. Each building containing three or four rooms. The views are beautiful as you look down from your balcony.

This hotel is definitely not for any person with mobility problems. The trail to your room can be taxing. The restaurant requires you to go up and down stairs.

The room only provides you with a bath towel.  We were putting the bath towel on the floor after using them because the bathroom floors got extremely slippery when wet.

Turned in my laundry early so it would be done by the end of the day. My laundry was still missing at 8:00 pm. Called reception and they said they would look into it. Called again at 8:30 pm. Finally my laundry arrived at 8:45 ,pm.

While the room was exceptionally clean, the towel supply was inconsistent.  We received varying numbers of towels each day, even having only one bath towel to share on our last night when the hotel was full.  Additionally, the bed sheets were stained, of poor quality, and pilled, making them uncomfortable and feeling like there were crumbs in the bed. 
I found the food temperature inconsistent, often lukewarm or cold, though this might be a matter of personal preference. (I am fussy and like hot food to be hot; my husband ate the food, ok). The staff were truly lovely and accommodating, and did their best to help me.
The hotel is situated on top of a mountain and takes about 15 minutes from bottom to top. A couple of times, we had to walk the final steep hill because our driver just couldn't get to the top, which was ok for us because we are able bodied. The views from this hotel are truly breathtaking, and the sunset (from the main gate and down the hill little way) are truly amazing.

The view from the rooms was breathtaking and the food was excellent. I had read many positive reviews about the staff and was not disappointed! Everyone, from the front office (Jude and Senuki) to the restaurant chefs and waiters, and ground staff were so accommodating! We really appreciated the level of care shown to my father (who is 92 years old and has trouble walking). I even wondered where staff had been trained as it’s uncommon to receive such excellent service in other places. My parents also enjoyed playing the piano at the reception area and the Avurudu celebration organised for guests was much appreciated.

Великолепный дизайн , номера очень просторные и уютные с современной мебелью и качественными матрасами, виды с балкона номера потрясающие!
На территории есть 2 великолепных бассейна.

Персонал отеля – просто находка! Они лучшие!  всегда готовы помочь с любыми вопросами, горничные поддерживают идеальную чистоту, а на ресепшене говорят на нескольких языках. Особенно впечатлило, как быстро они реагируют на любые просьбы.

Ресторан, расположенный в отеле, поражает своей изысканностью с первого взгляда. Уютный интерьер  создаёт идеальную атмосферу для  ужина . А веранда - просто идеальное место для вечернего отдыха в отеле.

Шеф-повар творит настоящие кулинарные чудеса! Особенно впечатляют блюда из морепродуктов — свежайшие и очень вкусно приготовлены. Заказывали часто креветки, блюда из тунца, белой рыбы  — это было просто божественно!
Это именно тот отель, где хочется остановиться снова. Рекомендую этот отель всем, кто ценит комфорт и качественный сервис.

Я б снова вернулась) Современный, ухоженный уютный отельчик, локация красивая, народу не много, не толпятся. Завтрак разнообразный. До моря пройтись по джунглям минут 7, и что классно - оживленная улица прямо в 2-3 минутах от отеля, а сам отель в очень тихой зоне! Персонал реагирует на просьбы, помогает при необходимости. Понятно, что не все идеально, но главное в том, что на все твои простые реагируют и идут навстречу. 

В номере убирался юный парень Dilshan, спасибо ему за чистый номер и настроение! Уже знал, что и как нам больше нравится по быту, старался сразу учитывать) ну а где не замечал, по первой просьбе все в лучшем виде) Ты нам создал очень классное уютное ощущение, пока мы там отдыхали! Спасибо за твое внимание)

Ресепшн отзывчивый, на связи всегда. Отдельное огромное спасибо от всей души юной девушке с кудрявыми вол��сами, я к сожалению забыла имя!(( Может потом найду и дополню отзыв! Она и на завтраках внимательна к нам была, и с местной связью сколько мы разбирались - имей ей удалось решить проблему 🙏🏼

Это два отеля объединенных одним названием, ресторан был в waves, все жильцы могли пользоваться обеими территориями.
Кормили вкусно, брали только завтраки, еда немного специфична, не Турция, но нам было хорошо. Отель не самый близкий ко всем локациям но и не далеко, везде реально дойти пешком, изучили весь район от и до, много пользовались местными автобусами, вообще топ) нас там за местных считали уже) 
В номере просторно, все предоставляли когда в этом была необходимость, персонал душки, все приятные, постоянно улыбаются и здороваются. В отеле раз в неделю проходили представления, фаер шоу 
Тихо спокойно, с заднего двора всегда смотрели на павлинов по утрам))
Главный менеджер (лысый парень:) очень приятный, с ним было легко поддерживать общение, все мальчики ребята, девочки на ресепшене приветливые и дружелюбные.
Много интернациональных туристов ну и россиян)
Проблем никаких не было, все было хорошо, отдых удался!
Спасибо за отдых, нам очень понравилось, сейчас вспоминаю и хочется вернуться обратно 🥹😍🥰

ПС многие говорят про воровство на Шри, но в данном отеле мы об этом не слышали, все тихо спокойно, но свои хитрости на всякий случай мы тоже использовали","Шри ланка Thaproban pavilion waves","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r1007460367-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7862ZD_","Надежда М","050010B09EE739CFFD749D47E2E1EC35",,,,,"G7862ZD_"

It's in beautiful surroundings right by a nice beach,but it's so overpriced for what it offers. It's relying upon it's location.
The evening buffet is so overpriced, and the service is not great. 
No atmosphere or Sri Lankan experience feeling at all. For a genuine experience walk up the road to the Red Lobster run by a family and so authentic and reasonably priced. 
We paid quite a premium for a Deluxe Ocean View and had no sea view apart from a little bit over tall palm trees. Please don't waste your money.
When we went to settle the bill at reception it took forever. Definitely not 5* service. They definitely need to up their game. Having stayed in various hotels in Southern India which excelled,  this hotel does not live up to it's expectations.

What made this place truly wonderful was the amazing staff. From the moment we were welcomed into the hotel to the time we left for home, the staff went out of their way to smile, say hello, and generally make sure we were looked after.

A special shout out to the staff in the Olu restaurant. The food was so varied and incredibly delicious. The chefs are so passionate about the food being provided and it was great to learn more about the food from them. Service here was fantastic. What a great team!

We got to know some really great people at the Olu Bar. Suranda, Nipun, Kavithra and Thilina  were fantastic. It was a pleasure chatting with this team. We were really sad to say goodbye, but want to thank them for making our stay so memorable!

The location is stunning—nestled between a peaceful lagoon and the Indian Ocean, the resort offers breathtaking views and a sense of calm that’s hard to find elsewhere.

The staff were exceptional Specially Uneska —always attentive, smiling, and ready to assist with anything we needed. Check-in was seamless, and we were welcomed with a refreshing drink and a warm introduction to the property.

Our room was spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully designed with traditional Sri Lankan elements blended beautifully with modern comforts. We especially loved the private balcony overlooking the water and the open-concept bathroom with a luxurious bathtub.

Dining was a highlight of our stay. Each meal was a treat—from fresh seafood at Olu to the delicious international breakfast buffet. The chefs clearly take pride in their craft, and the variety offered meant there was something for every palate.

We also enjoyed the spa and yoga sessions, which added an extra layer of relaxation to our stay. The resort grounds are beautifully maintained, with lush gardens, a quiet beach, and tranquil pool areas perfect for unwinding.

Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, a family holiday, or simply a break from the hustle and bustle, Anantara Kalutara offers an unforgettable experience. We left feeling refreshed, pampered, and already planning our return.

Infinity pool was nice as was the sun deck even if sun beds were a little close together for my UK comfort.

Restaurant was small but really nice and the food was exceptional, all being home cooked. The veggie burger and fries was one of the tastiest I have ever eaten. Wish we had been there longer to try the home made ice creams. 

As with all our trip around Sri Lanka, the staff were exceptional.

Location wise, a certain level of fitness would be needed to walk to and from the hotel to the centre due to it being on top of the cliffs.

Además, ofrecen una gran variedad de platos para comer/cenar, con opciones locales e internacionales, al igual que para desayunar, que siempre viene acompañado de un zumo natural y varias piezas de fruta.
Las habitaciones son muy amplias, luminosas y muy cómodas.

It’s wonderful to know that you found the rooftop and pool relaxing and that our restaurant meals were to your liking — your compliments truly mean a lot to our team.

We do understand your point about the remoteness during nighttime strolls, and we appreciate you highlighting this. While the seclusion offers serenity and breathtaking views, we acknowledge it can feel limiting after dark without transport. Your input is valuable and will help us explore ways to improve the guest experience in this regard.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our location, rooms, and the hospitality of our staff. However, we regret that your dining experience did not meet your expectations.

We would like to clarify a few points regarding your concerns. Our children's meals were available, and as per our policy, we ensure that all our young guests are well taken care of, including providing complimentary meals. Additionally, our dessert options were fully available during your stay. If there was any confusion regarding availability, we sincerely apologize for the miscommunication.

Regarding the dinner menu, it appears there was an unintentional mix-up with the lunch menu being provided instead. We acknowledge this mistake and will work to ensure it does not happen again.

As for breakfast, our chickpea dish is a homemade alternative to baked beans, which was explained at the time. Had a request been made for baked beans, we would have been happy to accommodate it.

We reached out to you for further clarification so we could investigate the concerns and improve where needed, but unfortunately, we did not receive a response. Upon reviewing our records, apart from an item ordered at 4 PM, no additional charges were applied.

We appreciate all feedback as it helps us improve, but we also want to ensure that the information shared is accurate. We take guest satisfaction very seriously and always strive to provide the best possible experience.

Thank you again for your visit, and we hope to welcome you back in the future.

Best regards,
Harsha.

The hotel is actually two hotels; Thaprobam Pavilion and Thaprobam Waves. They are connected together with one reception area and the pools and bar can be used by both sets of guests.

We stayed one night in the Pavilion and two nights at Waves. The rooms at Waves are more modern and the mattress was much more firm so I would recommend booking a room here. That said all the staff were amazing and did everything they could to accommodate our requests and look after us.

The two pools were good and we never struggled to find sun loungers.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by warm, smiling faces at reception. A special mention to Sohani and Sandanu for their wonderful welcome – they truly set the tone for our whole stay.

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel at home. We stayed in the two-bedroom suite, which was perfect for our family of four. The split-level design made it feel especially spacious and luxurious.

The hotel has been tastefully designed with a serene beach vibe throughout. The main pool is absolutely stunning, offering views out to sea, and the smaller pool provided a peaceful alternative – also with beautiful views.

The location of the hotel was excellent. Just a 10–15 minute walk into town – or a quick tuk-tuk ride if you prefer – it was close enough to be convenient but far enough away to remain peaceful and relaxing.

Breakfast was generous and catered to all tastes, with both Western and Sri Lankan options. We also enjoyed lunch and dinner at the hotel – every meal was delicious and pleased both adults and kids alike.

During our stay, we went on several trips, and we’re especially grateful to Gihan for his fantastic advice on the best places to visit.

We were genuinely sad to leave the Thaproban and are already thinking about when we can return! The hotel itself is stunning but it is the staff that make it. We highly recommend staying.","A Truly Memorable Stay – We Can’t Wait to Return!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r1000983815-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"320","70529220","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/34/30/c4/jennifer-m.jpg","180","62","46","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferM84","Jennifer M","0ACDAE1F21787940215F902C6EF0FEEE",,"186605","Dublin, Ireland","Dublin","JenniferM84"

The Kottu is very good. Try to use the pool. See if you can get a room on the side over the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We found Fox Kandy to be the one hotel which did not quite live up to expectations as much as others. It does indeed have a very impressive view, if you have the right room and is certainly on the top of Kandy. There is a pool which we used in the evening which was a nice temperature. The hotel is difficult to get to for anyone as it's a very tight and sharp road so difficult to eat anywhere but the hotel. The hotel restaurant is good, but feels a little cold in atmosphere and noisy with the fairly common chopping of the Roti for the Kottu Roti. To be fair I actually loved the Kottu Roti which was cooked fresh, so I was ok with it. The standard buffet was good by looks but I ate from the Sri Lankan Pots to eat traditionally which was very good and did so for breakfast also. The room was ok, the bed was as most beds in Sri Lankan hotels quite a decent size and was comfortable. I mark it down because we did not feel like we belonged as we did with other hotels, but we did stay at lots of Boutique hotels. I think Fox Kandy is on the limit between Boutique and a larger hotel and I think that's what makes it feel slightly less personal. The staff did help us out when I left my phone in our drivers car, and we did appreciate that too. ","Good Stay in Kandy.

We stayed two nights on a tour around Sri Lanka and had stayed in much smaller hotels prior to the Fox Candy. Despite the impressive facilities, the overall atmosphere of the hotel feels somewhat impersonal. The service, while polite and professional, lacks the warmth and personal touch that you get from a smaller hotel.
The restaurant is a buffet and can get rather noisy with the clatter of plates.

The resort is beautifully situated, offering breathtaking valley views from most rooms, making sunrise a spectacular sight. The cleanliness and upkeep of the property were commendable, adding to the comfort of our stay.

One minor challenge was the approach road, which was difficult to navigate by bus at night. However, during the day, it wasn’t much of an issue.

The resort's pool was a highlight for our family, providing a relaxing and enjoyable time. Breakfast was impressive, especially the Sri Lankan counter, which gave us a wonderful introduction to the local cuisine. However, we felt that dinner could be improved by offering an à la carte option alongside the buffet option.

Overall, Fox Kandy Resort is a fantastic place to stay, offering a serene atmosphere, stunning views, and a well-maintained property. We had a memorable time and would recommend it to anyone visiting Kandy.

Luckily for us, we did not notice her.

Contrary to her description, we had a blissful time relaxing at W15 (occupying 2 rooms for 4 nights, I expect that's why children are welcome as well as couples who seemed to stay for only 1 or 2 nights only). We would highly recommend the hotel to couples or families. It feels like a home away from home in the most beautiful surroundings.

All the staff were delightful, and very kind to the children. Sherriff and Hastha were always ready to help and arrange wonderful activities. We also appreciated the turn down service and the lovely housekeeping staff.

The hotel has two expert naturalists, Banuka and Anju. We were really impressed by their knowledge and professionalism. They took us on a nature walk and also a hike. They were highly engaging and made the activities lots of fun and interesting for the children who otherwise could have got bored or tired in the heat.

The hotel location is perfect- very close to Kandy for visiting the city and also in the most beautiful and serene setting in the mountains, with spectacular views and immaculately kept grounds.

The design and interiors of the house are also stunning and very comfortable. We loved sitting on the wrap around veranda,  playing board games in the library and lounge, swimming in the pool and playing croquet on the lawn.","Serene, immaculate and welcoming","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r1001656189-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,,,,,"49","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMI64","SMI64","CB04D7A3DFFC5C051A029CF8A299E778",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","SMI64"

Our room and the property were beautiful, and the explanation of the excursions and dining was excellent. We were served by Sheriff, Prabod, Hastha and Navod who were wonderful. 

Just a couple of minor things I would change if possible:

- ordering food straight after a meal for the next meal is difficult, I found myself worrying I wasn’t hungry enough etc. I understand the need for this, but I couldn’t face the food I’d ordered for the time we’d requested both evenings and went to bed very full and a little uncomfortable. It would be nice to be able to choose later, or have a more casual approach to this.

- The property isn’t adult only, and in my opinion, should be. A family with 3 children were there when we were, and they were constantly shouting, screaming and running around. The property is very small and intimate, so it isn’t really possible to remove yourself, and it completely spoils the atmosphere. I was loving hearing the natural sounds and watching the view, and swimming in complete bliss. All of this was ruined once the children descended. We were having a lovely morning at the pool, but this was ruined when the family landed and the children were repeatedly jumping in and out, splashing and screaming. We therefore moved to the lawn but would have really liked the option to swim to cool down. Our room had a private part of the veranda which was wonderful and we dined there each evening; however the children kept running past really close to us somewhat spoiling it, and it didn’t feel private with them constantly staring at us. Fortunately a thunder storm came and sent them indoors. The parents seemed on edge the whole time, and I don’t know what was worse, hearing the children or the parents constantly berating them for being children. It would be easier all round if there was an age limit.

That being said, it’s a beautiful property and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Another thanks to the staff who were absolutely incredible.","Great, just a couple of minor tweaks would make it perfection in my opinion","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r1001398916-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"720","98683768","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/e1/cb/78/katie-louise-a.jpg","960","78","706","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katie-LouiseA","Katie-Louise A","38FFEA096AEA84C8AE96F545577D898B",,"8039151","Heath Charnock, United Kingdom","Heath Charnock","Katie-LouiseA"

We’re also glad you enjoyed the wildlife adventure with Banuka—spotting leopard paw prints and learning about the local landscape must have been an unforgettable experience. And of course, the little comforts like the nighttime turndown service and hot water bottles make all the difference!

Amazing location with wonderful team taking care of us.

We have just left our stay at W15. Our room, number 2, was large, spotlessly clean with a separate shower and roll top bath, we had our own lounge and French windows opening onto our private garden. 

Nothing was too much trouble for all the team and we were looked after by an amazing team of butlers, Sheriff, Hastha, Prabod and Navod. They were wonderful and we cannot praise them enough. 

To celebrate our wedding anniversary they surprised us with a delicious cake. They also arranged a special dinner with a separate table for two in the garden for us. It was a lovely experience and one we will never forget.

We went out on a wildlife ride in their open top vintage land rover defender.. Our guide was Banuka and he showed us leopard paw prints and claw scratches on trees. He was very informative about the landscape, wildlife and local tea picking. 

Nighttime turn down service included a hot water bottle if you need it. 

We highly recommend the hotel. It is in a peaceful location with a wonderful view and fabulous team.

В этом году выбрали отель Thaproban Pavilion Waves  и не ошиблись. Для Унаватуны это очень достойный уровень. 

Месторасположение: Отель красивый, расположен в живописном месте. Утопает в зелени с одной стороны и имеет прекрасный вид на океан, к сожалению не купабельный.  До пляжа 5-7 минут пешком по прямой дороге и минут 15 в обход ( попадаешь почти в центр пляжа). Зато в этот раз мы отлично изучили эту часть Унаватуны.  В пешей доступности Джангл Бич, вокруг очень много неплохих кафе.

Номер: Весь номерной фонд расположен с видом на океан, у каждого номера на 2 этаже есть балкончики ,в категории номеров Queen king size (такой был у нас) окно с балкона небольшое. Номер просторный, хорошая кровать, диванчик, телевизор, чайник и чайные принадлежности, кофе, заварка, сахар, исправно работающий кондиционер, сейф, холодильник. В ванной фен, ванные принадлежности, полотенца, шапочки для душа, мыло для рук, крем, гель для душа, шампунь, кондиционер для волос. Все с местными ароматами поэтому мы использовали свои средства. Каждый день приносили по 0,5 чистой воды на человека. Переходники для розеток нам не понадобились, все подходило. 
Уборка была каждый день, полотенца чистые в номере меняли каждый день, бельё постельное несколько раз, возможно через день. Номер в принципе был достаточно чистый, хотя все пишут что отель нуждается в косметическом ремонте. 

Завтраки: Достойные завтраки.  В сравнении с тем же Тайландом возможно скромнее,  но за 10 дней нам ничего не надоело. Дома питаемся однозначно не в таком разнообразии. Омлет, яичница, соки, выпечка в разнообразии, овощи, фрукты, сыры, сосиски, бекон, каши, местная еда, блинчики, чай, кофе. За отдельную плату можно заказать кофе из кофемашины, вполне кстати сносный. Все вкусно. Персонал внимательный. 

Развлечения: за 10 дней нашего прибывания отель устраивал 3 мероприятия, с танцами, с музыкой. Один раз выступал Life Band, в другой день был DJ. В эти дни действовала система фуршета на ужин. Мероприятия длились максимум до 11 вечера. Неплохой вариант для тех кто привязан к деткам и так далее. 

Персонал: Персонал отзывчивый, приветливый, дружелюбный, заботливый. Все просьбы выполнялись охотно. Менеджер гостиницы всегда интересуется все ли нам нравится. Каждый день с улыбкой нам выдавались пляжные полотенца. В принципе все делали для того чтоб наш отдых был отличным. 

Окружение: местоположение отеля ещё прекрасно и тем что находится слегка отдалено от шумных улочек и прогуливаясь от пляжа до отеля можно встретить павлинов, варанов, дружелюбных собак, обезьян, пальмовых белок. 

Хотим поблагодарить всю команду отеля за теплый приём. Желаем вам процветания.","Наша вторая и не последняя поездка на Шри-Ланку","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d13223642-r997215613-Thaproban_Pavilion_Waves-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q4740HF","Анастасия У","785105EE521BF04B84B286FC12F6D7E2",,,,,"_Q4740HF"

This is not sabotage by a competitor or the review of some disgruntled ex-employee, please look at my many many other reviews of five star hotels around the world. I have also been for several years a Platinum member of the GHA Discovery loyalty programme of which Anantara is part.  
 
The hotel is on a peninsula by a lagoon so not really a ""beach hotel"" especially with large waves, being on the west coast.  It has the advantage of being relatively close to the airport as the expressway bypasses Colombo city.  
 
For context we stayed six nights, in a pool villa, at over US$1,000 per night for bed and breakfast, which also creates certain reasonable expectations (especially given Sri Lanka is not generally very expensive and this is not in a major city).  
 
Oh dear. Where to start.  
 
Maybe with the arrival. I could not believe the entrance to the hotel.  It could have been a municipal car park. No nice plants or flowers, just a concrete desk in the brutalist style.   And loads of parked cars with no hedge or anything to screen them.  Literally the worst first impression of any hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere in Asia.    
 
They do try, there is a delightful dance by some girls in local costume with drummers to escort you from the car park entrance to the actual reception, which is a nice touch. 
 
Hotels, in general, and including the Anantara, are not very good at appreciating that after a sixteen hour journey door-to-door, guests just want to get to their rooms, not wait around in very hot un-air-conditioned reception areas. You have all my details, the room is paid for, what takes so long?
 
Wine-gate
The next catastrophe was the religious holiday.  We had arrived two days before the local New Year's celebration.  Mea culpa.  I refer again to the 16 hour journey - we were looking forward to relaxing with a drink. However, the host who took us to the room declared that the hotel bars were now shut due to the holiday, and no alcohol was available for THREE DAYS.  Not, I'm afraid, our idea of a holiday. And half of our entire stay at this hotel. Why had they not e-mailed to warn us of this?  The same guy re-confirmed that by Whatsapp that afternoon, none of the restaurants or bars were serving alcohol.  But we could have alcohol delivered and drink it in the room.  So rather than an atmospheric dinner on our first night we had room service.   
 
So to have a drink the next day by our private pool we ordered beers on room service.  To save phoning again and waiting, answering the door again, we ordered four, and put two in the fridge.  Seemingly all good.  Until later when wanting to consume said beers, we discover there is no bottle opener in the suite. So, phone up again.  And wait.  After 20 minutes, phone again.  Two minutes later a bottle opener arrives.   Three minutes later another knock on the door, and a second bottle opener arrives!   
 
Then I realise that the wine we have ordered in advance for the evening (on the basis there is none in the restaurants) has a cork.  And there is no corkscrew in the room.  Sorry, the thousand-bucks-a-night suite. What they have delivered (twice) will only open beer/soda bottles.  So rather than waiting to call until after dinner I phone, again, and ask for a corkscrew, so I will be prepared.  A few minutes later same room service guy, says he has come to open the wine.  I don't want the wine opened now, I want the advanced technology to enable me to open it later that evening after returning from our (dry) dinner.   
 
Poor guy, he says it is his own personal corkscrew, but hands it over to me anyway, bless him.  I told him to go straight back and make the hotel give him a replacement.  I really hope they did. 
 
Went for dinner.  And guess what, they are serving wine, no problem. The embargo on alcohol was only for one night not three. 
 
The Anantara boasts three restaurants.  The main restaurant is an international buffet (you know the type).  It's alright, if that is what you are looking for in a five star experience. And an Italian (more later!). We chose to go to ""Spice Traders"", the Asian option.  The food was actually very good, with table service 'n all. An overall nice experience, more or less what we would expect. So far, so good. 
 
On two of the subsequent evenings we tried to book we were told Spice Traders was closed.  This left the five star hotel with a choice of only two restaurants: a buffet, or an Italian. And we had not really flown ten hours to eat Italian. Unacceptable and absolutely not as promoted.
 
I was really hoping to call out the Italian restaurant, Acquolino as a highlight.  We had lunch there, fresh pizza, which was excellent.  For dinner, I had a seafood risotto which was very very good indeed (fine dining standard). The wife had a good lamb shank, falling off the bone. All lovely.  
 
Sadly the wheels fell off with our final lunch.  I guess we chose badly, but the menu is limited and it was our fourth lunch there.  A terrible lasagne that could have been straight from a (down-market) supermarket and a tagliatelle dish with horrible tomato sauce, bland and far too sweet, seemingly out of a jar.  Such a shame. 
 
Bottled water:  there is definitely a problem with the bottled water supplier, or the Anantara is storing it for too long before use.  Increasingly through the stay, the water provided was off. And yes, water can go off!! It started as the occasional bottle, but by day six seemed to be every bottle we opened smelt of old socks.  We did not encounter this at any of the other four hotels at which we stayed in Sri Lanka.
 
We have stayed in several hotels around the world in rooms with private pools.  And never before have only two outdoor towels been provided. The whole point is you want to use the pool in the morning, before housekeeping comes, with a fresh towel.  You then use that one all day.  So provide four towels.  It does not increase the overall towel consumption at all. You simply start the day with a fresh towel. Pool suite etiquette 101. 
 
Checkout: the reception area is not air-conditioned so is naturally very hot and humid. The only ceiling fans are over on the other side of this area and nowhere near the desks.  The process is slow, and made infuriating by the fact that those behind the desk have standalone desk fans on full blast.  Pointing at the staff (who are accustomed to the heat) rather than the paying guests!!
 
There is then a leaving ceremony to wish you well on your journey, which is another nice touch.  
 
All the staff were very polite and friendly and keen for us to be happy. And there was certainly no shortage of staff. But providing a five star experience is all about attention to detail. So many silly things that could be fixed. Like the telephone for room service that sounds like they are underwater and so impossible to understand. It is just unnecessary frustration. Like the coffee cups in the room not being paired with the correct matching saucers so they slide around and spill.  Small but so simple.  
 
Occupancy was clearly low while we were there, which is a cause for concern. And it seems tourism across the island has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. But despite local economic challenges there is a global brand to preserve.  Perhaps merging the Anantara Kalutara into the adjacent Avani (already common ownership) and targeting a lower price point with lower expectations, is a solution worth considering.  
 
Perhaps we were just unlucky. But sadly we will not be using any Anantara again.","Seriously disappointing for an Anantara, multiple problems","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1006091499-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",,"450","36611581","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2e/a5/fd/hugh-d.jpg","480","119","149","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughTPD","HughTPD","F099E003B0DBDC56D56AA5D89EF4D4EC",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","HughTPD"

Очень чуткие к желаниям гостей , хорошее настроение посетителей у них искренне в приоритете . Первый раз летели в Шри Ланку, немного опасались что не подойдет кухня так как не любим белый рис, карри и традиционную Азиатскую кухню . Но в этом прекрасном отеле была европейская кухня и так же азиатская, мы в итоге прониклись и азиатской тоже . Все было очень вкусно . Пару раз за ужином подходил шеф позвал и спраши��ал что мы хотим , сказал что приготовлю что пожелаете . 
Я сама дизайнер Интерьера и могу сказать что номер в котором мы жили с очень красивым дизайном и качественным ремонтом . В номере каждый день качественно убирались , много комплиментов вроде большой фруктовой корзины , или милого набора конфеток .
 Погода так же была супер хотя нам говорили что в апреле будут дожди ,но за 2 недели дождь днем был только пару раз , быстро закончился . В общем в восторге от шри ланка, от отеля . Однозначно его всем смело рекомендуем . 
Спасибо этим работникам отеля : Сампат, Иша, Таринду","Спасибо за наш прекрасный отпуск !","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1005610928-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adar696","Ada R","B37148C4B460DC45E682C7F37C22199D",,,,,"adar696"

Thank you for sharing your recent experience with Anantara Kalutara Resort.  It’s wonderful to hear that you appreciated the natural beauty of our setting, the attentive service from our team. That said, we’re very sorry to learn that certain aspects of your visit did not meet your expectations.  While our aim is to create comfortable and relaxing environments throughout the resort, we understand that Sri Lanka’s climate can be challenging, and your suggestions about enhancing cooling options in the bar and restaurant areas are greatly appreciated. We are actively reviewing this to explore better solutions. 

We also regret the inconvenience caused by the room’s location and the lack of orientation upon arrival.  Regarding your ocean view room upgrade, we’re truly sorry that it did not meet your expectations in terms of value or distinction. We continually strive to enhance our standards, and your feedback provides us with important insight into areas that need more attention.

We genuinely hope you left with some fond memories, despite the areas of disappointment, and we would welcome the opportunity to host you again with an experience that truly reflects the excellence we aim to deliver.

The service throughout is fantastic and having room service and drinking sundowners on the balcony to the sound of the ocean was very special.
Food at breakfast very nice with a wide variety and the best cheese we had on our whole tour .
The room servicing by Saman was very thorough.
The room and shower were both lovely and aircon and fan provided a lovely cool haven. 
However there are issues :

The room is the only place to cool down in the whole complex, even the pools are warm . The climate in SL is brutal at times and the bar ( with only one portable air conditioner) and the restaurant ( with none ) are just too hot .

Our room was a very long way away from bar/reception , it took us our whole stay to find the easiest route , we were never shown on arrival.

The cooling system in room needs tweaking. When on balcony at night if doors are open ( which they need to be to cool balcony) the room floor turns into a lethal skating rink .

On night one we had the buffet at a cost of £25 each ( and that is with allegedly 40% off ) , it was ordinary at best , and the restaurant is too warm .
There are 2 other eateries up the road , Red Lobster and Coconut Bay far superior and much cheaper 

Finally we paid over £300 for a room upgrade to a “ deluxe ocean view room “ …. the room was the same as others in our group and the ocean view was at a distance and partially obscured by trees .
There were no other added extras which on other upgrades we’ve had in e.g Costa Rica and Malaysia, disappointing","Mixed bag","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1004458328-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",,"769","333129464","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/13/db/26/f8/mikefre3.jpg","769","401","343","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikefre3","Michael F","8E7AB83438A3F74ECD071A470FE98337",,"186402","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Birmingham","mikefre3"

Warm greetings from Anantara Kalutara Resort!

Thank you ever so much for taking the time to share such an incredibly thoughtful and generous review following your recent stay with us. We are truly honoured to have hosted Camida's overseas Sales Meeting, and even more delighted to learn that your experience with us has been described as “perfection.”

Your kind words have been shared with our entire team. To hear that this was the first hotel buffet you genuinely enjoyed—and that our restaurants served the best food during your time in Sri Lanka—is a compliment we will always treasure.

We hope to have the privilege of welcoming you and the Camida team back in the near future—whether for another conference, or perhaps even a well-deserved getaway.

We have visited many Countries for this purpose over the last 30 years or so.
As our Company has grown we have had to move from  high quality boutique hotels to resort style hotels that can offer us a range of dining and bar experiences.
We are always concerned that compromising to a resort will mean the ambiance will be lessened.
That is definitely not the case with Anantara Kalutara.
As an example I have never ever enjoyed dinner served as a hotel buffet.
This was the first exception to that in my life. In fact the food at all the hotel restaurants was the very best food we experienced during our time in Sri Lanka.
The head chef is a star!
In fact every single member of the very numerous staff were helpful courteous and pleasant 
All the amenities were of a very high standard too - the business meeting rooms, the bars, the rooms, the swimming pools.
We had our best ever Sales conference and this was the best venue ever.
Its very rare that i find nothing to criticize in a hotel.
But this place is perfect.","Perfection for us","2025-04","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304136-d10154736-r1004086646-Anantara_Kalutara_Resort-Kalutara_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","84","47","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833DavidA","David A","7B62E07F4BFE5AA7670FC68B8FA5CDE0",,"212095","Clonmel, Ireland","Clonmel","833DavidA"

Perfectly happy with our choice to go with the Ocean View rooms as the view were fantastic. Having such spacious rooms and balconies really made the stay pleasant and you don't even need to step out as much if you really don't want to. Lots of excurssions, two nights weren't enough so we'll definitely come back and the service from the staff all round was pretty great. Any concerns or requests were addressed by all the front office staff. John from the reservations team helped with the initial experiene and even ensured to check up on us during our stay so we noticed that all teams really go the extra mile that way and they were fantastic. The Avrudu festivities has been the best I experienced so far and they were very generous with that they had to offer on that day.

The team including the General Manager Sidath was there to welcome us.

The food and the location is just perfect. And the team was always ready to go above and beyond to meet our expectations.

Few notes to improve

1. Would be nice if the e-bikes would be in working condition than being in manual mode. Some may appreciate the extra kick to ride back

2. The small ponds around the property could use some cleaning

3. For the minibar for full board guests.. Some softdrinks to be included will be nice.

My partner and I enjoyed a 4 night stay at W15 Hanthana Estate, and we already miss being there. This place really exceeded our expectations: The views are unbelievable, we spent hours just soaking it all in from different spots around the property. It’s the perfect place to come to stillness after lots of active travel.

The whole team made our stay wonderful, from the incredible food to the warmth of every interaction. We honestly wouldn’t have had the same experience without them. The butlers are amazing, anticipating our needs before we even realised them ourselves. Manjula is such a gem, bringing warmth, cheer, and genuine care in his service. Navod was also fantastic – he has a great sense of humor and made us feel right at home. A highlight of the stay was our morning hike with Naturalist Aju. His knowledge of the area’s nature but also history and culture made the hike more than a simple excursion (which in itself was gorgeous). Special mention goes to General Manager, Sidath, who went above and beyond with thoughtful touches throughout our stay. We felt like we were treated more like family than guests and hope to return with our family one day. ps.

Thank you for the absolutely heartwarming and beautifully detailed review! We are beyond thrilled to hear that your stay at W15 Hanthana was such a special and unforgettable experience for your entire family. From the misty valley views and sumptuous High Tea with Navod to the breathtaking hikes with Bhanuka and the once-in-a-lifetime wildlife encounters—including a rare leopard sighting!—it truly sounds like an adventure to cherish forever.

We love that your little explorers had so much fun hunting for treasure, spotting wildlife, and even mastering Sri Lankan cooking with Chef Rasika! And of course, unwinding with a G&T while the kids caught fireflies by the fire—what a perfect way to end the day.

Your kind words about Sidath, Navod, Bhanuka, Puvi, and the whole team mean the world to us, and we can't wait to welcome you all back for more magical moments. Thank you for sharing your experience—it truly captures the essence of W15 Hanthana!

The attention to detail, the staff who all went above and beyond and the sense of space and beauty Hanthana offered us was out of this world.  When we arrived in Hanthana (wife, myself; 11yo, 9yo & 5yo in tow) we were treated to not only a spectacularly misty view over the valley, but a sumptuous High Tea; expertly served by Navod who talked us through the variety of teas we could choose from. Obviously, being in the center of one of the most renowned tea areas in the world has its benefits! W15 were happy to suggest and organise a variety of trips for us and not only did the nearby town of Kandy have a wide selection of cultural trips to partake in (Notably the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple); but the surrounding wilderness offered stunning walks and experiences. Bhanuka, the hotel's resident naturalist took us on a wonderful hike up the mountainside, through the tea plantations. It was perfectly manageable for our 5 year old and I would highly recommend as he talked us through the flora and fauna and excited all 3 children with his stories. It was so good that our 5 year old had to be carried off the mountain as he was too busy looking for buried treasure! Another highlight was the 'Rock Bar' where Navod, our personal butler (!), Bhanuka and Puvi, took us up in the hotel's Land Rover Defender to explore some of the trails and find a local lookout where Navod expertly setup a portable bar to create cocktails and mocktails in the great outdoors. A wonderful setting for me and my wife to enjoy the peace and tranquility and a playground for the children who were busy building dens and hunting for crystals with Bhanuka.  It was like our own personal childcare in the wild!  A firm favourite with the children.   Our guides also spotted a range of wild animals including an eagle, a barking deer and a LEOPARD!  Apparently this was exceptionally rare!  Our final day saw Rasika, the Executive Chef, treat us to a cooking course of local curry dishes where the children took the reins and created a wonderful lunchtime spread. Whilst it was a wonderfully busy couple of days, it was always a pleasure returning to our rooms before the evening meal, being able to soak in the bath and then retire to the veranda for a G&T whilst the children caught fireflies and drank hot chocolates by the fires. So many other wonderful touches to these days - the idyllic pool, the visit to the Tea Museum, the gigantic treehouse swing overlooking the valley, the local tea menu and lobster for lunch.  The list is endess as these are only the highlights.  Fantastic. Many thanks to Sidath and the team, we will be back!","One of the most special and unique family experiences","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r995879308-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcL6659XP","Daniel C","3A075E18A5569C522795CCBEBD97CFCA",,,,,"danielcL6659XP"

And if you have some time, ask for Udina. One of the best massages we had. 
Last but not least, the gorgeous nature surrounding you on W15 is unforgettable.

If you want to experience what Sri Lanka is all about, I highly suggest visiting here. It's very close to one of the major tourist locations, ""Kandy Temple"" and you will really get the experience of living in a tea plantation. Take a plantation tour in their beautiful truck and you will be transported into a whole different world, filled with happiness and tranquility. The place is breathtaking and  friendliness of the staff truly is amazing. 

Manjula, Hastha, Navod and Prabad helped us through our stay and their commitment to make this place, our visit a memorable one is worth the mention.

The food for all 3 sittings is creative and the choices are excellent. The lobster was amazing.
Finally the staff is so professional,  friendly and care about your comfort and enjoyment.
As a surprise they did a special dinner on the deck with a fire and canles... magical.
There were 4 outstanding butlers ,Navod, Manjula, Hastha and Prebod. We highly recommend.","Elegant and Peaceful","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d19381109-r992606509-W15_Hanthana_Estate_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","1","23","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2337QKstevene","Steve E","19AF16F928BD9C856A6BB99FA7EE85E4",,"60878","Seattle, Washington","Seattle","G2337QKstevene"

The evening sunset was so fabulous over the lagoon after 4pm,,The hotel is having a spacious lagoon deck to enjoy your sunset or to relax with your loved ones even till mid night .
Till dark we enjoyed in the pool the by witnessing all evening dramas in the sky.
The BBQ dinner was superb with a large spread & plenty of choices.Itvwas so nice with all arrangements on the buffet & very tasty in all corners 
Following day breakfast we had at the Moya- rooftop with adding much more glamour to the  view over the lagoon.The view was stunning when look at all over the places from a seven floor rooftop.I would like to name that place as Moya Sky Lounge rather than rooftop.
So about the breakfast no words ,,same as dinner means lot of choices,had enough with local & international foods & each was very tasty.
The lunch was next level buffet with lot of action stations & sea food selection.To be honest to the first time in my life I' ve experienced the Fish egg action station in a buffet 
Thanks & hat off to Ex.Chef Mr.Jude,,chef Mr.Paul Palitha & all assistants at the kitchen for the delesious dishes during our stay.Other hand the hotel is very clean in all areas such as rooms,pool,garden,etc,,
Further the hotel has arranged a swing & floating ferry on the lagoon to add more flavour to your stay,, also two tree houses enjoy your boose with your loved ones.
This hotel is highly recommended to overseas travelers to come enjoy your stay with a different amenities & a passion.Also to transit passengers can enjoy your stay to the next level as the hotel very close to the Airport means just 5-6 km away,,
Hope the new General Manager Mr.Vish will add more wonders to the hotel(,ex Kids play area)
Finally Thank You Amagi for your great hospitality during our stay.Hope to see you again.

It didn’t feel at all like a 4 star hotel - more like a basic hotel like a travel lodge. We were only staying for one night prior to returning home so, on a positive, it was extremely convenient to the airport - just 15 minutes away - and we weren’t aware of any aeroplane noise at any time., despite the proximity to the airport. 

However, if I did it again, I would have stayed south of Colombo in a nicer hoteland had a longer drive to the airport. 

The hotel was very dated and a bit grubby. Our room was on the ground floor with patio doors out onto the main pool area. While we were there, there were 2 weddings so we had loud thumpy music in our room and, when this stopped, the neighbouring hotel, which was also right next to our room,  piped up with music and fireworks. 

There was some repairs being done to the plumbing outside our room so we were woken up early by the banging of the maintenance team, having been disturbed by the people in the room next door leaving loudly (sounded like they were in the room as the front door was not very sound-proofed) at 4.30 am. All in all we got very little sleep. 

There were no net curtains in the room so our choice was to keep the curtains drawn and have a dingy room but privacy or open the curtains and give everyone in the pool and terrace area a view right into our room. 

The air conditioning was very cold and noisy and would not switch off with the remote control. The only way we could switch it off was to pull the power through removing the key card but that also disabled the power sockets and meant we couldn’t charge our phones overnight. 

Someone had been sick on the floor amongst the pool sun loungers and this hadn’t been spotted by staff, so I had to ask someone to clean it up. 

Because of the weddings, there was only the buffet available for lunch and the rooftop restaurant was closed - looked like it hadn’t been open for some time. 

The staff were nice enough, there was water in the room and WiFi and you could help yourself to beach towels. These were positives. 

In summary I would say  it was ok as somewhere to lay your head if you had an early start for the airport but I would not recommend it as a place to stay for more than that. We stayed in stunning places for the rest of our holiday and this hotel didn’t come up to the other plces’s standards and we were pleased when it was time to leave.","Convenient for the airport but dated","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d3207997-r988707901-Amagi_Aria-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","16","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Longbota","Longbota","BDC578EE1487248B77CA159B07B11E48",,,,,"Longbota"

Disliked - all 4 mattresses were catastrophically old, worn out (first time this happened in 14 days Sri Lanka staying in much more modest accommodation before)
- we had booked double beds and were 'upgraded' to better view but separate beds, we asked for additional linen for our third child (who had to sleep in the crack of the two separate beds) and staff was strangely reluctant to comply immediately explaining we could use the other 2 linens to bridge the gap (?). no mention of an extra bed (which to be fair we did not explicitly asked for).
- staff miss-punched the charged amount to pay in Rupies instead of Dollars, the transaction costs are mine
- uncomfortable infestation of the pool area with crows, pool mostly in the shade after 3pm (maybe therefore nice and cool)
- classical example of a probably once nice hotel run down by current management","once probably nice hotel run down","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d3207997-r988134564-Amagi_Aria-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391071","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1200","9","29","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3978JGchristopherb","Christopher B","873A587F6E8C4E19C9ACD40B31B672C0",,"190454","Vienna, Austria","Vienna","W3978JGchristopherb"

Die Lage oberhalb Unawatuna ermöglicht Gästen nicht nur eine fantastische Aussicht auf den Indischen Ozean, sondern auch eine schnelle Anbindung zu lokalen Stränden, Restaurants und Sehenswürdigkeiten, wie z.B. Fort Galle. Fußläufig oder mit dem hauseigenen Tuk-Tuk-Service des Hotel gelangt man an den idyllischen „Jungle-Beach“. 

Die Zimmer im **Agnus** sind modern und hochwertig eingerichtet, mit großen Fenstern und Balkonen, die den Blick auf das Meer freigeben. Zusätzlich sind kleine Annehmlichkeiten wie Wasserkocher, Kühlschrank und kostenlose Pflegeprodukte vorhanden.

Das hoteleigene Restaurant bietet ausgezeichnete lokale und internationale Küche. Die traditionellen sri-lankischen Frühstücksoptionen und die frischen Meeresfrüchte sind ein Genuss und bieten ein authentisches Geschmackserlebnis. 

Besonders hervorzuheben ist das freundliche und hilfsbereite Personal. Die Mitarbeiter sind nicht nur äußerst professionell, sondern vermitteln auch echte sri-lankische Herzlichkeit. Sie stehen jederzeit zur Verfügung und geben auch wertvolle Tipps zu Ausflügen und Aktivitäten in der Umgebung.

Auch hatten wir das große Glück, Thilanga als unseren Tuk-Tuk-Fahrer für die Erkundung der Gegend rund um Unawatuna und Fort Galle zu haben! Von Anfang an hat uns Thilangas Freundlichkeit und Herzlichkeit beeindruckt. Er hat uns nicht nur die klassischen Sehenswürdigkeiten gezeigt, sondern auch zu versteckten Orten abseits der Touristenpfade gebracht, die wir sonst nie entdeckt hätten.
Wir können Thilanga uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen! Wenn ihr eine authentische Erkundung der Umgebung sucht, ist er die perfekte Wahl. Kontakt zu Thilanga über WhatsApp: +94764295475

Unser Fazit
Für uns ist das **Agnus** ist eine exzellente Wahl für Reisende, die Entspannung, Komfort und eine persönliche Note suchen. Die Kombination aus traumhafter Aussicht, gehobener Ausstattung und gastfreundlichem Service macht den Aufenthalt unvergesslich.

We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the situation you mentioned. As part of our commitment to guest safety, we have a strict policy that outside visitors are not permitted in guest rooms without prior approval from hotel management. This rule is in place to ensure the safety, privacy, and comfort of all our guests.

In this particular instance, you, who was not a guest of the hotel, entered the room without informing hotel management, which violated our policy. Additionally, we received multiple complaints from other guests regarding this situation, which prompted us to intervene. We respectfully informed you of this and kindly asked that your visitor meet you in the lobby area or bar lounge, where all in-house guests are welcome to receive visitors within the hotel premises.

Unfortunately, your group became abusive toward our staff, and we had no choice but to take necessary action. As you can understand, we are responsible for ensuring that the property remains a safe and welcoming environment for all our guests, and such behavior cannot be tolerated.

Regarding the incident, our manager, Mr. Ranjith, personally spoke with Mr. Nicholas, the actual guest in the room. However, we want to clarify that Mr. Ranjith had no interaction with you, who posted this complaint, as you were the person who was occupying the room illegally.

Kind regards,
Ranjith,

We were sitting quietly in our room with 2 friends and they kept calling us and telling us we are not allowed to have a guest in our room. Then, some staff member came and screamed at us as though he was a gangster asking us to come out of the room. When we asked the Manager who this man was who yelling at us for no reason he says its someone from House Keeping. What a joke. Then they send their receptionist who is a woman to apologize for his behaviour towards us. They refused to make the staff member from housekeeping apologize to us. It was all extremely strange.

The service is friendly, and the hotel offers free transport to the nearby Jungle beach. However, the rooftop bar and pool provide an even more peaceful and stunning experience, especially at sunset, complemented by excellent cocktails. We booked a Deluxe Double Room with a Balcony and Sea View, which was spotlessly clean and offered a beautiful sea view for a relaxing stay. The food was delicious, set in a calm atmosphere. Don't miss out on their handmade ice creams for dessert—they're some of the best in Sri Lanka. The only aspect that could be improved is the restaurant service, to make the stay even more special. Since we had an early morning flight, the thoughtful staff packed breakfast for us. This place is highly recommended for those seeking a peaceful escape with amazing views and food!

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We appreciate your detailed insights into your experience at our boutique establishment above Jungle Beach.

We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed the lovely views and spacious rooms, as well as the convenience of our free tuk shuttle service. It's also great to know that you found our breakfast made to order satisfactory and that dinner provided enough options to choose from.

However, we apologize for any underwhelming aspects of your stay, such as the small pool and the front side of the property. Your comments regarding our staff's efficiency are duly noted, and we will strive to improve in this area to ensure a smoother experience for our guests.

Regarding the pricing, we understand your perspective and will certainly take it into consideration as we continually evaluate and adjust our offerings to provide the best possible value for our guests.

Thank you again for sharing your thoughts with us. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with an even better experience.

Firstly, they did not respond to our emails, which was quite frustrating. When I tried to book directly through their website as a Sri Lankan resident, they quoted Rs. 57,000 for a half-board stay for a couple. However, when I made the reservation through a travel agent using my non-resident husband's details, I was offered a much cheaper rate, which was quite disappointing and felt unfair.

Regarding the food, the options were very limited, and the taste did not meet our expectations. It lacked variety and flavor compared to our previous visit.

The room we were given initially looked good, but when we went to sleep, we realized that what appeared to be a king-size bed was actually two smaller beds joined together with separate mattresses. This made it quite uncomfortable and disrupted our sleep.

Another downside was the driver’s accommodation. Unlike our last visit, where it was included, we were now required to pay separately for both his food and stay, which was an unexpected inconvenience.

Overall, this visit fell short of our expectations, and unfortunately, we will not be returning to this hotel. Based on our experience, I cannot honestly recommend it to others.","Review of Fox Kandy Hotel – Disappointing Second Visit","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d12099424-r990587070-Fox_Kandy_by_Fox_Resorts-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452392144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg","1200","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shamilak2025","Shamila K","2ED26E6AC709ABC17271AB417D8B4F27",,"155019","Toronto, Canada","Toronto","shamilak2025"

We traveled by taxi, and since the hotel is perched atop a hill, the drive was somewhat demanding.

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed with a delightful cup of tea. Although the official check-in time was 2:00 pm, the hotel generously allowed a free early check-in at 12:30 pm, which was a thoughtful gesture, even though I couldn’t make it early.

The views from the hotel are truly breathtaking! Despite the overcast skies, strong breeze, and light drizzle during our stay, the surrounding hills looked spectacular and added to the serene ambiance.

The staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, making us feel at home. Our room was cozy and comfortable, though we didn’t use the pool as the weather was too cold and windy for my preference.

As our booking included only breakfast, we enjoyed a delightful meal the next morning. The spread was satisfying and well-prepared.

We faced some difficulty arranging a return taxi, but the reception staff went above and beyond to help us by organizing a tuk-tuk at a reasonable rate. Their assistance made our departure much smoother.

Виды и расположение шикарные, пешком можно дойти до 3 пляжей, бесплатно подвезут от отеля до самого любимого Jangle beach, очень близко улица с ресторанами и магазинчиками, но в то же время вы находитесь в природе🌱 Бурундучки, обезьяны, мангусты, игуаны, но можно не переживать, они не переходят ваши личные границы 😁

Отель небольшой и это очень комфортно, для вас всегда везде будет место🙌🏼
