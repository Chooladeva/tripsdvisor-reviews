On arrival we were all given a drink & a Hilton warm cookie, this was a lovely touch & the kids loved it. 
The lobby was very comfortable & welcoming and the kids especially loved sitting on the swing chairs.

Rooms - they were modern & had all the amenities needed. The beds were very comfortable too. 

Dinner/Breakfast - there was a great variety of food to choose from, we especially enjoyed the fresh Dosa’s made on request. 

Swimming Pool - we all really enjoyed using the pool after breakfast, the pool attendant gave the kids floats to use & the children loved it. It was a lovely environment to have a swim.

This was my second time at this Resort and for a property that must be 4 to 5 years old, I must say that the Hotel Buildings, both inside and outside, are beautifully maintained, as are the surrounds, almost as if every blade of grass or leaf of a tree has been placed in position with an artful eye.

After a morning start from Colombo, we were warmly welcomed upon our arrival, by GM Dayan Nawagamuwa, Executive Chef Nisanka Alawatta and the rest of the warm and friendly Double Tree Team who spared no pains to make certain that Service Standards, whether at mealtimes or otherwise, left nothing wanting. 

Our Rice & Curry Lunch was simply delicious ! Executive Chef Alawatta was in personal attendance in the Dining Area to make certain of the satisfaction of every guest and we observed his presence even during Breakfast Service times.  

We made an early afternoon start for the Yala National Park and although our Game Drive was not especially successful, we enjoyed being back at the Hotel to shower and change before enjoying a glass of Red Wine and Dinner which we opted to have served in the beautifully situated “Redshank” Dining area on the topmost floor. 

Our choice of “Lagoon Prawn” for the Main Course was proven to be the right one with presentation of the Dish itself being as artistically appealing to the eye as the most attractive colour poster of this Prawn Dish well positioned in the Ground Floor Lobby to catch one’s eye as one moved towards the Dining Area. 

Two Breakfasts later, we were amply reassured that the Kitchens of the Double Tree, served up only the best, be it in terms of variety, quality, taste, flavour and presentation, whatever the item that was on offer on the ample Buffet or A’ la Carte Menu.

We enjoyed every moment of our Stay at Double Tree and vowed to ourselves that we would soon be back !

If there was one negative or irritant that we kept encountering, that was the design of the Cutlery in use at Double Tree. We found the balance of the Cutlery to be such as to render their use both awkward and impracticable. In a property where every little detail has seemingly to have received such careful attention to detail, including the Guest Rooms and Public areas, the issue with the Cutlery stood out as a short-coming which has somehow inexplicably been missed in the overall attention to achieving 100% Customer Satisfaction.

I wish Double Tree by Hilton Weerawila and the Management of this fine Property continued success in every aspect of the Planning and Management of this high quality 5-Star Resort Property.

A huge thank you to Kulunu – he embodies what real hospitality means. In today’s world, many focus solely on service, forgetting the heart of hospitality. Kulunu reminded us of that through his genuine care, going beyond textbooks and standard procedures.

We also want to thank Sneha for arranging our Yala tour – her communication was excellent and everything was perfectly organised. A shoutout to Thilaksho as well, who assisted us during check-in and made the process smooth.

The property itself is stunning – clean, modern, and beautifully maintained. We highly recommend doing the Yala tour from here; it was well priced, and they handled everything from hotel pickup to drop-off seamlessly.

While we didn’t try the seafood restaurant, we did try both the breakfast and dinner buffets. The breakfast was good, but we found the dinner buffet disappointing – the food wasn’t very tasty and didn’t offer great value compared to other hotels. On our second night, we opted to eat upstairs casual dining  outlet  and it was so good – super tasty food at a great price! And super good cockatiels too.

The pool is absolutely mind-blowing, and the entire property offers everything you could need – it’s a place where you could easily spend an entire week without wanting to leave.

The only issue we encountered was with the coffee. As coffee lovers, we found it hard to get a good cup – which seems to be a wider issue across Sri Lanka. I had one unfortunate experience where I ordered an iced latte and received a cold brew instead. The staff member didn’t seem to know the difference, and I had to show a picture from the internet. When I explained, he simply said, “This is how we make it.”

Aside from that minor issue, our stay was exceptional, and we would definitely return. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!","Must visit","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1007697680-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sithiram2022","Sithira M","F88F77725D6A5FDA8EA6F6FF1899CDF4",,,,,"sithiram2022"

Since we had to leave early for our safari, the hotel thoughtfully prepared a packed breakfast for us, complete with water and a juice box, which was a lovely touch.

I stayed two nights and had a great experience overall. The hotel upgraded our room and was very accommodating when I requested to switch to one with a better view. While the room and amenities were comfortable, they did feel a bit dated, which was surprising given the hotel opened in 2020. That said, it didn’t detract from the quality of the stay.

The spa was wonderful with great massage options and the staff there were kind and warm.

The food at the main restaurant was enjoyable. A special highlight was the signature warm cookies served upon check-in, it was absolutely delectable!","Great stay, and even better cookies!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1006980787-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","27","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilohapril","April W","F657C3FF1CAB4F522F38C2D37A510A8F",,"298570","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","aprilohapril"

The location by the Weerawila lake was excellent with a panoramic view of the lake. Cool breeze constantly blowing across the lake was making the environment very pleasant even though the temperatures were rather high during this time of the year in Sri Lanka. Water in the pool was warm getting heated by the high solar radiation but towards the evening it became a very comfortable warmth for us to enjoy the swim in the pool when the outside temperatures have dropped making the area relatively cool. Surroundings of the pool was extremely pleasant with old trees what resembled to be “Malitta” (Woodfordia fruiticosa) having beautifully gnarled trunks providing ample shade to the wooden decks. Poolside bar ""Hornbill"" was ideal to enjoy a cocktail while chilling in the pool. 

The welcome drink served with the fresh chocolate chip cookie was delicious. We found the room to be very comfortable and liked the interior decorations with drawings of branches of their iconic Rajawarna tree. Red Shank restaurant at the roof top which offered an a-la-carte menu was our choice for dinner and the dinner was excellent. Specially the Chicken liver pate and bouche were for our appreciation. Roof top bar and the restaurant was very quiet and conducive for a relaxing meal with cocktails. 

The breakfast layout in the Spoonbill restaurant was extensive. Interior was like entering the rib cage of a whale full of eats and drinks. Choice was enormous from Western to Indian, Sri Lankan to Eastern. It was indeed a promising layout with a good spread. Service was great!  We had an encounter with a tree frog which has crept into the bath area and settled on the water spout completely hidden but falling down when the tap of the spout was opened. After all we were in the ancient animal kingdom and it was a minor issue as we were able to get a room attendant to take it out unharmed and release it to the compound.","Very good in every aspect","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1005485873-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","148","10999","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307kamalp","Kamal P","5E7FD16938FAFD1460C185E4269C950A",,"528934","Byron Bay, Australia","Byron Bay","307kamalp"

It is an extremely relaxed resort with beautifully maintained surroundings. We had two rooms as our children are now 12+ and they kept our rooms close and they were a perfect location (close to reception) with a beautiful outlook. We had particularly fabulous service from Meneka by the pool, he couldn't do enough for the guests, including walking people to their rooms with umbrellas when it rained, he always made sure everyone was happy and comfortable and was lovely with the kids. The meals were all great, first hotel we have ever stayed in without orange juice at breakfast but plenty of other options. All meals were enjoyable and staff friendly and efficient, including those from the pool bar too. We used the hotels option of a  safari car to visit Yala and they kindly gave us breakfast picnics which was a lovely touch, I recommend doing this. We also got the kids the kids spa treatment of massages and facials which was great value and they thoroughly enjoyed, the spa is good value for a resort and treatments were a high standard and lovely and long. The reception staff (interns) were the only slight weakness, no one really seemed to know what was going on or understand English very well (admittedly a lot better than my Sri-Lankan), we struggled a few times with communication, including when our room wasn't cleaned and they took hours to finally send someone to clean it but a small fault in what was a great stay overall, would still stay again.","Peaceful and relaxing stay with older kids","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1003921153-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"960","742165554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/3c/8c/32/mrsdpw123.jpg","960","5","63","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsdpw123","Mrs DPW","441024BD32A8A8C6C9E4D2F044ACC84A",,"551834","Troon, United Kingdom","Troon","Mrsdpw123"

This could be down to being dog tired when arriving and wanting nothing more than a quick check-in and hot steaming shower...I got neither.
Check-in was staffed by three people, but only one actually doing any work; and his job was made worse by having a bunch of demaning everything South Americians in front of us.  So check in took HALF AN HOUR!   Then we had to do a mini hike to our room, 500m away from reception.   But the kicker was the shower....a rainfall (no thanks) or a gentle spray !!!! warm but absloutely no pressure!
The dinning room is all fancy but watch out, you'll bang your head on the timber 'feature' in the middle as you try to squeeze by.
The buffet was fine, nothing special and I've had better elsewhere.  Same goes for the breakfast.
We totally missed out on the huge, probabily the largest i've seen at a hotel, which was a shame.

This  exquisite hotel not only provides stunning surroundings but also offers a remarkable experience that makes with the spirit of the season. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality of the staff was exceptional and extraordinary, with every corner of the hotel meticulously maintained to ensure cleanliness and comfort. It provides a welcoming atmosphere that makes us relax and enjoy during our stay. The luxurious rooms are designed to provide both comfort and elegance. Avrudu Festival held ensured that our rich cultural heritage is yet standing tall and strong. Endemic to our country and therefore uniqueness of it is unmatched in the world. Special thanks goes to Chairman Mr Saman Upasena and General Manager Mr Dayan , Front Office Manager Yomal and Head of Events Induka for their credible efforts in organizing various events, which helped keep guests happy and active. If you yearn for a relaxed and joyous holiday, I suggest this should be your obvious choice. No place, in my opinion, can overshadow Double Tree by Hilton and you will be in for a memorable and highly pleased holiday from the very second you arrive at this wonderful place.

Thank you for taking the time to share your generous feedback.

We are truly pleased to learn that your honeymoon at Aarunya was both peaceful and memorable. It is always rewarding to know our guests have enjoyed the serene beauty of our surroundings and the distinctive experiences we offer.

We are particularly delighted that the ''Aahaara'' the 9-course traditional Sri Lankan feast at the Mud House was a highlight of your stay. As one of our signature experiences, it is wonderful to hear it left such a lasting impression.

It is also gratifying to know that the Sky Pavilion Villa met your expectations in terms of space and comfort, and that our culinary offerings and cocktails contributed positively to your overall experience.

Thank you as well for your comment regarding the sun exposure on the deck and pool area. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will be taken into account when assisting future guests in selecting their ideal villa.

We sincerely appreciate your kind recommendation and look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back to Aarunya for another exceptional stay.

This is a boutique hotel set in a very nice nature resort north of Kandy with a spectacular view.

A big thank you to the GM, Haleem, for making our stay very memorable. No, was never an answer. He made sure that all our needs and requests were met.  And ran a team that displayed an exceptional level of service in all areas from the room maintenance and cleanliness, down to the excellent F&B service and the tours and transportation.

Highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the Kandy area.

Thank you for sharing such a detailed and thoughtful review of your stay with us! We are truly delighted to hear that you had a serene and memorable experience amidst the natural beauty of Kandy.

Your kind words about our team members, particularly Mr. Haleem, Mr. Sanjeewa, and your personal butler, Mr. Nilantha, have brought smiles to all of us. Their dedication to providing warm, personalized service is a hallmark of our resort, and it’s wonderful to see their efforts so deeply appreciated. We’ll be sure to share your heartfelt compliments with them—they will be thrilled to know how much of an impact they made on your stay.

We’re glad you enjoyed the peaceful ambiance of the private villas and the unique experience of hearing the Azaan from the valley. It’s feedback like yours that inspires us to continuously create meaningful moments for our guests.

It’s also great to hear your praise for our chef’s parathas! We’ll certainly pass on your compliments to him as well—knowing that his culinary creations made such a positive impression means a lot to us.

We’d be honored to welcome you back whenever you need another escape from the hustle and bustle of life. Thank you again for your wonderful words and for choosing our resort for your stay in Kandy.

Wir verbrachten Ende Oktober 4 Nächte in der Sky-Tented Villa. Die Aussicht des Zimmers war unglaublich, das Zimmer entspricht allerdings keinesfalls einem 5-Sterne Hotel. 
Die Ausstattung ist eher durchschnittlich, wenn nicht sogar unterdurchschnittlich und die Klimaanlage hat zeitweise nicht gekühlt. 
Das Badezimmer, insbesondere das Klo waren abgenutzt. 

Eine der größten Enttäuschungen für uns waren allerdings der Service und das Essen. 
Uns wurde bei Ankunft ein persönlicher Butler zugeteilt, welcher allerdings ab dem zweiten Tag frei hatte und nicht mehr zur Verfügung stand. Der angeblich Ersatz reagierte auf unsere Bestellungen erst nach Stunden. 
Das Essen an sich war eher schlecht. Die warmen Speisen waren meist versalzen, in Hähnchen Gerichten musste man aufpassen das viel Knorpel und Knochen enthalten war. Das anschließend bestellte Dessert war Tiefkühl und nicht vollständig aufgetaut.
Auch beim Frühstück gab es Tiefkühlkost - so kam es vor, dass die Muffins die uns serviert wurden noch gefroren waren in der Mitte. Brot und Croissants wirkten oft alt und trocken. 

Uns wurde ein Spa Treatment geschenkt auf Grund des langen Aufenthaltes. Ein wirkliches Spa feeling kam hier in diesem Resort allerdings nicht auf. Das Spa war ein „Raum“ mitten im Freien, die Geräuschkulisse war störend. Von Sägen bis Musik von Nachbarn war alles dabei.

Das Personal sprach teilweise nur schlecht Englisch sodass die Kommunikation manchmal etwas schwierig war. Jedoch waren alle Mitarbeiter immer sehr bemüht uns jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen, nur ist dies leider nicht immer.

Wir würden dieses Hotel insgesamt nicht weiterempfehlen- zumindest nicht für diesen Preis. 
Zudem ist Lage nicht vorteilhaft wenn man Kandy sehen möchte.","Aussicht top, der Rest FLOP","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r978735830-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciarR9860JG","Patricia R","93DCE7EE3474E6B14CD558868192FC29",,,,,"patriciarR9860JG"

What a joy it was to read your words—thank you for sharing such an eloquent and generous reflection of your stay with us.

It’s incredibly special to know that Hilton Yala was not just your introduction to Hilton, but that it left such a lasting impression. We don't take that lightly. To have been part of a travel memory you now count among your very best is the highest compliment we could receive.

Your description of the experience—from our seamless welcome to the immersive safaris and exceptional dining—truly captures the essence of what we aim to create here: effortless, authentic luxury in the heart of nature.

Rimesh will be thrilled to know his deep love for the wild and his storytelling made your safaris so impactful. He’s a true guardian of Yala’s secrets, and we’re proud to have him guiding our guests through its wonders. And Sithulpawwa—ever intuitive behind the wheel—has a gift for being at the right place at the right time. It sounds like you experienced that firsthand.

It was also my very first experience with Hilton, and thanks to Hilton Yala Resort, I’ll definitely be choosing Hilton for my future travels. From the moment we arrived, everything exceeded expectations.

The arrival experience was seamless, and every aspect of our stay—from breakfast, lunch, and dinner to the stunning pool and surroundings—was simply exceptional. The quality of food deserves special mention: it felt like dining at a Michelin-star restaurant. Every item on the menu was thoughtfully prepared and absolutely worth trying.

The service at the hotel is impeccable. Every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly, helpful, and genuinely passionate about making our stay unforgettable.

A special thanks goes to our ranger, Rimesh. He’s a walking encyclopedia—deeply knowledgeable about Sri Lanka’s wildlife, birds, and nature. We joined him on three safaris, and each time was a unique and educational experience. The hotel is incredibly lucky to have him, and I highly recommend requesting him for your safari experience—he’s not just a guide, but a truly remarkable person.

I’d also like to acknowledge our safari jeep driver, Sithulpawwa. He’s the best safari driver I’ve encountered—thanks to his skills and instincts, we spotted every type of animal and were always among the first to reach key locations.

If I could give more than five stars, I absolutely would. Hilton Yala Resort delivers a level of hospitality that goes beyond expectations.

Thank you so much for sharing such a vivid and beautifully written account of your stay with us at Hilton Yala. It was truly a pleasure to read, and I know our entire team will be delighted by your kind words.

We’re thrilled that your time with us left such an impression—from the moment of arrival to every thoughtful interaction thereafter. Your appreciation for the small details, from the cold towels to the birdsong and even the technology in your room, speaks volumes about your eye for meaningful experiences.

Room 306 sounds like it was the perfect base for your Yala adventure! We’re glad it offered you both comfort and inspiration, and your tip on the Merlin bird app will surely inspire other guests to engage with the natural surroundings just as you did.

Your kind recognition of Gitanjali’s leadership and the passion of team members like Sajith, Jerome, and Bodika truly means a lot. Their dedication to creating personalized, immersive moments for our guests is at the very heart of what we do. I will personally ensure your feedback is shared with them—they’ll be honored to know they helped shape your experience so memorably.

The anecdotes you shared, from monkeys making a surprise visit to the custom Indian banquet, add such rich texture to your story—and are exactly the kind of memories we hope every guest leaves with. We’re also deeply pleased that your safaris exceeded expectations and that the connection with our in-house ranger team added depth and discovery to your journey.

It means so much to us that you would recommend Hilton Yala so highly. You brought our space to life through your words, and we hope the doors of 306—and the wild magic of Yala—call you back again someday.

I don’t write hotel reviews easily but just felt that I had to with this resort. 

As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff members offering cold towels & a cold drink & we were immediately made to feel welcome. This wasn’t a one off as the genuine smiles & greetings continued every day we stayed at the hotel. Whenever we returned back after our safaris we were welcomed by staff offering cold towels which were very welcome to cool down & wipe off the dust.

The General Manager, Gitanjali was very present in the hotel & made sure that she chatted to guests about their stay at her hotel. She had obviously carefully chosen & trained her staff to the highest standards & they clearly liked & respected her.

As the hotel is located in the Yala National Park, the safety of guests is treated very seriously by the staff. On arrival we had a safety briefing by one of the hotel rangers who emphasised that wild animals can & do wander through the resort. There is a track through the resort which is an ‘animal highway’ & there are raised walkways for the guests to use during daylight hours. Guests are not permitted to walk from their rooms to the main block & restaurant after dark but there are buggies that can be requested by calling reception. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a buggy whenever we called from our room. 

Now onto our room! We stayed in room 306 …….. where do I start? It was fabulous. The super king bed was really comfortable. We had a pillow menu but didn’t need to try any others as the ones on the bed were lovely. 
The room had a sitting area with a large TV that we only switched on once in the entire week. It had a dressing area leading to a huge bathroom with twin sinks, a stand alone bath tub & a large walk in shower. Now the toilet was definitely a talking point! It was a high tech Japanese lavatory with a sensor that opened the lid as you opened the cubicle door. It had a heated seat (not completely necessary when it’s 30 degrees!) it also had controls to wash your nether regions - front or back! It also had a drier too. 

There was a mini bar with some pay-for items along with complimentary items such as sodas that were replaced every day, along with bottles of water. We did have to call to ask for our sodas to be replaced a couple of times but this was a minor issue which was rectified quickly. If you like a cheeky drink in your room then I’d recommend you take any spirits with you as the mini bar bottles were very pricy. 

Outside there was a good sized private pool with a couple of sunloungers & a seating area. It was surrounded by trees & shrubs & we became obsessed with identifying the many birds from their songs using the Merlin bird ID app which I use a lot at home (highly recommend it but you will become addicted!) 

We also had visits from chipmunks & small lizards outside & hoped to see the residents monkeys but they didn’t make a visit to our pool area although we saw them a few times on the roof at the main hotel block. A couple of girls who were on the first safari with us didn’t heed the warnings to keep their patio door closed when they arrived & had an afternoon nap until they were woken by 10 monkeys exploring their room & knocking over their toiletries in the bathroom! A valuable lesson learned. 

The main pool area is large & well laid out but we didn’t actually use it. We had a safari every day either morning or afternoon ( a couple of days we did both) & just chilled around our own pool before or after we went out. 

The food was fabulous & the Executive Chef Jerome was very visible in the restaurant, chatting to guests & asking whether there was anything special they would like eat. He asked us to challenge him & his team with what we would love for dinner so they could prepare us a special meal on one of the evenings. My husband loves hot & spicy food while I’m the opposite. We were presented with an Indian banquet with starters & mains to suit our individual tastes. It was absolutely delicious.

Even when he was on his days off Jerome had briefed the deputy chef & he introduced himself to us to ask what we would like to have prepared for us on our last night. We were blown away by this level of service & once again had a fabulous banquet made especially for us. 

Now onto our main reason for visiting Yala - the safaris. I’m a keen photographer & love wildlife. We were lucky enough to visit Tanzania two years ago where we went on amazing safaris in three different National parks. We had a fantastic time & to be honest we were warned that we might feel disappointed with a Sri Lankan safari after an African one. This was not the case - they were just very different & special. 

My husband researched the best places to visit in Sri Lanka & found the Hilton Yala Resort which is one of a very few that are located inside Yala National Park itself. It employs its own highly trained rangers & offers different safaris to suit the guests. It is possible to book your own safaris from outside the hotel if you book the hotel on a different package but I would highly recommend using the hotel’s own safaris. There are many private safari companies but I seriously doubt if many of them have such highly trained rangers/trackers with the knowledge & expertise that we received. 

The hotel package we booked included one safari per night we stayed in the hotel. Our assigned ranger was called Saj (Sajith) & we were so lucky to have him & our driver Bodika for the duration of our stay. Saj’s knowledge & enthusiasm for the wildlife was second to none & we learned so much from him. He was able to answer all our questions & appeared to take genuine pleasure from our interest & enthusiasm for his country & its native wildlife. He was also a keen photographer himself so understood about the best positions to position the vehicle for camera angles & lighting & directed the driver where to stop. Our driver Bodika was fabulous! His driving skills were amazing & it was so much fun on the rougher tracks in the park - better than a roller coaster! 

Saj was able to find us the most amazing wildlife including leopards ( including two super-cute cubs!). To add to the experience he was also able to identify the adult leopards by name. The cubs won't be named until they reach adulthood & have territories of their own. We saw Elephants, Crocodiles, Golden Jackals & even a Sloth Bear, along with so many different types of birds - all identified by Saj. I was in heaven! I managed to take some wonderful photos which I’m still going through & enjoying the adventure all over again.

We had an outstanding holiday & would highly recommend the Hilton Yala Resort to anybody who loves the luxury of a fabulous hotel immersed in nature. We would love to return one day.","Wonderful safari hotel in stunning location with fabulous staff!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1010201508-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","26","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjmc63","kjmc63","BFFA29A5721CB295E5AF4218F410C8E5",,"186411","Leeds, United Kingdom","Leeds","kjmc63"

Thank you ever so much for taking the time to share such a heartfelt and beautifully detailed review of your stay with us at Hilton Yala.

It was truly our pleasure to host you and we're thrilled to know your first visit to Sri Lanka—and your first experience with Hilton Yala—was nothing short of exceptional. We’re so pleased that the stunning setting, seamlessly blending the wild beauty of Yala with the comforts of a luxury resort, made for the perfect base for your safaris and serene poolside relaxation.

While we regret the initial hiccup with the room allocation, we’re grateful for your gracious understanding and so glad we were able to move you to the room of your choice overlooking the elephant trail. It’s wonderful to know you enjoyed the space, ambience, and comforts of the room, and that our team made you feel right at home with thoughtful service touches throughout.

Your kind words about our dining experiences—especially your compliments on the presentation and flavor of the dishes, as well as the flexibility extended by our culinary team—have been shared with our chefs, who were truly delighted to know they helped elevate your stay. And thank you for recognizing the little gestures from our poolside and housekeeping teams. I’ll be sure to personally pass on your special mention to Chanaka—he’ll be overjoyed to hear he made such a lasting impression.

We also appreciate your feedback on the spa, gym, and safari experience. We wholeheartedly agree that having a dedicated ranger adds an entirely new dimension to exploring the park, and we’re delighted you found the experience enriching and worth the extra value.

On behalf of the entire Hilton Yala family, thank you once again for choosing to spend your Sri Lankan adventure with us. Your kind words truly energize our team to keep doing what we love—creating unforgettable memories for guests like you. We very much look forward to welcoming you back, hopefully in the near future.

The reviews and photos that you see on Trip Advisor paints a true picture of the resort and experience and it did not disappoint.
This was our first visit to Sri Lanka and we wanted to stay somewhere close to the National Park so that we could do the odd safari or two, whilst also relaxing by the pool of the main resort. The location was ideal, with it being right in the National Park
and only a short drive away to the main entrance of block 1. 
Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted with a cold towel and welcome drink and then shown into the main entrance to the hotel, through a huge doorway that led into the reception, lounge and bar area. From here, there are floor to ceiling windows with a view over the resort, pool area and Indian ocean, giving a true wow factor.

Having pre-selected our room through the Hilton app 24 hours prior to arrival to be close to the elephant trail, we were then taken by buggy to our room. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded to a premium room with plunge pool.
Unfortunately, our pre-selection hadn’t been noted and we were allocated a room next to the main pool. We raised this with the hotel team and were initially told that the rooms are allocated 48 hours in advance and therefore they hadn’t received our request. This was swiftly resolved and we were then taken to the pre-selected room.
The room was very luxurious, with plenty of space, soft furnishings and mood lighting. The bed was very comfortable with a pillow menu at your disposal. The bathroom had twin sinks, rainfall shower, bathtub and a Toto toilet. The terrace had a table and chairs, two sun loungers, a sofa and the plunge pool. It overlooked the elephant trail, that runs through the hotel grounds and whilst there was evidence of wild animals having walked past, we didn’t see any during our stay.
The room was cleaned daily with a turn down service in the evening.

We spent most of our time by the main pool and as most guests are here for the National Park and safaris, it was mostly quiet and felt like our own private pool at times. There were plenty of sun loungers and the pool staff were always very friendly and greeted you with a warm welcome and smile.

The food offered in the hotel is up there with some of the best food we have had and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. As HH Diamond members, we were upgraded from continental to full breakfast, along with 25% off food and spa treatments. For breakfast, you can order a variety of dishes a-la-carte and there is also a small buffet area with pastries and cereal. Each dish was beautifully presented and was delicious. Our personal favourites were the hummus on rye toast and French toast! All meals are served in the Dhira restaurant, which is next to the reception and bar area. There is another restaurant on the ground floor, near the main pool, however this was not used during our stay as most guests are seated in the Dhira restaurant. 
For evening meals, you have the option to choose from a variety of menus offering local and international dishes. All meals were delicious and again, well presented. We were also encouraged to order dishes off menu, as the head chef encouraged you to eat whatever you fancied!
We would have the occasional lunch sat by the pool area and the food was equally well presented.

The spa and gym are well appointed and we used both during our stay. The spa treatments were great and the staff very welcoming.

We went on two morning safaris and were able to see all that the National Park has to offer. We decided to book the safari directly with the hotel and whilst more expensive than other options available through Viator or other similar sites, it is worth paying the extra money. We had our own private vehicle and ranger and were given breakfast boxes whilst in the park. Having your own personal ranger allowed you to learn more about the park and resident animals. 

What really stood out for us during our stay, was the staff. Every single member of the Hilton Yala team were welcoming and friendly. Walking to the pool or restaurant in the morning, the room cleaners, gardeners, pool staff, buggy drivers would all stop, smile and say good morning as we walked past. It is therefore very difficult to name individual staff members. Having said that, Chanaka from the F&B team really set the tone for our stay. He was always kind and happy to serve our breakfast or dinner and would also encourage us to order as much as we wanted. 

Thank you Hilton Yala team for making our stay truly memorable and we will no doubt return in the near future.","True luxury in the heart of the Yala National Park","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1009254291-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"3024","804853739","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/f9/17/eb/andrew0116.jpg","3024","0","17","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew0116","Andrew0116","C723B9CC4EA9453F67B969B1BECDD46B",,,,,"Andrew0116"

Thank you so much for your glowing review and for sharing such thoughtful reflections on your stay with us at Hilton Yala National Park.

It was truly an honor to welcome you, and we're overjoyed to know that your time here was among the best hotel experiences you've had. From the peaceful setting of the villas to the culinary offerings and attentive service, we’re thrilled that so many elements came together to create a memorable escape for you.

Your kind mention of the warm welcome, our General Manager Ms. Gitanjali Chakravarthy, and our Executive Chef means a great deal to all of us. We believe genuine guest engagement is the heart of hospitality, and it’s wonderful to know that this personal connection made such a positive impression on you. I’ll also make sure Chamara and the rest of the team hear your kind words — they’ll be delighted.

We wholeheartedly agree — two nights is never quite enough to truly unwind and explore all that Yala has to offer. We do hope you'll return for a longer stay next time, perhaps to experience a safari and spend more days immersed in the tranquility of the jungle.

Until then, thank you once again for your kind words and trust in Hilton. It was a pleasure having you with us.

The site is very beautiful with villas set amongst trees arranged around a large swimming pool.  We stayed only two nights and wished we had stayed a lot longer.  The resort organises tours of the Yala National Park and had we had more time we would have done some of these.  From the warm greeting we had as we stepped out of our car we were struck by the quality of the staff and their warmth.  We had several long chats with the General Manager, Ms Gitanjali Chakravarthy, who was interested in our comments and feedback on the hotel.  The executive chef also circulated among guest seeking feedback.  This sort of personal engagement with guests is very impressive and is, no doubt, a reason why this hotel is so good.

What a joy it was to read your review — thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us in such detail.

We are truly humbled by your kind words and thrilled that Hilton Yala was the highlight of your Sri Lanka journey. From the moment you entered our ""Jurassic Park"" inspired lobby to the peaceful moments in your Premium King Pool Villa, it sounds like you embraced every part of the adventure — and that’s exactly what we hope for every guest.

Your appreciation of the unique design, the untouched natural setting, and our commitment to preserving the surrounding wildlife means the world to us. While we wish you’d spotted one of our gentle giants on the path near your villa, we’re glad you felt the magic of their presence all the same.

It’s wonderful to hear that our team was able to support you and your family, especially with the little touches like the kids’ arrangements and buggy rides. We always aim to create a space where families can relax, connect, and truly feel cared for.

Thank you also for recognizing the quality of our dining experience and our commitment to hospitality. Your loyalty to Hilton is something we never take for granted, and heartfelt feedback like yours is exactly what motivates us to keep delivering unforgettable moments.

We sincerely hope to welcome you and your family back for another remarkable stay in the wild beauty of Yala.

I had high expectations for this one and oh boy what a stunning hotel. 

The hotel is fairly new and is in the middle of the safari park, not even surrounded by fences or gates, this to maintain it's natural habitat with the animals. Elephants pass by walking, and sometimes sneak into the kitchen, and there's even a pond where a crocodile was spotted.

The big door of the lobby looked like you entered Jurassic Park and it had grey stone elements and high ceilings, only the T rex was missing. Massive floor to ceiling windows overlook the resort and sea. We received a short briefing from a ranger ref security and safety and were told not to leave the rooms ourselves after 6pm.

We were upgraded to Premium king pool villa and i let the pics speak for itself. Massive bathroom with tub and shower, and space where every woman (and man) can dream off. Kids bed was also arranged and 1 sofabed was installed. 

Large terrace with sunloungers and the plungepool. We were located right on the corner of the path were elephants pass through. (However none spotted during our stay).

Around 40 rooms big this resort serves dinner and breakfast in the main resto, next to the lobby.  A la carte is served and we received HH discount.

The next day we did Yala safari's with a private driver, not done through the resort as i found prices were very high. 

After that we relaxed in the massive pool with sunbeds in the water, several jacuzzi sections and a kidspool. Don't be afraid when you see a snake swimming as they're not harmfull :-) the pool seemed endless.

The resort also organises morning walks to the beach (rocks) with its high dunes and massive waves. Not much more to do here.

This hotel was the hilight of our Sri Lanka trip and so well organised and neat. Staff were friendly and helpfull with the kids (buggy drive) and the food was of high quality. 

Hotels like these remind me why i stay loyal to to Hilton brand, as now and then you find a real gem.","This place feels like you're in Jurassic Park :-)","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1003923301-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,,,,,"1","45","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72karels","Karel S","EFBC1B114521C870B2B4FC8828DE484D",,,,,"72karels"

It is truly an honour and a heartfelt privilege to read your beautiful words—and to welcome you back for your third visit in just six months. Guests like you are the very soul of Hilton Yala, and I cannot thank you enough for the trust, loyalty, and warmth you continue to show our team.

From the moment we first had the pleasure of hosting you, your passion for wildlife, eye for detail, and appreciation for Sri Lanka’s natural and cultural heritage have inspired us. Your vivid description of the premium villa, the bespoke amenities, and the experience of immersing in the buffer zone’s serene wilderness is deeply appreciated—and beautifully articulated. It is clear this place resonates with you on a very personal level, and that means the world to all of us.

Chef Jerome and his team will be overjoyed by your praise—he leads his culinary brigade with both passion and precision, and to know it has become a highlight of your visits is incredibly rewarding. Indika and the F&B team, our housekeeping and buggy associates, security colleagues including Chandima, and everyone across Front Office join me in thanking you for the special recognition.

Of course, your words for Sajith and the Ranger Team are especially meaningful. We all know your love for wildlife runs deep—and to hear that this visit brought four leopard sightings and rich wildlife encounters is thrilling. You are not just a guest to our Rangers; you are a kindred spirit in the field, and their respect for you is genuine and heartfelt.

The way you’ve described the fishing experience, dune walks, and bush walks captures what we hope every guest comes to understand—that Hilton Yala is more than a resort, it’s a place to reconnect with nature, self, and soul. The childlike wonder you described during the fishing trip brought a smile to all our faces.

As someone who knows Sri Lanka intimately and has seen the world, your praise means more than we can express. Thank you for recognizing the sincerity of Sri Lankan hospitality, and for letting us be part of your journey home, in every sense of the word.

We look forward to welcoming you back soon—with more wildlife, more stories, and many more memories to share.

With deepest gratitude and warmest regards,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Palatupana, Yala National Park 95000 Sri Lanka","Palatupana","Sri Lanka","95000",,,,"26194654","6.257097","Palatupana, Yala National Park","81.40043","Hilton Yala Resort","191","4.8","5","0","3","6","177","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3748686-d26194654-Reviews-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html","https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/kdwyahi-hilton-yala-resort/","2025-04-20","OTHER","5","Just book and go.

There's an absolutely great reason why we will visit often. 
The resort is a stunningly architecturally designed, lovely place in lush surroundings in the Yala buffer zone, sensitive to protect its environs. The luxury is next level, love the amazing and superb premium villa with private plunge pool, hi tech and tastefully crafted and  luxuriously appointed interior, amenities and  unsurpassed comfort. 
The cuisine is extraordinary - Exec chef Jerome and team delight at every meal, the service is exceptional- Front office (Vino and team including the tireless buggy drivers), F&B (Indika and team), Housekeeping, Security (Chandima and team) and of course all graciously managed by the GM- Gitanjali. The spa and gym are world class as well.
But as a keen life long wildlife enthusiast, the primary reason for my unswerving loyalty  is the     superb best in class skill, utterly amazing knowledge and client focus of the Ranger Team,  built, led and nurtured by Sajith, the Head Ranger.
This visit yielded four separate and breathtaking leopard sightings deep in the jungle in addition to several large and smaller mammal sightings, stunning variety of bird life (including endangered species) sightings and the various  rich eco-systems.
I also went on a fishing excursion that is offered,  that was absolutely fabulous and enjoyable (Ranger accompanied), appreciating the National Park from a very different perspective from the warm Indian Ocean,  spotting wildlife on the beach at dawn and subsequent childlike jubilation reeling in Trevally, Barracuda and other species while fighting to bring in King Mackerel (locally prized Seer).  Another couple of great experiences that are also offered are the Ranger accompanied Dune Walks and Bush Walks. These experiences will keep your senses on edge in a delightful way. Totally immersed in nature, as intended.
In context, my wife and I grew up in Sri Lanka and know the land of our birth. We are Americans and I have been extremely fortunate to travel to almost seventy countries with work and on holidays. 
Hilton Yala Resort embodies many facets of the best that Sri Lanka offers including extraordinary and legendary Sri Lankan hospitality and genuine friendliness.","Wonderful and Serendipitous Experiences!","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1003552178-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"768","442092847","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/59/cd/2f/rksk1.jpg","768","2","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKSK1","RKSK1","B490EBE3DD7D7F119B85FF9B31BF3DB4",,"40894","South Portland, Maine","South Portland","RKSK1"

Thank you ever so much for your beautifully written review and for choosing to spend five nights with us at Hilton Yala.

We are truly delighted that your stay was filled with peace, connection to nature, and authentic Sri Lankan hospitality. It brings us immense joy to know you appreciated the architectural design, your private pool suite, and the serenity of our communal pool—a perfect way to unwind after an early morning safari.

Your kind words for our team, from Ms. Gitanjali and Chef Jerome to our waitstaff, spa therapists, buggy drivers, and housekeeping colleagues, mean the world to us. We are incredibly proud of the genuine warmth and attentiveness they bring to each guest interaction, and your recognition will be shared with great pride.

It was a pleasure having you with us during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations. Including our guests in these meaningful traditions is something we hold dear, and we’re thrilled that you enjoyed both the reverence and the joyful moments—especially “pin the eye on the elephant” 🐘!

Though the elusive leopard remained hidden this time, we're glad your personal safari with our ranger still offered memorable wildlife encounters. We hope there will be another opportunity for you to return and perhaps catch sight of one on your next visit.

Thank you once again for your generous recommendation and for making us a part of your Sri Lankan holiday memories. We look forward to welcoming you back to Hilton Yala for another unforgettable escape in the wild.

The fresh architectural design of the resort is reflected in the high quality of the large room/suite we had (with its own pool). The large communal pool was a wonderful place to languish away the day after an early morning safari. 

All the hotel staff, from Gitanjali the General Manager, Jerome the head chef, our two beautiful waitresses,  the pool staff, the buggy drivers, the housekeeping staff and the two women in the spa who gave us super massages, could not have been more welcoming and friendly. They all took time to speak to us regularly in the kind and gentle nature of the Sri Lankan character. 

We felt honoured to be included in the hotel’s Sri Lankan New Year rituals and activities, mixing with hotel staff and some hotel guests. At times reverential and then some fun activities such as pin the eye of the elephant 🐘. 

Our Safari was very personal with just the two of us and our knowledgeable ranger.  We saw many fine examples of Sri Lankan wildlife, although we missed out on spotting a leopard, but that is in the nature of a safari and trying to spot an elusive wild cat such as this. 

We can highly recommend this beautiful resort. We loved it.

Thank you sincerely for such a spectacular and heartfelt review!

We are truly delighted that your stay at Hilton Yala was filled with memorable experiences—from the breathtaking natural surroundings and spacious, artfully designed rooms to the thrilling safari encounters and vibrant birdlife. It's a privilege to operate within the Yala National Park buffer zone, and hearing that you had the chance to witness elephants and leopards adds even more joy to your story.

We are especially touched by your generous praise for our team. Chef Jerome will be thrilled to know his culinary creations left such a lasting impression, and your kind words for Ms. Gitanjali and the entire team are deeply appreciated. It’s their passion and genuine hospitality that create the “next level” warmth you so kindly mentioned—and we’re proud that it helped make your stay truly exceptional.

The spa is amazing, and the pool is gorgeous!
Second last, OMG the restaurant. Chief Chef Jerome is a magician on top of what clearly is a man with incredible skill and talent. Hilton Yala could or should be a destination resort just to indulge in his amazing creations.

Quite simply the most beautiful hotel you could wish to stay. Where do i start.....

Location - stunning and tranquil setting with unspoilt ocean views from every view. The journey to the east coast is well worth the effort, and forgotten as you step through the door.

Facilities - quietly understated, but exceptional quality and simply luxurious. Quiet and secluded rooms tastefully spread across manicured grounds adds to a feeling of total peace and relaxation. Attention to detail ensures everything you could need is provided (and those that you didn't think you needed!)

Food - mind-blowing - creative dining with an expansive ever-changing menu; prepared with care and attention by the most creative and friendly team of talented chefs; presented consistently beautifully; and with a quality and range of flavours that was a delight to enjoy at every meal.

But what makes this hotel truly special are the staff - every member of staff goes above and beyond to make each guest feel welcome. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by welcoming smiling staff, to the time we left and they gathered to wave us off like part of the family, each member of staff goes far beyond their roles. Special mention needs to go to Sajeev for his care and attention to us both throughout our stay. And also a big thank you to Santha, Usara, Yassa, Rasini and Sathiya, but while those are only the names we remember, I am grateful to every member of the Uga Bay team - you have created a unique environment that helps create memories that will last.

Will we return? Without hesitation. Sajeev and team, we will see you again soon!","The closest place to paradise","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1008601268-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","17","58","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianhu","brianhu","EBE7E354F8E83E75FDCA93F84E0BB471",,"186364","Sheffield, United Kingdom","Sheffield","brianhu"

From the reservation team in Colombo, notably Mr Jacques Anandappa and Mr Jithendra Abeysinghe and the reception team at the hotel, Professionalism was the order of the day. All arrangements were seamless and smooth and we left after a three nights stay with further unforgettable memories. The Ocean Studio King room where we stayed was spacious and luxuriously furnished with all modern amenities and has a direct view of the ocean. To start the day with a stroll on the   pristine white sandy beach and watch the Sun rise simply takes your breath away. During your stroll you may have the good fortune of meeting the local fishermen, hauling in their overnight catch. Boat rides and water sports are on offer from private companies. The pool is very inviting with crystal clear water and blue as the sky. The pool bar serves up some mouth watering bites and delicious cocktails. The food that is served in the restaurant is unbelievably delightful. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous and caters for all palates with English, continental and Asian cuisine as well as a Sri Lankan corner. Nothing is too much for the Staff. If you need something extra, all you have to do is just ask Ramani, the restaurant Hostess, who will do her utmost to produce it for you. The dinner buffet's are no different with live stations displaying the chefs culinary prowess. In a hotel where all staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful, it is difficult to single out individuals for praise. However, during this stay, there were a few staff who stood out for us, we  would like to mention by name. Chef Hismath who was very obliging and produced the most wonderful Dosa for me. Chef Thusal, Trainee chef Sanuji  and waiter Munas were the others who were very helpful and obliging. Hostess Ramani with her cheerful smile was always there to welcome us into the restaurant and attended to all our needs. Last, but by no means least, Mr Neranjan Morais the General Manager who was very helpful and always visible in the background. 
All in all. it was another wonderful holiday for my wife and I, and counting the days when we could go there again.","Memorable Holiday at a Luxurious Beach Resort","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1008388743-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","11","79","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thambap","thambap","0D6F281EF20AB192CDA3871677F218B7",,"609066","Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom","Bishops Stortford","thambap"

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at Uga Bay. We are truly sorry to hear about your experience.

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the situation you encountered. We take such matters extremely seriously, and upon learning of your complaint, we immediately launched a thorough investigation involving our security team and relevant personnel. This included a detailed review of access logs, staff interviews, and a comprehensive search of the room and surrounding areas.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the investigation did not yield any evidence to substantiate the claim of theft. While we understand this may not be the outcome you hoped for, we want to assure you that we explored every possible avenue to uncover what happened. We also understand that you discovered the alleged loss of money several hours after checking out of the property. Given the time that had elapsed and the locations you may have visited after leaving Uga Bay, it is challenging to determine where the money was lost. 

As a policy, during check-in, we inform all our guests that in-room safes are provided for the secure storage of valuable items. Utilizing this facility is always the best way to ensure the safety of your belongings.

We strive to provide the highest level of service and support to all our guests, and we are disappointed to learn that we fell short of your expectations in this instance. Your feedback is valuable, and we will use it to improve our internal processes and staff training to ensure a better experience for our guests in the future.

We value your patronage and hope that this unfortunate incident will not deter you from considering Uga Bay in the future. We would welcome the opportunity to provide you with the exceptional experience that our guests have come to expect. Please feel free to contact us directly if you would like to discuss this matter further.

Sincerely,

Ramli Ghaffoor

So, now about positive points - the staff met us friendly with local traditions , we were checked in a nice room at the second floor. Aaaaaall staff are so  kindly, open-minded and service was excellent- in the restarant, on the beach - everywhere we were surrounded by care! Also, I would like to mention Sajeevu, Nissanka, Anura - thank you so much!  Food is tatsty , take the seafood plato on the beach  - it's really nice.  Thank you for all!

Es precioso... estuvimos en habitaciones con vista a la playa y era un lujo de comodidad, y de vistas.
La comida es algo increible... El desayuno super completo y agradable y la cena a la carta pero como si fuera un menú degustación con un montón de platos  para ir disfrutando. Un nivel de presentación y de calidad muy alto. Los niños tienen una gran variedad en el menú infantil pero también pueden pedir a la carta de los adultos si lo prefieren. 
El único inconveniente fue  la lentitud en la cena, que tardaban mucho en sacar los platos... pero valía la pena la espera. Cenamos las dos noches al aire libre al lado de la piscina y el ambiente es super agradable. 
La piscina que tienen es preciosa y de tipo infíniti, así que te bañas viendo el mar que lo tienes detrás.... 
Hubo música en vivo (pianista tocando) y el personal super amable todo el tiempo. 
Tienen un chiringuito para comidas, que está mirando al mar y se come muy bien y agradable con la brisa marina... 
La playa muy muy vacía y bonita... la disfrutamos mucho y cogimos padel surf y canoas para divertirnos con los niños.

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the General Manager himself, setting the tone for a truly special stay. At the reception, Heshani greeted us with the brightest smile every day, making us feel right at home. As part of a beautiful welcome tradition, we lit an oil lamp — symbolizing the guests bringing more light into their home — a gesture that touched our hearts.

Day two was full of sunshine, laughter, and friendship. We spent the entire day at the beach with Lali, who went above and beyond to make sure we had the best time. From organizing beach volleyball and joining us in a lively karaoke session, to playing pool and arranging a cozy lunch, Lali made the day feel magical.

Speaking of lunch — we had the pleasure of meeting the head chef, who personally prepared a mouthwatering meal for us. The chicken curry, two types of dhal, vegetables, and rice were not only delicious but made with such warmth and hospitality.

Thank you, Mandara Resort, for creating such a memorable stay.

They also had live music, so we were struggling a bit to talk with each other. The buffet was good, and some good choices of wine as well.

Thank you for your wonderfully detailed review — what a treat it was to read! We’re so pleased you decided to stay inside the Fort this time and that Fort Bazaar became a highlight of your visit.

It’s lovely to hear that you enjoyed the unique charm of Galle Fort, from the vibrant streets to the rich history just waiting to be explored. 

We’re also glad you made the most of the little perks like afternoon tea, Social Hour, and time by the pool. At Fort Bazaar, we aim to offer a relaxed, personal experience, and it's rewarding to know it resonated with you.

We look forward to welcoming you back again — whether with family, friends, or on a quiet escape just for you.

The food at the Fort Bazaar is excellent, Shashik the chef , takes huge pride in his work and was very good at mingling with the guests. On a half board  basis we had complementary tea and freshly made cake and biscuits every day and happy hour was an utter bonus!  The room  and bathroom were beautifully done, exceptionally clean, with excellent coffee and tea facilities, fridge etc too.  The pool is a real oasis, make sure you have some time to chill out there, towels etc included by the way. It's a small, boutique hotel so it feels like every guests matters.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay with us.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
We were concerned to see a 1-star rating, particularly as your feedback centers around the champagne—which, as was clearly communicated by our team, including at the time of delivery and again at checkout, is a chargeable item.
 
Transparency is very important to us, and we make every effort to ensure guests are fully informed about any additional charges. In this instance, our staff acted appropriately and made sure the pricing was clear. While we regret that there may have been a misunderstanding, we do not feel this incident fairly reflects the overall quality of service and hospitality we strive to provide.
 
We welcome all feedback, including criticism, as it helps us continue to improve. If there’s anything further you'd like to discuss, we’d be happy to speak with you directly. Please feel free to reach out to us at feedback@teardrop-hotels.com

Part of the Teardrop hotels group, we had already stayed at Goatfell earlier this trip. Fort Bazaar was equally as spectacular. Beautiful rooms with a very comfortable bed. We made use of the spa and had very good massages. The hotel has several different areas to relax and soak up the atmosphere- at the front of the hotel for the Galle vibe or in the courtyard for peace. The swimming pool brought some relief to the humid climate.
The staff were friendly, very helpful and attentive.

After having a fairly traumatic experience at a different hotel we arrived and were immediately put at ease by the staff. They were expecting us and even though we couldn't access our room right away we were given cold drinks and allowed to use the hotel amenities while we waited. 

Perfectly located inside Galle Fort the hotel is a welcome respite after a busy 3 week vacation. We stayed in one of the suites near the library upstairs and loved the ""push for champagne"" button. The room was light and spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous. The perfect luxury end to our honeymoon. 

We went on the walking tour offered by the hotel which was a fantastic way to start our morning. Our guide was knowledgeable and shared lots of their own personal history as well. 

We also took advantage of the social hour the hotel offers. The arrack attack was a particular fave of ours! Meeting other guests and making friends with other travellers. This is such a lovely touch and something we loved. 

The food at the hotel (both breakfast and suppers) was spectacular. A wide variety on offer and when I mentioned how much I loved the papaya, additional papaya was brought the next morning. 

Could not fault our experience - which I have to say was the same across other teardrop properties. We were sad to end the trip, but will most definitely be back.

WOW indeed — thank you so much for this incredible review! We’re genuinely touched by your kind words and thrilled to hear that Fort Bazaar, and your overall Teardrop Journey, exceeded expectations for the whole family.

It’s wonderful to know the Upper Family Suite felt like a home away from home, and that the pool, Social Hour, and mocktails were a hit with both adults and kids! Your feedback about the curated experiences means a lot. We put a lot of thought into crafting activities that are immersive, authentic, and family-friendly, and it’s so rewarding to hear how much they were enjoyed.

Fort Bazaar exceeded all my expectations! It was simply wonderful. Everything about it was perfect. 
We are a family of four and stayed in the Upper family Suite, which was the most beautiful room. The whole hotel is beautiful in fact. We stayed three nights and easily could have stayed longer.

We really loved the pool area and could have spent all day there, if there hadn't been so much to do! 

A massive highlight was returning at 5 for the Happy Hour - the atmosphere was brilliant and the drinks (including huge kids mocktails) fantastic.

We stayed at 5 teardrop hotels (they are all fantastic) and did a Teardrop Journey - which I REALLY recommend.
Our journey included many activities. At Fort Bazaar we loved the guided 12k cycling train through paddy fields, a visit to a rock temple and a guided hike through the Kanneliya rainforest. I think the kids favourite activity was the traditional mask carving and mask painting at a real gallery with an artist in the Fort.

 We would never have found these activities if it wasn't for Teardrop suggesting/organising. These were all carefully curated for families in mind and our kids were incredibly sad to leave.

The food was fantastic, and despite all the options in Galle we ate dinner at Nine Skies 2 out of our 3 nights.  

In summary, this was a fantastic hotel to stay - we return tomorrow if we could. I didn't see any better option in Galle.

Excellent ambience with church services right next door, morning and night. Church bells ring every half hour from 5:30am until service at 7am (Saturday). I used to fall asleep in church when I was a kid, but try as I may, there was no sleeping through this service.

My latest visit was my first since COVID and the political problems recently experienced in Sri Lanka. Thankfully things are now much improved

The apartments are no longer operating as a full-service hotel, but none the worse for that. The ground floor restaurant is now equipped as a gym with a range of torture equipment. The former roof top restaurant is used as a casual seating area to sit and watch the sun go down

There are many places to eat locally. However, the apartments are well equipped with hob, microwave, grill, toaster, kettle, fridge, crockery, cutlery, pans and basic cleaning materials, making self-catering a good option. There are no large supermarkets nearby but getting a tuk tuk to stock up on groceries at one of the chain stores in the area (Keele’s or Arpico) is easy and cheap. Using Apps such as Pickme or Uber is a convenient and safe way to book a ride. You can also arrange delivery of “take away” food and groceries using the Apps.

Pescatarians should not miss a visit to the famous Negombo Fish market

The main feature of the apartments is the location. Front line with unobstructed views of the Indian Ocean. Some reviewers have mentioned that they have been disturbed by the noise from the Holy Rosary Church which is next door and this is true. Sri Lankans start the day early, and you will hear a short ring of one bell starting at 5:30 am and repeating at key times of the day. Also singing and praying, preaching and eulogising and the slow beat of drums on a day when there is a funeral. And yes, there are the cawing cries of rooks/crows to contend with. But you will also hear youngsters after school playing cricket or soccer and flying their kites and most of all, the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean on the beach below

The apartments are exceptionally spacious and layouts vary. Décor and furniture the same throughout. All have kitchen, lounge/diner, bedroom and shower room. There is also a furnished balcony. Some of the furniture and fittings are beginning to look a little faded and tired. But the staff work tirelessly to ensure that the place is kept clean and they will provide housekeeping on request. Any issues in the apartment are dealt with quickly. 

Rooms are kept cool with A/C and ceiling fans in the lounge and bedroom and a further ceiling fan and extractor fan in the kitchen
The apartments are equipped with Samsung flat screen TV’s. The choice of channels is not great but anyone who has a phone with Smart View or Mirror screen can watch their favourite streaming channel such as Netflix or YouTube. WiFi is provided for each apartment and is excellent

Although the reception is no longer staffed 24 hours the charming Manager (Nasmeer) can be contacted at any time. Daphne on who staffs reception during opening hours is very helpful. Security staff are there to deal with guests arriving or leaving outside of reception hours

An elevator/lift serves all floors. 

Outside, there is a good sized immaculately maintained swimming pool in a small secure garden fringed with palm trees and exotic plants. Direct access to the beach

Value for Money – Compared to tourist hotels in Negombo the rental price for the apartments is favourable especially taking in to account the spaciousness, the flexibility to self-cater and the front line Indian Ocean beach location.

X Factor – Located just a short distance away from the Negombo “strip” with its hub hub of restaurants, cafes, bars and souvenir shops the location is ideal. Anyone staying in Negombo for one or two nights may prefer to enjoy the facilities of a full service hotel. But for longer stays the flexibility to self-cater and to see and experience more of local life this venue is a great choice. In addition, the hard working staff are remarkable and go 100% and more to meet any requests guests may have. I cannot wait to return – and I don’t say that about many places!
During my stay in Sri Lanka I also made use of the services of Kulansa Tours who I have relied on in the past for airport transfers and island wide sightseeing on and off the usual tourist trail.

Since then, we read a few worrying reviews, but we decided to stick with our instincts, we're VERY glad we did!
We booked for 7 nights, it was almost the end of a 56 night trip, 28 around Sri Lanka. Prior to coming to Negombo, we had a great stay in Colombo, the plan (and booking), was to have our final 2 nights back in Colombo. However, almost immediately we arrived in Negombo, we decided to stay! 
The Beach Apartments were 99% responsible for this decision!
Location - easy walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, bars, coffee shop, laundry and shops!
Directly on the beach! Beach bars less than 2 minutes walk away and a lovely pool & pool area!
Ocean View!
Everything we want in a location!
The apartment itself, some reviews said it was dirty, we cannot agree with this at all! OK, it's a little tired. The outdoor pool beds need changing, the cushions are dirty, but, you're given big, fluffy towels that cover the cushions! 
We stayed in 203. We had an amazing view of the ocean! AC in bedroom & lounge worked so well, it was almost too cool at times!! Good fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, comfy sofa, TV that mirrors your Netflix, etc. Big balcony with table and chairs. We would take this apartment around the world with us. The value is outstanding! Housekeeping is available, free of charge, daily, including 2 bottles of water and refills of tea & coffee etc. We would have loved a coffee machine!!  There is also a private rooftop, you are encouraged to enjoy it, the views are lovely!
The staff, both housekeeping and reception, were amazing,  couldn't do enough for us!
If I were to make a negative comment, it would be the crows! OMG! so many crows! 
Out of all the areas we stayed in in Sri Lanka, Negombo was our favourite. We will return, and we will stay at The Beach Apartments.
Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!","Excellent!

The photos are from 2017. Where do I start, well in my humble opinion accommodation needs to fulfil some basics, namely cleanliness, service, maintenance, value for money. So let's look at this.
Cleanliness is frankly appalling, our room was cleaned only after we insisted on day 5 and then only again when we asked but no towel change on either occasion. We are sure the room was full of mosquitos as we are covered in bites. The bedroom had ants and a visiting lizard. It all needed a thorough clean. The pool toilets are a disgrace and if management have looked at them in the last 5 years they have done nothing and certainly not cleaned them there isn't even a door!
The pool loungers are filthy and literally have not been cleaned for a considerable time either plus there is not enough for the number of guests and they are very uncomfortable with only one position and no recline close to the worst I've ever sat on. 1/10
Service
The restaurant is closed as is the bar and if you want to talk to anyone you have to be quick as reception is not manned for any length of time. The small amount of staff there are helpful though.Difficult to score service when they are not present 1/10
Maintenance
The whole site has clearly had no maintenance or attention for several years even basic things. The reception toilet door lock is broken the pool toilets doesn't even have a door the communal areas are dirty flaking paint and dirt everywhere all in all very disappointed on what would have been a lovely spec previously but sadly those days are gone. 
Then there is the noise and bedrooms, we were on the back of the propert in a suite and the church rang it's bells every morning at 5am loudly enough and long enough to wake us every morning, they also broadcast their service over loudspeakers. The black out blinds don't black out anything and the locals use the side alley as a play area letting off fireworks at all hours when I say we got no sleep it was so bad we left and booked into another hotel after 5 days and when we came back guess what they still hadn't cleaned it.
Summary 
No sleep, dirty rooms, biten to death, rubbish loungers.","Alternate Reality","2024-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d6369291-r933998360-The_Beach_Apartments-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","0","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/548nicm","nicm","92F42F8FA1E510B69A3B9C69C0F74335",,,,,"548nicm"

We will make sure that we take action against such poor standards of rooms and apartments that are provided after they collect USD 400.
When we complain, they say that wait till 2.00 PM and that too with no assurance that the quality of the room will be up to the mark.

During that time i was spending my vacation with different destinations. Negombo was one of them. I’ve choosen the best hotel stay over there. It is THE BEACH ALL SUITES. At the first impression the staff were very courteous , active and helpful. 

The receptionist BERNEY did a very hard job while we arrive there. She was doing bellboy duty as well as the receptionist and Guests relation Officer.  Really appreciate her welcome and all the courtesy she had given to us. Though she looks very tired, she managed to give us the greatest service  she could give us at that time. Even her voice was soo much damaged cause she was taking care of too many guests that day. As we did a little chat with her we were able to get to know each other. 

We were checked in there late afternoon. the hotel was full and the staff also much tired. She was very friendly and within few minutes she gave us all the facilities and information of the hotel that we could facilitate during our stay. My wife was very impressed by her courtesy and her friendliness. Actually we were very tired of driving there from far, but once we went to the room it’s unbelievable. We’ve got the room as we expected. As we were three person the the housekeeping staff were manged to provide us an extra bed as well. Also once the housekeeping staff visited to the room my spouse has told him to check Air condition remote controller which had an issue, they’ve fixed it same time. They are very caring about the guests comfort. 

Unfortunately after checkout we had to face a car breakdown. But the hotel security staff immediately called one of the engineering person and sent him to take a wire for the battery charge. That time  the engineering person was doing one of his duties inside the lobby. Though he manged to bring a wire from outside and helped us, As quickly as possible. Meantime my wife was sitting at the lobby till the car got fixed, at that time also BERNEY have been very courteous to my spouse. We really enjoyed our stay with you. 

Highly recommended place for anyone who is looking for good surroundings , better service as well as helpful and courteous staff. 
Best of luck. 

Hope to stay with you again.

Some standout favourites included the starters featuring local mackerel, a flavourful soup, and a delicious kohila dip. The mains were equally impressive—the steak was cooked to perfection, and the cassava and coconut blend was a surprising highlight. It’s now our favourite alternative to mashed potatoes!

But my partner and I felt this place was truly an out of ordinary on several levels. I wanted to write this for others as I myself was unsure before booking it. But also as a reflection on an experience I won’t ever forget. 

We came to Sri Lanka because we wanted a luxurious break with some natural exploration and cultural exploration. My partner had been to India. I’ve spent time in Thailand and Indonesia for work and pleasure. I’ve stayed in seaside shacks I loved, airbnb and vrbo rooms and villas, boutique hotels and mandarin oriental /four seasons resorts in the past in my travels across the world. 

Arriving in Colombo - it’s worth paying for the expedited immigration- not at all necesssry but it was nice. We spent the night at a place near the airport as we arrived after midnight- cheap and cheerful and clean. We had arranged a driver for the whole trip (which is normal for Sri Lanka - they quote an all inclusive price including driver’s accomodation). A dedicated driver was the same price as airport hotel transfers and inter property transfers and gives you flexibility and a bit of a guide. Some drivers steer you towards places where they get commissions as is normal - so be aware. 

We took local roads to cape Weligama and with lunch it took us more than 6 hours - by highway it would have been half. And probably safer with less dodging tuk tuks, but also less colourful. 

The place is spectacular. I read before I booked to get a villa If you can afford it and I strongly agree. Again it isn’t critical but we loved the villas. And we had a premier one #37 which is closer to the center of things. It was beautifully designed - there is a good sense of privacy (although landscapers a s staff will sometimes walk around the shed but it didn’t feel bothersome). 

The bathroom is huge and gorgeous and luxurious. Pictures don’t do it justice. The steam shower was very nice. The towels and linens were commiserate with the environment. 

 Breakfast outside on our lanai/porch every day was magical. If you are in a villa it can be floating in your private pool or delivered. The fruit was particularly great. There were great squirrels around and one morning a mongoose as well as beautiful birds. It was idyllic. 

Overall the service was great and people seemed to geninuinely want to contribute to the experience and take pride in their environment. It has a relaxed atmosphere and not the Disneysque happiness at gunpoint feel. It is definitely not over programmed - while there are things to do and excursions - of you show up with a “here we are, entertain us” attitude, you may be disappointed. This is for people who want to connect with their environment and bathe in elegance and sophisticated design carved out of nature on the edge of the ocean. 

We particularly enjoyed the cooking class / some of the best food we had in Sri Lanka. It was great to see the extremely fresh ingredients and learn about the spices. We asked about a vegetable we had seen in a supermarket and presto it appeared - they take a lot of pride in their cuisine and ingredients. Aruna Kumara was the chef and he was ridiculously patient with us and we left feeling we could actually cook the dishes back home. Very highly recommend it. 

Also the spa was great - one of the best massages I’ve  had anywhere in the world was by Rina who was strong and anatomically focused/educated. It is usually one or the other if you are lucky. We went back a second time. The couples massage was also a great atmosphere and a centrepiece of our stay. 

Maga was the other massage therepist we encountered and she was lovely. She also runs yoga three days a week - perhaps my only constructive thought was that it would be nice to have yoga daily.one yoga session had the entertainment of monkeys cavorting in the trees. 

The restaurant is solid but it is also easy to eat out in the village - you could walk to local restaurants which looked good or quickly drive to beachside places where you pick your fish and they cook it. 

In addition to the pools shared by residences, there is a common moon pool with a breathtaking view and they will make you a coconut to drink :) pro tip - take it back and put it in your fridge. Cold they are on another level. 

Also you can walk down to the beach and swim in the Indian Ocean. There is also a bar there. The whole complex has pretty good wifi coverage. 

High tea was fine- not their strongest offering but it was fun to try the teas. Piuli (sp?) was a lovely and cheerful guide and introduced me to teas I would never have tried and now brought home.

We went on the local tea plantation tour. It was interesting. A little odd. Worth it to learn about tea and see cinamon being made. 

A note of recognition to Niswanathan (sp?) who I believe is the food and beverage manager and was accomodating and lovely when asked for help. 

Finally If it is in season - strongly recommend the maritime experience/whale watching cruise. It isn’t cheap - especially compared to local tours. But when we went out we understood why. It was fabulous. The crew is lovely. There was a very knowledgeable guide. The food was great. We were under sail a lot of the time. They are respectful toward the maritime life and a lot of local charters were awful - one of them almost rammed a Bryce’s whale rushing to get to it. 

Also - definitely recommend their sister property Wild Coast Tented lodge for two nights. But we love Cape Weligama so much we came back for an unexpected last night before we left Sri Lanka and it was the perfect ending to our trip.","An extraordinary experience.","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1004371366-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391968","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","1200","0","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriskH1754QD","Chris K","EF9E27ADACC4C3B0D29B77500704B898",,,,,"chriskH1754QD"

From our arrival and an upgrade from villa to luxury villa, every moment here was a dream! We were fortunate enough to be at a villa next to the moon pool with views of the sea. 
The Moon Pool is one of the most special places in the world. The photos do not really show the sheer size of the pool. With views over the surf it feels more like swimming in a warm clean lake. We even came swimming here in the rain! 
The breakfast was really something! (as with every breakfast in Sri Lanka). 
We chose a villa as we were on our honeymoon and the apartments / rooms overlooked the family pool. Being April however (on the shoulder season) the hotel was quiet and often we were the only people in the pool. 
The villa we stayed in was enormous. With a shared but private pool. We had no need as we were so close to the Moon Pool. 
The restaurant for dinner was great too - although def on the more expensive side. We tuk tuk into weligama and tried the increibdle RISE pizza one night and loved it. the hotel can arrange the Tuk Tuk so I wouldn't let the price of the restaurant hold you back its really easy to get out. 
We had fun with a few games of pool. The surf here at the new beach was a little rough for the swimming but if we had bothered the beaches on either side of the property looked pretty good for swimming. 
We can not wait to come back. A wonderful, honeymoon stay.","Perfection.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r1003879907-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbcktravel","Caz","F04C5642AB6E7528137BB08E931B44B2",,,,,"pbcktravel"

It was such a peaceful spot to spend time by the pool and beach after a busy few weeks of sightseeing, and felt like real luxury - particularly when every team member throughout the property was so wonderful and keen to make our stay extra special. They were especially careful with my severe gluten allergy, with the main chefs offering to make or adapt any dishes I wanted, which I really appreciated. Given this, we were a bit disappointed that we weren’t able to eat at Tableau restaurant as my husband doesn’t eat fish, and they couldn’t adapt one dish. However, it’s a beautiful hotel (our room was gorgeous!) with great facilities and we enjoyed our stay very much - we would definitely recommend it to others.

Rooms are enormous, even our junior suite (smallest alternative) was larger than any other hotel room we have ever stayed at. All thinkable amenities included, quite a generous minibar policy too, where everything in the minibar is free once.

Staff is friendly, attentive and professional. Food was extraordinarily good, with a huge variety of everything from local curries to cordon bleu - the chef's version of the latter was very delicious! 

But what really sets Cape Weligama apart from other options, is the property: it's like walking into an enormous tropical garden, with fruit trees, flowers, birds and butterflies everywhere. On the property we also saw komodo dragons, cameleons, bright blue kingfisher birds. The pretty moon pool overlooks the beautiful bays below the cape where the property lies, but our most terrific experience was just sitting outside the hotel in the afternoon, with some wine, seeing the sun go down, listening to the life in garden; suddenly two grey langurs (rather big monkeys) sat down on the roof above us, before they ran off into some other trees on the property. A peacock wandered by. Next thing, a wonderful moonlit dinner on the nearby terrace. Cape Weligama is very tranquil and relaxing, but also interesting and fun!

Rather pricy for Sri Lanka, we would still chose this hotel over any other, should we return to the island.","Great hotel in a tropical garden","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r999888520-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","82","62","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBro","Johan B","6844147990B5248AB73E4C5C396A797E",,"190479","Oslo, Norway","Oslo","JayBro"

It has been such a long time where a five star hotel acutally met my expectations and exceeded them- all without being pretentious! The Sri Lankan service was impeccable. 

Rooms- chefs kiss! Spacious, everything you need plus things you wouldn’t think you need. Steam shower was amazing. 

Facilities- brand new and fabulous. Pools amazing, as was service as the beach. 

Food/ drink- yes expensive by Sri Lankan standards but well worth it. Cocktails were some of the best I had, with very generous pours. Dinner was delicious!

Regarding the added taxes. I appreciate your concern. In Sri Lanka, hotels charge a 10% service charge which is distributed equally to all staff. There is also a value added tax of 18% levied by the government together with a 1% tax from the tourist board. This is how hotels in Sri Lanka in the formal sector operate. No doubt there are some informal establishments that may not comply fully with the law. 

If you had raised this question during your stay, I am sure the team would have explained it, potentially avoiding the need for a two-star review, which reflects poorly on the service team. 

I would be happy to clarify anything further if you would be good enough to inbox me.

Nestled in the forested hills north of Kandy you really do feel a part of nature, within 5 minutes of checking into our room we were watching birds, lizards and monkeys in the surrounding trees from our balcony. 
We stayed 5 nights in the Sky Tented room with its private infinity pool that had the most amazing view across the valley and forests.
The resort is lovely. It was smaller than I was expecting, but that gives it a personal and intermit feel. 
The staff couldn’t be more attentive and helpful. 
The dinning experiences were delightful and after informing the resort, when I booked, that both me and my husband had vegan dietary requirements the chef and staff met the challenge with enthusiasm and smiles and were able to serve us up delicious and interesting (veganised) local dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is very much appreciated as we know how this can be quite an effort.
The elephant excursion we booked through the resort was incredible, with an informative guide and great driver. It was also simple to book a car and driver at the resort to take us down to Kandy Royal Botanic Gardens, which was a surprisingly delightful way to spend a morning without having to travel too far. 
We were also taken on a nature walk through the resort’s garden where we were shown spices, fruit and the local abundant bird life. 
Our only regret was that we didn’t book more days there as we passed up a few of the other interesting excursions on offer so as we could spend some more relaxing time enjoying the resort and it’s tranquility.","Nature and luxury go hand in hand at Aarunya Nature Resort","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r969640033-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"481","276735340","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/7e/a5/6c/adiewall.jpg","481","0","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianaw46","Adriana W","2BACFF564114CA2312E5D4A09BE12F29",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","adrianaw46"

The best resort we have ever stayed in, perfect resort to relax & actually unwind. We took all inclusive package & Sky tented room with private pool overlooking a spectacular green valley. anddddd it was sooo much worth it. Their super excellent service spoiled us from the moment you reach the resort. We were welcomed with a spectacular view & super warm staff. Also given a welcome 10 minute massage.  In the package, all meals were included which had 5 course meals every time. The chef was great & food was so delicious every time. Every day 30 minutes massage was also free in the package which was the cherry on the cake to relax completely. The property itself was beautiful & had short in the jungle kind of walkways to explore. It was a perfect getaway & the staff made it extra comfortable for us with their service. It’s a boutique resort so has like 9-10 rooms only mostly all with private pools I think. So the staff gives you full attention & comfort, be it getting you food in your room or at their restaurant. They have one restaurant at the lobby & fixed 4-5 course meal menu but still with 2-3 option in every course. They have Ala carte options too. Kids might not feel much to do in this resort apart from pool or some games. Thankyou to the whole staff for make it a perfect & super excellent stay 7/ for a thoughtful parting gift.

Warm greetings from the sunny corridors of Aarunya!

We extend our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience experienced during your recent visit. Regrettably, a technical issue arose concerning your original booking, which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to fulfill. However, we swiftly arranged alternative accommodations of a similar standard and orchestrated a special dinner in acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused.

Upon receipt of your complaint, our dedicated team sprang into action, promptly involving local authorities to address the matter. In response, we bolstered security measures, stationing additional police guards and hotel security in the vicinity of your room to ensure your safety and peace of mind. Despite our earnest attempts to rectify the situation, we understand that you declined our offers, including alternative room arrangements and various amenities, for which we deeply regret.

In your statement, you indicated that staff members were implicated in the burglary. However, thorough police investigations, involving all on-duty staff present during the incident, found no evidence supporting this claim. Following the police inquiry, the hotel management issued a formal apology and extended a comprehensive offer of assistance to address the situation.

Please be assured that we are actively collaborating with law enforcement authorities, and updates regarding the ongoing investigation will be communicated to you as soon as they become available.

While this isolated incident is unprecedented in our history, we remain committed to the well-being and satisfaction of our guests. As a precautionary measure, we encourage all patrons to utilize the safety deposit boxes provided within each room to safeguard their valuables.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

Best Regards,

Upon our arrival, we were allocated the wrong room, which already raised concerns about the hotel's organisation and attention to detail. Little did we know that this rooms CCTV was  conveniently 'broken'.

When we were out for dinner our room was broken into and our valuables stolen. The sliding doors to our room were smashed in, leaving us not only devastated but feeling violated and unsafe. 

On request, the police were called and statements were taken. What is perhaps even more shocking than the burglary itself is the complete lack of accountability and compassion from the hotel staff. Despite reporting the incident immediately and expressing our distress, we were offered no apology or refund from the management.

It is abundantly clear to us that Aarunya played a significant role in the burglary (hotel IPAD was left in room), whether through negligence or complicity. The fact that they have not taken any responsibility for their failures speaks volumes about their priorities and ethics.

Upon speaking with locals, it's become clear, there has been previous reports of burglary at Aarunya and allegations of misconduct. If we had known this, we obviously would not had stayed. 

In conclusion, I urge everyone to steer clear of Aaarunya in Sri Lanka. Not only does it fail to provide even the most basic security measures for its guests, but its callous disregard for our well-being is utterly disgusting.","Burglary and Betrayal","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r948696281-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daisylister","Daisy L","78D93DC944A2803F39F03D0EB4B7868F",,,,,"Daisylister"

 The hotel also arranged a walking tour with Mr.Tharanga who was a great tour guide. I highly recommend him as he has great knowledge of history and Galle's heritage.

There is also a free guided tour/heritage walk of the fort with an expert archaeologist who has worked with planning permissions and renovating many of the buildings in recent years. It was a pleasure speaking with him and learning more about the unesco site. 

Sugath the head chef came to speak with me personally when I requested more local Sri Lankan cuisine and made me an exquisite bespoke lunch which was the absolute highlight of my trip. Avi and Lihini also went above and beyond to ensure we had our comforts met. Thank you all!

The staff were warm and welcoming and the old Dutch Colonial building is very beautiful. Light and airy, it has been decorated in very restful tones,  in a very  contemporary, comfortable style, with plenty of easy chairs and sofas to rest in. 

The hotel has 18 well appointed rooms, simply furnished but all furnishings are top notch and they have supplied everything you need.

As with anywhere, it is as much about the people who make the stay memorable and this is certainly the case here as the staff really do go over and above.

The pool area is only a year old, a clean and tranquil place with very comfortable beds and very attentive staff. I was very happy to spend time here reading and enjoying a book.

The food offered for breakfast was the best that we had had, unfortunately we didn't have an evening meal here but the complimentary afternoon tea with cake and biscuits and then the happy hour complimentary cocktails were a really generous bonus. 
There is a complimentary town tour offered by the hotel , which we would have taken up but had previously booked our own when we originally made the booking. 
Galle is a lovely town, particularly inside the Fort, with a facinating history and I would urge anyone staying to just take a littke time to learn about it. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend this place as a little Oasis of calm in a busy Sri Lankan town.

Most of the main shops, restaurants, and cafes - albeit geared for tourists - as opposed to being Sri Lankan, are so close by to this hotel. And the rest of the areas of interest in the Fort are all a slightly longer walk away - which is still not far, anyway. 
The layout of the hotel is well-designed. 18 rooms, all in 2 blocks. The rooms themselves are relatively spartan - with no carpets, and basic furnishings. The bed is comfortable. Essentially, the rooms are not really intended to stay-in for long periods except to sleep. My main frustration is the lack of space for storage of clothes - just a few hangars to hang clothes - so be prepared to live out of your suitcase. 
The pool area - albeit small - is quiet and a good escape
I recommend the Spa for a really good massage. Seems that there is only one staff, but she is excellent
The bar is lovely with good colonial feel. 
The restaurant has tables in and outside. The menu offers a range of international and a few Sri Lankan selections. This is the trend at Galle Fort. The patrons appear to be Western and market demand has resulted in relatively bland food to cater to tastes which are not accustomed to spicier Sri Lankan offerings. But Fort Bazaar’s Sri Lankan selection is probably better than the others, but still below the normal Sri Lankan flavours
The standout feature is that they have a few staff at Reception who play an excellent concierge role. One in particular is Lihini - she really makes that special effort to please
Ultimately, this is an average hotel which stands out due to their staff","A good choice for Galle Fort","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d9981243-r988390372-Fort_Bazaar-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","221","243","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siglo","Siglo","2AB4FCDD4F6BF222B2B08E96DCD7BAE8",,"298570","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","siglo"

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the elegant décor and thoughtful design that perfectly blends modern style with the charm of a historic setting.
 
We were warmly welcomed by Nafhan, who greeted us at the front and gave us a personal tour of the property, sharing insights and stories along the way. His hospitality and attention to detail were truly exceptional, setting the tone for our stay.
 
The rooms are beautifully styled, offering a perfect balance of comfort and sophistication. Every element, from the furnishings to the lighting, felt carefully considered. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the hotel’s long-awaited swimming pool, a brilliant addition that elevates the experience at Fort Bazaar. It’s the ideal spot to unwind after a day of exploring Galle Fort.
 
The level of service was outstanding. Every member of the staff went above and beyond to ensure we felt valued and comfortable. Their attentiveness and warm manner made us feel right at home.
 
We were pleasantly surprised by the happy hour from 5 pm to 6 pm, where guests are treated to tea, coffee, cocktails, mocktails, and fresh juices. This thoughtful gesture added a memorable touch to our experience.
 
Dining at the hotel’s restaurant was another highlight. The space strikes a perfect balance between grandeur and relaxation, creating a stylish yet chilled ambiance. The food was exceptional, with an excellent mix of local and international flavours. Our kids were thrilled with the selection of Western-inspired dishes, while we indulged in more Sri Lankan-inspired options. The quality and presentation of every dish were impeccable.
 
Fort Bazaar perfectly embodies the spirit of historical Ceylon blended with contemporary island luxury, just as you’d expect from Teardrop Hotels. It was an unforgettable stay, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone visiting Galle Fort.

Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night so didn’t get to use the facilities. The only negative was that we arrived around 2 and they didn’t want is to check i while 3. We were rushing back out to do a safari so this was really inconvenient. 3pm is a late check in. Also lije a lot of the hotels they seem to be taking advantage with the drink prices, 5500 lkr for 4 beers then they add on another 2000 lkr in tax and service charge. The bar was completely empty!

Whether you’re seeking a tranquil, laid-back escape or a more lively and engaging holiday, this place offers the perfect balance of both. The views of the lake at sunrise and sunset are truly breathtaking—mesmerizing in every sense.

The rooms are of exceptional quality and come equipped with everything one could possibly need. There’s an abundance of leisurely activities available, and we thoroughly enjoyed each one. You'll never be bored- there's a pool table, karaoke rooms, rooftop bars, cycling etc. Extra fact, the pool water here is magical—unlike most pools that tend to dry out your hair, this one somehow made mine unbelievably soft?? I was genuinely stunned.

The staff were absolutely delightful—so warm, welcoming, and ever-ready to assist. A special shoutout to Imesh, whose vibrant energy made our dining experience all the more enjoyable. We were also lucky enough to partake in the Awurudu celebrations, which captured the spirit of the New Year perfectly. It was a joy to be part of it.

Without question, we’ll be returning. An unforgettable experience.

Our traveling group will long remember our stay. The only downside is that we didn’t get an opportunity to experience the hotel and its surroundings in their entirety due to our time constraints. Next time, we will ensure a few nights' stay at this amazing hotel.

From the architectural design perspective of the hotel, including the beautiful rooms, to the warmth, attention to detail, and hospitality extended to our entire group by all of the staff, we had a fabulous experience. My expectations were far exceeded.

One of our touring group has an autoimmune disease that requires a special Gluten Free diet, which is hard to cater to whilst traveling across various regions.

However, we had contacted the hotel in advance about these requirements - which I think is the right approach, rather than just “turning up” and hoping for the best - and from the moment of our arrival right up until our departure, the duty of care shown by the management and catering department was faultless. Not to mention the wide array of dining options delivered to our table at dinner and breakfast. None of the food was an afterthought. And we know it's a lot of work for a busy kitchen to undertake. They could have taken some easy options when catering for a GF diet. But it was not the case here and the variety provided was fantastic.

I want to thank the manager Dayan, Allawatte the Chef. Chamindu, who ran a great restaurant and service, and Asanthi at the front desk for all their assistance. To the rest of the staff, from Turnstone (Lounge/Bar) to those managing the pool, thank you.

In our experience, everyone at DoubleTree is clearly doing something right. Keep up the great work. We look forward to visiting again.","Brilliant location and hotel and superlative service!","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1002851416-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DIN_EDW","DIN ED","88D2A063ACE03C044CFEA4210E44D9CC",,,,,"DIN_EDW"

But I cannot figure out why there isn't a single room with a view of the lake. All 78 rooms were advertised with garden view. That was a joke too. Please see the ""view"" from our balcony in the attached photo. The lake was visible only from the second floor (roof-top, no rooms) and from one side of the main restaurant.

Rooms on the first floor were better than the rooms on the ground floor faced a bit of garden with a wall at the edge.

The layout was another problem. Once you exit the room, you have to go round and round a long corridor (covered with creeping vines) to reach the reception area and the main restaurant. More direct access points either by elevator or stairs should have been planned. 

The rooms were comfortable, except for the view! Strangely there wasn't a single shirt-hanger. I guess we should have asked for them, but then isn't it Housekeeping's function to check all rooms prior to letting the guests in?

The Reservation made a mess of our booking. We asked for one room with twin beds, they had prepared both rooms with twin beds. The one who shared my room is a Hilton Honors member. When that was mentioned at the time of check-in they have made me too a Honors member.","A Waste of Scenic Property","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1001036948-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"756","149515640","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/e9/6d/78/max-j.jpg","756","70","373","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809maxj","Max J","B142CC475F5BE5DD84171058450145CA",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","809maxj"

The rooms are both spacious and extremely well appointed. All the fixtures and fitting are of quality. The bathroom offers two shower options, one at each end, a traditional rain/ordinary shower or a waterfall shower at the other end. The toiletries were the best we experienced in Sri Lanka.
The restaurant, buffet style was good for both dinner and breakfast offering a really large choice in both meals.
The pool, over the lawn from our room looked really good but we just did not have enough time to enjoy it.
Our room was quite a walk from the reception and restaurant as this is a big and spacious hotel, set in lovely gardens.
It was a pity to have only stayed one day and we would both have loved to spend another couple of days there.","Quality hotel from the first to the last moments","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1000901812-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391968","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg","1200","56","153","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanS7","Jan S","D7255DF2D6F1A99D512EE774F7237943",,"186281","Cotswolds, United Kingdom","Cotswolds","JanS7"

Lots of insect repellent. Bring games and books to entertain your children in your room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pros: Beautiful tranquil large hotel set next to a stunning lake with the largest pool we have seen in Sri Lanka so far. Welcome bedding and cake set out for our wedding anniversary. Staff friendly and helpful although information overload at check in with no further information in the room to double check what you had been told.
Room spacious, nicely designed, balcony of the lake view and pool non existent. Instead a huge tree and the sound of people enjoying the pool. Excellent buffet breakfast. Great location to visit Yala National Park. 

Cons: Our room had an ant and cobweb problem, initially in the bathroom. The ant situation worsened when the rains came. The balcony was covered in white crystal larvae that opened up overnight and turned into brown lumps of seeping mess. The balcony definately belonged to nature, more ants, cockroaches, baby toads.  

We were out on excursions during the day returning early afternoon when the rains came. The pool was the only entertainment for our 12 year old and this was shut in the afternoon/early evenings due to the adverse weather conditions. Sadly we never had the opportunity to swim in what was a stunning pool. With the outdoor bars and pool closed there was one bar option left (tunnel bar) with no atmosphere, music or other guests present. My daughter was somewhat bored as were we. There were no entertainment or provisions put in place for children or teenagers when the pool closed. Finally the distance of our room to reception and amenities was a good 10-12 minute walk, we felt isolated and perhaps had we been closer to the reception area we might have found more things to do to entertain ourselves. The complex is big so we didn’t befriend members of staff like in previous hotels.

This hotel is not for us, it lacked vibrancy, music, entertainment and the facilities to entertain yourself when everything else is closed. This hotel is a quiet retreat. I wouldn’t recommend bringing children in the rainy season.","Disappointing","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12336477-d14216084-r1000207797-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Weerawila_Rajawarna_Resort-Weerawila_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3813FRkarenj","Karen J","0E09DE25B40C21A174F98B3C35656610",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","H3813FRkarenj"

A few minor quibbles. Firstly, we were so far from town so had no other option but to eat in - and the cost of food and drinks really added up. Also - and I know this seems odd - the forks. I thought I was having a stroke as I struggled to hold the bloody fork!   I waited until everyone else at our table started to eat and they all had the same issue. Style over practicality!

On the rooftop is an ala carte restaurant and bar wonderful for star gazing. There is of course a gym and spa, tea experience room, children's playground. Probably other things we did not discover. The rooms are spacious, all facing the lake. Very large bathroom with 2 full sized showers. The breakfast and half board meals served in a large airey room with modern sculpture. Extensive choice of food, all buffet style.

This lack of transparency and misleading room allocation feels like a clear case of dishonest conduct and unfair treatment of guests. Such behavior raises serious concerns about the resort’s ethics and customer service.

Our room was ground floor, large and comfortable. Good shower. Tea and coffee, hairdryer, safe, some toiletries. We had our own mini pool at the back, which we didn't really use as surrounded by high walls and not very pretty. We did also have a terrace out front and could see the pool and the beach beyond. The food was similar to all the hotels we have stayed in, but there were a few more options if you wanted to avoid curry! The high score is because the hotel is right on the beach and on our last night, there was a disco, on the beach. We all danced and drank and sang. Then, there were fireworks on the beach and to cap it all, a Turtle came to lay eggs right in front of us. During the day, we saw an injured Turtle, attacked by dogs and the hotel had made sure it was treated. The hotel also takes the Turtle eggs from the beach, to stop the other animals digging them up. If the eggs hatch, they let the guests watch and help to release them safely into the sea. Fantastic effort to help these beautiful animals by the hotel. We sadly didn't see any hatched. Overall, our stay here was great. Walked along the beach at low tide, large bay, surfers and fisherman along the way. Some dogs on the beach and some pigs! Yes, we saw pigs cooling off in the sea. Really enjoyed our tour of Sri Lanka and this was a great finish. My only negative comment would be that the loud music on the beach went on far too late (still going at 11.30pm). Perhaps consider stopping at 11pm so guests can get some sleep!!

Adding insult to injury we were allocated the cheaper Lagoon view rooms. 
These were not communicated at all time even up to the point of check in. We found out when the travel agent asked if we were allocated the Seaview rooms as we have booked.
A rather stout man that appears to be the manager nonchalantly offered us a compensation in form of “small form”. No apologies were offered.
This lack of transparency and honesty raises doubts on the integrity and ethics of hotel management. It gives us the impression this was a standard management practise of allocating cheaper room for premium price ones. 
It is disappointing that Mandara resort to to this. Please make sure you get confirmation of your type of room in writing and ensure when you check in you get the right room. Ensure you have time to change alternative accommodation.

Ze doen echt alles om het je naar de zin te maken. Ze werken zich uit de naad. Lekkere cocktails, heel betaalbaar. Het eten was prima, maar we vonden het restaurant niet zo sfeervol, daarom gingen we liever buiten zitten. Dat was rustig en gezellig, met het ruisen van de zee als achtergrondmuziek. Leuk gepraat met de chef van de toetjes. Hij vertelde over de schildpadden die eieren hadden gelegd en dat daar bewaking voor nodig was. Mirissa vonden we een leuk stadje om rond te kijken.","Beautiful place right on the beach","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d1307887-r994426432-Mandara_Resort-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390984","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593eefjev","Eefje v","379DE635772733B1C70A21E31F6C0F74",,,,,"593eefjev"

It's possible that for the first couple of weeks, a freshly painted smell may have lingered - we've not had any similar feedback. 

We've now switched the WhatsApp system to a dedicated service center and response times are quick. My apologies that it wasn't implemented during your stay. 

Cape Weligama has just 39 villas and suites spread over 12 tropical acres. Whilst the local area it’s quite “happening”, the resort itself is more about serenity and a lovely location.

The speed of service in the restaurant was also admittedly slow for the first couple of weeks but that was resolved. 

Regarding the airport transfer, for sure Uber will be cheaper -- a hotel vehicle and the chauffeur for the two-hour journey would generally be more expensive than Uber as the level of service and amenities would be different.

I have to say the staff are lovely and very polite and helpful, but that’s the only real positive thing I can say.

The room I had booked had a damp and musky smell and felt incredibly dated. It was right next to the main road and there was loud music pumping so I asked to move rooms which they did. They moved me to a lovely room with a pool and while it was very nice, again there was just a strange smell in it.

While the resort is pretty, there doesn’t seem to be any ambience or atmosphere at all. 

They asked for my number on arrival so they can communicate by WhatsApp, they got my number wrong and when this was corrected, they still didn’t WhatsApp me. One night what I was waiting for a buggy, it didn’t show up and I was waiting for 15 minutes.

WiFi at the resort isn’t great outside of your room. It doesn’t work at the main pool.

The gym is good but again, just an odd smell there.

The service for all meals was incredibly slow, expect to wait at least 25-40 minutes and the food just isn’t worth the price. It’s very expensive and the quality isn’t worth what you get.

As I said, the staff are lovely, but when I come back to Sri Lanka I definitely won’t be staying here again.

They also quoted me $265 for a taxi to the airport when I was leaving and you can literally get one on uber for under $80.","Not worth the stay","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r994142701-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"50","193152709","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/83/46/c5/jemma-m.jpg","50","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/963jemm","Jemm","B2D602ECF3A7A59E9E42B6B2FD10719B",,,,,"963jemm"

The Cliff Edge moon pool - stunning location and views. The staff at the Cocoon Bar were super friendly and always looking out to offer us a cool drink

Restaurant - the staff were flawless. The Executive Chef came out the first night to say hello and to discuss any requirements and subsequently arranged the most delicious Sri Lankan meal. Each meal was delicious and beautifully presented.

The Spa and Ali - I visited three times during my stay for various treatments including the 90 minute Ceylonese massage which was heaven. Ali was brilliant. The spa could do with a steam room and sauna to complete the overall experience.

The Front of House staff - for the warm welcome and personal farewell, assisting with our transfers and also day trip requirements. Plus a special gesture ( and much appreciated one) offering us a late check out to prepare for a late flight out of Colombo

The thoughtful gardener - he saw how delighted I was to have a peacock on our balcony.

Cape Weligama was our last big stop in the country. We were here for 3 nights and 4 days.

Coming from Ceylon tea trails and Anantara (more similar to Cape weligama) - we had the same level of expectations when it came to the level of service and room amenities.

Initially when we were shown our premier villa we were blown away by the view, outdoor living area, spaciousness, cake and Prosecco upon arrival - first impressions were overall very good. 

However we noticed some shortcomings to do with the room and general service (although staff are lovely and sweet) they weren’t as attentive compared to the other locations. 

We shared our honest feedback with the hotel and they have blown us away by how they have treated our concerns. 

On the second to last day Monty (GM) himself went out of his way along with his staff to ensure my husband and I would end up having a memorable and beautiful stay with Cape Weligama. They have really taken on board our feedback and have completely changed our minds about the place. They were able to move us to an even better room, offered us a complimentary evening dinner and met all our needs. 

Needless to say, after this will be back to stay at Cape Weligama.

Our 25 yrs son spoke highly of his experience during his backpacker/surfer visits to Sri Lanka, but we were looking for a higher level of comfort.
Cape Weligama is a member of the Relais and Chateaux hotel association. We have a friend amongst the management team at R&C whose advice I sought prior to our decision to book. I personally don’t enjoy Indian spices although my wife loves curry, hence the combination of western and local cooking at the resort was important. The resort scored perfectly well in that respect, overall, the food offering is very good.
We had booked a King bedded Master Suite and were allocated one in the eastern beach side of the property at ground floor level overlooking the “family” swimming pool in the “Arthur C Clarke” building of 4 suites.  The villa blocks are named after reputed writers, personalities, or navigators, coincidentally my wife’s maiden name is “Clarke”. We were a little disappointed with the view from our ground floor suite, the upper-level suites have more light, especially on the west side of the resort (closer to the adults-only halfmoon shape pool). During the first 24 hours there seemed an absence of senior management presence at the resort, but this significantly changed on our second day when having expressed our disappointment, the assistant Executive Director Mr da Silva met with us and expressed his objective was to ensure our full satisfaction. Since then we received an outstanding level of personal attention to our needs thought our stay.
Two days prior to departure, we received a complimentary upgrade to one of the higher elevation villas – this was very appreciated and offered spectacular sunset and ocean views with an abundance of wildlife proximity. Should we return, this would be the sector of the property that we would prefer.
The rooms are well constructed with good quality furnishings. Not quite the latest technology seen in more modern luxury hotels, but the internet connectivity was excellent, and everything works. The rooms resemble the earlier Aman properties we stayed in such as Amanpulo in Philippines.
There is direct access to a small beach where the hotel has a rustic bar with limited drinks. We sensed that this area could be improved with more extensive cocktails and smartened up.
As a guest you are assigned a “curator” or butler who’s role is as an individual concierge and point of contact with the hotel. Our curator “the Brilliant Brenden” was very attentive, and instantly responsive on WhatsApp, not only helping whist in the resort, but also being on hand and contactable during our off-property excursions.
Another star performer in their team was Mr Senith, the restaurant manager. Each day we would discuss our bespoke menu, and which place and time we would like to eat. These intimate dinners were a big plus to us offering variety and complete segregation when we wanted it, or mixed dining with other guests when we preferred. The Chef’s “Tableau” by example was a fun evening very well done, as was snapper fish cooked to our own recipe with roasted fennel and hollandaise sauce, as well as curry for my wife!
Activities included a marine biodiversity experience on a catamaran. This requires a 6am hotel departure. We do find nature and marine life interesting, and we encountered multiple dolphin pods, sadly we didn’t get to see a Blue Whale. The experience which included a swim and lunch at anchor near the port was not ideal, the sea was not particularly clean and visibility was impaired for snorkelling. Although we are boating enthusiasts, this would not be an adventure we would repeat.
Cape Weligama now has a dedicated naturalist, Mr Damitha who is very knowledgeable and added further engagement for us in the environment. Damitha is a recent addition to the team and should be encouraged to develop a broader range of nature activities. The property is home to numerous wild species. Complimenting the families of roaming Peacock we saw Indian palm chipmunk, monkeys, iguana, lots of beautiful birds and a quite rare civet.
The resort offers a range of spa treatments and massages that were professionally delivered. My afternoon Balinese massage performed by therapist Mega was a daily treat! However, the spa building does lack a relaxation area or any steam room/sauna plunge pool facilities which would be a welcome improvement.
Incidentally, prior to arriving in Sri Lanka I discovered that the production and sale of cigars is prohibited anywhere in Sri Lanka. This is a negative to be aware of; cigar smokers should travel with adequate stock for the duration of stay.  Thankfully, I stocked up at our previous destination and enjoyed my Habana cigar most evenings after intimate dinner with a welcome cognac or scotch whisky over a game of chess. Some political lobbying from the tourist department about cigars might be an initiative to create a useful concession in the rule.
This review is written from a global travel context using global not local comparisons. Overall Cape Weligama provided great personalised service and comfort throughout the eight days of our visit and is likely to be a destination of excellence by Sri Lankan standards. I would highly recommend it as a luxury destination for a global luxury traveller.","Luxury on Sri Lanka’s south coast","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r989773403-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"225","74474694","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/70/64/c6/flyingwineman.jpg","150","65","98","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyingWineman","FlyingWineman","F8E867DAB01D51C9A04176954ED83914",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","FlyingWineman"

Positives:

Beautiful location and Spectacular views.
Had Some of the best laid out rooms of our Srilanka tour
Had Some of the best food we had in our Srilanka tour.

Good access to the South region including the charming town of Galle.

We enjoyed our time here.

Negatives:

Service Level was not in line with expectations for an ultra lux resort.  Customization, be it tours or meals, was accommodated but after making it feel that you were being granted a ""favor"" , rather than a welcome and natural accommodation of the requests.

Staff communication was not as expected.    Hotel Senior Management was not at all visible, in contrast to all the other hotels we stayed at in our Sri Lanka tour.

The biggest negative is the value and quality of the ""experiences"" offered.  In my opinion massively overpriced in relation to what is provided

The beach is tiny. If you are looking for beach access it may be better to stay somewhere else (maybe the nearby Marriott).

All in all, this is a good hotel that could do a lot better by raising its service level and providing better value.","Nice Stay at the Cape Weligama","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r987900505-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","17","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samerandfamily","Samer A","1FC921513E76AF8DFF010F9F8A0E3FC5",,"293997","Manama, Bahrain","Manama","Samerandfamily"

However, this place didn't measure up to those properties for numerous reasons.  Unlike those hotels' incomparably elegant style and thoughtful amenities, this comes off as a generic luxury hotel with large but average-looking rooms (no art on the walls, no stylish touches).  Our room was at the edge of the sprawling property (room 52, avoid) and had a strange and unpleasant smell, which staff tried to cover by spraying with a room deodorising spray, with only fleeting success.  There were several problems with the plumbing, including a toilet that wouldn't flush properly and broken steam shower.  The night of our arrival we waited 15 minutes to be seated at the restaurant, even though they do not take bookings; we also waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  The family pool had no swim toys to offer besides a ripped, half-deflated football.  The moon pool (which we only discovered the last day of our stay) was wonderful, but children are not welcome there.  The location and views are amazing, and these flaws might be forgivable in a mid-priced hotel, but the astronomical price of our stay combined with the hotel's deficiencies in comparison to the other Resplendent Ceylon properties, plus the fact that Welligama itself has a ton of other more convenient options, makes this hotel feel like a bad bargain all around.","Astronomical price for average rooms and poor amenities","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r987616624-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DumplingDare","DeStenWel","F9D3FE35DC914901442AA3E963987678",,,,,"DumplingDare"

We recommend you call ahead and specifically clarify the ocean view if that’s important to you!

Food : Breakfast was excellent. Dinner options for seafood were limited. I had local seafood platter which was great.

Rooms/ villas
Clean and well kept, but substantially below the standards for a high end resort. 

Out toilet was not flushing and hot water system was not working. This caused great inconvenience for us on the first day. When we complained maintanece staff came to fix it, but they could not. 
Then they offered us another villa, and said it would be ready by 2.30pm, and advised us to pack and be ready. But it wasn’t ready until 530pm. 

Staff- 
Good and friendly. But they looked tired and exhausted. 

Front-desk staff- 
Mahendra was great and helpful but Govinda needs bit more training in customer service. 

Location
Excellent and unique

Beach 
Have access to 2 public beaches, small walk, west beach was very rough, but the south beach was great, and about 300m walk from that point another excellent surf beach, all accessible.

This was not my first visit, and every time I return, I’m reminded why I choose this property — the exceptional service and genuine hospitality that goes above and beyond expectations.

From the front desk and concierge to the room service and Flow restaurant staff, the level of professionalism, courtesy, and care is truly world-class. Every interaction I had during my stay was with someone who was not just doing a job, but clearly committed to creating a memorable experience for guests.

The staff at all levels are courteous, helpful, and pleasant — real ambassadors of Hilton’s service excellence. Their dedication to guest satisfaction is evident in every detail, and they truly uphold the highest standards that the Hilton brand is known for. Without a doubt, the people here are Hilton Colombo Residences’ greatest asset.

I would like to take a moment to personally acknowledge a few team members who stood out during this stay: Vinya, Jinanjali, Manodya, Tharaka, Travene, Dasantha, Denuvan, Chanthula — and especially Chef Rohan, whose warmth and culinary expertise added a special touch to my experience. There are certainly many more who contributed to making my stay exceptional — these are just the names I happened to catch.

To the entire team at Hilton Colombo Residences: thank you once again for a fantastic stay.

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at Hilton Colombo Residence. We truly appreciate your comments and apologize for the inconvenience you faced during your time with us.

We understand that the issues you experienced with the air conditioning in your room were extremely uncomfortable and frustrating. You were initially checked into Room but as per your request, we did a room move, which faced the Lotus Tower. At 7:20 AM, we received your report about the air conditioning not working, and our engineer, attended to the issue. However, we understand that you were still facing discomfort, and we sincerely apologize for the delay in resolving this matter.

When you sent a message via KIPSU, we were immediately made aware of the situation, and we regret that you did not feel comfortable reaching out earlier. I can assure you that we take these matters seriously, and upon your request, we promptly arranged for a room change.

We apologize for the lack of communication and the inconvenience this caused. It is certainly not the level of service we strive to provide, and we will be reviewing our processes to ensure that any issues with room conditions are addressed promptly and efficiently in the future.

On a positive note, we’re happy to hear that you had a good experience at our main restaurant. We value your feedback and will continue working to improve all aspects of your experience with us.

Once again, we apologize for the discomfort and disruption you faced during your stay. We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and provide you with the exceptional service and comfort you expect from Hilton.

Since the rooms were so uncomfortable, we decided to leave and returned after 1 PM, only to find that the air conditioning still wasn't repaired. They asked for an additional two hours to fix it, without offering any apologies, and expected us to stay in the hot rooms. 

We had to repeatedly request to be moved to another room, as we couldn't bear to stay in those conditions any longer. We had already spent one night without air conditioning.

We appreciate your patience and will be reviewing our processes to ensure more efficient service at all times. We do offer a wide variety of breakfast items, and if you have any specific preferences or dietary needs, please feel free to inform our chefs.

We take great pride in providing a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and it’s fantastic to know that our efforts resonated with you.

As a Diamond member, this remains my top choice for accommodation. During my recent stay, Sabarishna from housekeeping went above and beyond—his service was outstanding. Additionally, many other staff members have consistently delivered top-notch hospitality, making each stay truly enjoyable.

However, the security staff remains a major disappointment. Despite my previous complaints, their service standards are well below expectations. I have never encountered such arrogance at a Hilton property. Today, I once again had to report an incident to the front office after being obstructed on my way to my room while using the digital key. Their attitude and lack of professionalism are unacceptable and do not align with the otherwise excellent service provided by the rest of the team.

Overall, while the hospitality from most of the staff is impeccable, the experience is tarnished by the unprofessional behavior of the security personnel. I sincerely hope management takes immediate action to address this issue.","Exceptional Service from Staff, But Security Needs Urgent Improvement.","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d300682-r994464755-Hilton_Colombo_Residences-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"720","700506081","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/c0/df/e1/caption.jpg","720","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592janakad","Janaka Wi","1A2F70A9E5BA46B99C434D6F24E4BC97",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","592janakad"

As a diamond member, I can attest to everything that you offered being outstanding. Your newly renovated rooms are gorgeous and state-of-the-art, the breakfast you offer is excellent, the cleanliness of the rooms and building is outstanding and your staff is friendly and welcoming. I was welcomed with treats, flowers, chocolates. You made me feel at home, very far from my home. A stay in a hotel is as good as the staff that greets you daily in the different areas of your business. Therefore, I would like to take the time to recognize a few of your amazing staff that went above and beyond ensuring my stay was a memorable experience. Zainab in guest relations was excellent, knowledgeable, and responsive. She ensured my check in went smoothly and accompanied me herself to ensure the room was perfect. Your housekeeping team is one of the best I have met in my many stays across the world. I would like to recognize two of your housekeeping staff Avintha and the Housekeeping Executive Menaka. Finally, the most important staff that is the reason I returned to this hotel, Lanka, concierge. He is the reason I stayed in this hotel. He is the most knowledgeable, accommodating, responsive and professional Hilton staff I have ever met. From before arrival, he was there ensuring taxis were booked, checking on my stay and flights, just beyond outstanding. Lanka even ensured I had a breakfast to go when I had an early flight departure. Thank you again to all of your staff, your security and elevator staff. Everyone I interacted with was great. Special thanks to Zainab, Avintha, Menaka, and most especially, Lanka. I will come back and recommend this hotel to colleagues and friends.

From the moment we arrived, the reception staff were friendly and helpful and check in was quick and easy. The bed was supremely comfortable and the room (1613) was well equipped. A great plus is access to Prime tv! 
Breakfast was fabulous with a huge choice of tasty, well prepared foods with some areas overlooking the Lotus pool complete with koi and black swans. A joy to watch at such close quarters!
The pool, loungers and spacious terrace (SunsetBlu) were perfect. The water was just the right temperature and the towels provided were large and fluffy.
The executive lounge is large, well laid out and the evening snacks/canapés/drinks plentiful and varied.
Everywhere in the hotel is clean and well cared for and the gardens are beautifully maintained.

But without doubt, what made this hotel stand out was the staff. Without exception, they are full of smiles, are polite, friendly and helpful and go the extra mile unprompted. Service everywhere was exceptional but special mention must go to Lucky and staff (at SunsetBlu) and Krishenthra and his team in the exec lounge.

This is such a hotel.

Genuine similes and faultless service throughout. Attached is a selection of the fabulous staff that await to greet you at this gem of a hotel.

The journey out

After a pleasant  enough trip over the ocean from the UK to CMB via Abu Dhabi, we were eager to hop into our Uber ride over to the Hilton Colombo.

Top tip

Get your currency at the ATMs or foreign exchanges booths immediately after passport control.

In order to keep in contact  or to simply navigate your way around Sri Lanka either purchase an Esim before you leave the UK or get a tourist Sim card from the Dialog mobile phone desk located in the arrivals area.

Transportation

Uber works well here and they are safe and reliable (the taxi pickup point is via the S2 doorway exit – it’s well signposted). If using a local taxi, try to get a metered one and/or agree the price first. The journey from the airport to central Colombo was around 45 mins.

Arrival & Check-in

On arrival at the Hilton, we were met by Lakshitha the smilingly bellman, who quickly whisked our bags away. It was a great first impression of things to during our extended stay.

The building from the outside is pretty impressive with well manicured lawns, but as you enter the central atrium, there is a wow factor due to the sheer amount of space, it’s airy and well decorated with a modern contemporary finish and was always spotlessly clean during our stay.

Big bright spaces tastefully designed with areas to sit and work or to relax in. We were impressed by the clever lighting and lovely tones of dark in the recessed ceiling. The fresh daily flower displays throughout the hotel were also a nice touch.

Check-in was smooth and welcoming with many staff members on hand to help. Naleesha and her team members explained where everything was and how everything worked. They were both professional and personable, offering a welcome drink to guests which I thought was a great touch.   

To our surprise, they also upgraded us to an executive room to use during our stay which was very welcomed and unexpected.  This was lovely and personal touch that made us feel genuinely valued as HH diamond members and excited about our stay.

The exec room blended modern luxury and classic elegance. The room had a lovely ambient and comforting decor. It felt light and spacious. The room also had a super quite noise free air conditioning system, ideal for getting a great night’s sleep. The bed was super comfortable with a choice of pillows and high-quality white linen – just what was needed after a long  journey.  The view from the room of the sunset over the Galle Face Beach was wonderful to watch each evening.

The hotel has just completed a major refurbishment where they renovated all rooms and it shows. There were lots of sockets with USB ports, as well as UK type 3 pin ones by the bed which were handy for multiple device charging.

A top tip for this hotel is to request to be on the seaview side (as these have the best views).

The hotels location works perfectly for us as its a great place from which to explore Colombo. It is also easy to access most other areas of the city including Galle Face Beach and the Lotus Tower. If you are a walker, you’ll be fine without taxis/ tuk-tuks for the most part. 

There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the surrounding areas as well as boutique shops and markets particularly at the nearby Galle Face Mall. It’s a very safe city to explore, locals are only to pleased to help and English is widely spoken.

Tip 

In addition to the high end shops located at Galle Mall, on the lower floor there is a variety of eateries and it’s also the nearest branch of Keells supermarket if you need to purchase any snacks or last minute toiletries.

Another one of the big pluses for staying at this hotel is its very close to Colombo Fort railway station for those who wish extend their stay by travelling inland to the likes of Kandy, Ella or beyond. 

Tip 

Book your train tickets online via Sri Lanka railways website and save the e-ticket to your phone, it’s more convenient that queuing in person at the railway booking office.  FYI book early particularly for the train to Ella as it can get really busy especially at the weekends. Also at most stations, its cash only payment.

Restaurants and dining 

The hotel has a number of restaurants and bars with a variety of cuisines and styles including ‘Graze’, ‘LAB’,  ‘SunsetBlu’ and ‘Emperor’s Wok’ to name a few.

 Breakfast is served in ‘Graze’ which has a very comfortable seating area and a very extensive and impressive buffet selection spanning Vegan, Asian, European, Indian and local dishes plus cooked to order foods, such as poached eggs and omelettes or whatever took your fancy.

The breakfast was excellent, it was always very tasty, plentiful with warm and attentive service to boot (particularly shout out to the restaurant manager Ms Sajee, young Oshadha and Fonia who greeted us daily with big beaming smiles). It made a great start to each day.

Everything we ate was delicious, so much so we often had to resist temptation to have a second breakfast each.

If you want to maximise  your lazy time whilst having breakfast, lunch or dinner, ask to be seated in the outdoor area at Graze overlooking the lotus themed lake watching the koi carp and black swans, its a great setting to munch on a croissant and have a cup of tea or spot of afternoon brunch.

The hotel has a reputation for its food, and it could be for that reason that it was noticeably busier at the weekends. From looking at the LAB menu they have a lot of great looking choices including afternoon tea and extensive range of drinks at reasonable prices too.

Pool Area

Service and facilities at the pool area were consistently solid as you’d expect at a 5 star hotel, with comfy sun loungers, water and towels, plus a range of delicious food and snacks available at the  pool-side. Service was attentive and responsive with that same welcoming smile that greeted us upon arrival (talking about you Roshan, Haren and Lucky, thanks guys). The hotel also has a modern gym space with a plenty of cardio machines, enough to have a good workout if that’s your thing. The hotel also has a spa but we did not visit may be on our next visit.

Executive Lounge

This is one area that this  exemplified the very, very best of the Hilton brand. Yes some Hiltons have lounges, but this one puts most to shame (talking especially to you Hilton UK). The ambiance of the lounge is particularly top notch with a warm welcoming vibe. The team consisting of Sachite, Manisha, Dinujain, Sithusadi and Kawmini are fantastic, customer focused and great brand ambassadors for the hotel.

The lounge is expertly overseen by Kirishnantha the manager who ensures that everything is always on point. He has a great manner about him such as greeting each guest by name and ensuring their lounge experience is an outstanding one. 

The lounge is situated on the 2nd floor with great views of the garden and the lotus themed lake. It had a large dining area together with a range of cozy and comfy informal seating areas.

The lounge is open for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. In the day time it’s mainly tea, soft drinks and yummy cookies and cake; as well as providing a great space in which to unwind and watch the world go by.

Its in the evening where the lounge shines brightly with its complimentary buffet and drinks offer 18.00 - 20.00 hrs. This included a variety of tasty cold and hot snacks including meat, fish and pasta dishes, sandwiches, sushi, soups, salads, cheese and biscuits, fruit and desserts. The food offer changes on a daily basis reflecting different international cuisines.

The food is fresh, very scrumptious and more than enough for a substantial evening meal.

The lounge also had a good range of wines, spirits and beers, as well as fruit juices, tea and coffee.

Another area we liked in the lounge was the television corner which made a relaxing place to sit that felt a bit like someone’s living room. 

 
In summary, why choose this Hilton, well it’s in a great central location, excellent and well appointed bed rooms and hotel facilities; great food, backed up by outstanding customer service from every single team member we met. It made a perfect relaxing holiday, so much so that we have already booked our next extended stay at this fabulous gem of a hotel.

Thank you for taking the time to share such thoughtful and detailed feedback. We’re truly delighted to hear that you had a great experience with us and appreciated the hotel’s refurbished spaces, central location, and convenient access to Fort Railway Station.

We're especially glad to know that you enjoyed our gym and pool facilities—though I do apologize for the inconvenience accessing the gym before 6am.

Most of all, it warms our hearts to hear your kind words about our team. We’re so sorry your partner was unwell during your stay, but very glad that our team and the onsite nurse were able to assist quickly and with care. It’s our goal to provide thoughtful, guest-centered service, and your appreciation means the world to us.

We’re also thrilled you enjoyed the Executive Lounge experience—our team there will be proud to know their efforts stood out.

Thank you once again for choosing Hilton Colombo. It was a pleasure having you with us, and we look forward to welcoming you both back again soon.

The hotel’s been nicely refurbished and is in a brilliant central location – we were able to walk easily to Fort Railway Station to catch our train to Kandy, which was a bonus.

Facilities-wise, the gym and pool were both solid – the gym had a wide range of well-maintained equipment (especially the treadmills), and it’s supposed to be open 24/7. Slight hiccup there as we couldn’t get in before 6am on the morning we left, but otherwise no complaints.

What really stood out, though, was the staff. They were absolutely fantastic. My partner was taken ill during our stay, and the care we received was honestly above and beyond. There was an onsite nurse, and they quickly got in touch with a local doctor who came to the hotel and was brilliant. They even adjusted some of the menu options so my partner could have something more suitable while recovering. Just really thoughtful, kind people who clearly care about their guests.

We also spent some time in the Executive Lounge (thanks to Hilton Diamond status) and thought it was one of the best we’ve been to – great happy hour spread and a lovely team looking after everyone.

All in all, a huge thank you to everyone at the Hilton Colombo. You really made a difference to our trip, and we’re very grateful.","A big thank you to the team at Hilton Colombo","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306379-r1009067946-Hilton_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391174","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg","1200","0","40","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonkD1512LI","Simon K","AF8E59782023F6D6E919F04C5C8D1C28",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","simonkD1512LI"

In details: We have been to Uga Bay for about two and half weeks and enjoyed everything from the beginning to the end of our vacation! It is really a first time in our experience that the personal is listening to any of the client needs fulfilling these and trying to go a kind of extra mile. The hotel area was really clean, the beach and the pool as well (Eg the rooms have been cleaned three times a day). Around hotel and on the beach there was a security who has taken care of the surrounding area ensuring a really good filling of safety forcing not thinking about the things like keeping mobile phone or like unattended. The food (incl. buffet) was really delicious and manifold. During the breakfast or dinner time the chef came to our table and asked for extra wishes of our children subsequently fulfilling these. The ocean water on the beach seemed to be clean. In general according to the several local opinions it is one of the most beautiful bays on Sri Lanka. Eg one day during our vacation the president of Sri Lanka was just swimming there.

We really liked the service, the cleaning of the rooms, we went to the massage at the beginning of our stay, the beach is the cleanest on Passikuda, while we walking towards the elephant rocks we saw how dirty it was near other hotels. Our beach in Uga Bay was cleaned every day, the security was watching so that no one left entered our territory. All hotel workers are friendly, they will always wish you a good day or a pleasant dinner, special thanks to the man at the reception (I don’t remember the name) who helped us move to another room when one became available. As for food, we had breakfast included, at the egg station at the entrance the cook cooked a very tasty omelet and rice pita (my love), for dinner I would like more days like the ""Buffet"", when you choose a variety of dishes and this dessert bananas with chocolate will forever be in your heart.

Food was outstanding we ate in the restaurant every night, set menu gave lots of options and variety each night, the food was always tasty and high quality! The buffet was only available a couple of nights but both times plenty of choice, delicious and top quality food. We also ate in the beach restaurant most days which was great value for money and food and cocktails delicious! Beach was regularly cleaned so it was immaculate, white sands and clear blue water, ideal for swimming! Pool was spacious and clean and we made good use of this too! The staff are a credit to Uga, there was not one person from the gardeners through to reception staff who wasn’t pleasant and polite, always with a friendly welcome and smile, the service was absolutely outstanding.

Es ist ein tolles Hotel. Das UGA BAY hat einen Traumstrand. Zusätzlich gibt es einen neu renovierten Infinity Pool. Die Zimmer sind groß, sehr sauber und haben Meerblick. Die gesamte Hotelanlage ist sehr gepflegt. Das Essen ist einfach fantastisch.
Das UGA BAY ist für uns etwas ganz Besonderes. Wir erlebten Ruhe und eine Freundlichkeit, die von innen kommt. Es wurde alles dafür getan, dass wir uns richtig wohlfühlen. Alle waren ständig dabei, uns alle Wünsche und Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen. Dieser Service kommt von innen heraus und ist die DNA dieses Hotels. 

Wir haben eine solche Freundlichkeit und einen so tollen Service bislang noch nirgendwo erlebt. Wir hatten einen Traumurlaub!

Eigentlich wollten wir keine Namen nennen und niemanden hervorheben, da wirklich alle einen fantastischen Job gemacht haben. Trotzdem möchten uns wir besonders bedanken bei Pratheep, Munas, Ramani, Nissanka für einen unvergesslichen Service und insbesondere auch bei Lakmal und dem Küchenteam, die uns jeden Tag aufs neue verwöhnt haben.

Trotz aller Superlativen gibt es aber auch einen Punkt, der nicht zum Gesamtbild dieses Hotels passt. Das All Inclusive Paket enthält nur eine sehr eingeschränkte Auswahl von Cocktails, Säften und Softdrinks. Weiter sind Getränke der Minibar kostenpflichtig. Das passt aus unserer Sicht nicht und sollte nachgebessert werden. 

Ganz lieben Dank an das gesamte UGA-BAY-Team !
Wir werden im nächsten Jahr wieder kommen.","Abschalten und genießen – Service und Kulinarik auf allerhöchstem Niveau - ruhiges Hotel mit fantastischem Strand","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r1000441475-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q1043FRwernerb","Werner B","5F54FE01603098CF5C0BEFE2EEC99665",,,,,"Q1043FRwernerb"

Anura the Barman (great sense of humour) and his assistants served us special drinks and was always happy to talk to us every evening when we came out for a drink or for a tea. I do not remember everyone's name, but honestly the entire staff were so pleasant and friendly.

No one else used the main pool; it was just us the whole time, and the view from there was breathtaking! We stayed in the Cinnamon Villa, while our parents were in the other two, but the view from here was also incredibly! The floating breakfast is worth trying; it's an unique experience! The hotel has a Spa section where you can try Balinese massages or Ayurvedic treatments. I had a Balinese massage in the open-air spa surrounded by beautiful nature, and it was very cool!

He struggled to describe his experience. It was a curious combination of excitement and awe which didn’t make sense at the time but piqued my interest. 

I finally did book in for a night in February 2024. I was greeted on arrival at the car park and a buggy was sent over for my bags. At reception were 4 individuals who were ever willing to assist me with any queries I had. A glass of fresh Amberalla (a type of local mango) juice and a 5 min relaxing neck massage from the on-location wellness spa attendant set the tone.

I was curious to see the resort so Gayan; the chief ambassador and I hopped into a buggy. The next 30 mins was most amazing. Even though I now live in the UK; I was born and have lived & worked in Sri Lanka for 25 years but never appreciated the sheer natural beauty that this country has to offer.  Dusk was approaching; the mist and darkness made the distant mountainous terrain look like the backdrop of a movie set. I was privileged to have seen the landscape at that specific time and let the image permeate and imprint itself into my psyche.

The final stop was the spas. Aarunya Resort has an on-site western wellness spa and an Ayurvedic clinic too. I decided on an Ayurveda massage which had me encased in a paste made from indigenous leaves and herbs. The clinic therapist was very knowledgeable and explained the entire process at every step.

Massage complete and now to my room. Each villa is named after the trees/bushes which surround it. I stayed in ‘Pepper’ with ‘Clove’ and ‘Nutmeg’ being about 20 meters further down the path. The villa has it’s own dipping pool with a view of the mountains.  The room was extremely spacious, decorated in a colonial style with an enormous en-suite. A four poster bed, a divan, a seating area and an office desk (with connectivity) occupied the room’s ample space. The free mini bar, some resort-chef made chocolates, Wi-Fi and satellite TV enabled me the home comforts I required for the hour before dinner.

The menu clearly had the luxurious touch and each dish was lovingly crafted and presented. The enormous wine list was quite unique for Sri Lanka too. Truly a 5 star experience.

The next morning, I walked around the resort to marvel at the natural landscape. The resort is situated on 10 acres of land and has 8 private pool villas with incredible views. There is a meeting room, library and a fully equipped gym on-site. Walking though the tea bushes, I discovered an open air tea room which serves high-tea. The rustic yoga studio is next to the spas and was in full swing and so was the village hut where guests learn about local agriculture and partake in a traditional meal made within the hut.

The resort is surrounded by nature trails and is 30mins away from a golf course and also the city of Kandy. Many of the guests had returned from a day’s excursion and relaxation was the focus.

My realisation is that this resort is a labour of love - there is a certain meticulousness to the detail at every turn. From the light switches to the sloping of the roof lights, from the wording on the menu to the presentation on the plate; it’s just so perfectly aligned with the vision of it’s creator.

The breakfast choice was western or Sri Lankan. I chose Sri Lankan and was not disappointed. Six courses of wonderfully prepared local cuisine. Just enough to tickle the taste buds with whole lot of flavour. 

This resort needs to be experienced first-hand. No amount of description can do it justice. I was there barely 24 hours but this experience will live with me forever. Thank you Aarunya Resort, we shall meet again.

Pros:
- Beautiful design and breathtaking view into the djungle (depending on the room type)
- Ideal for relaxing
- Staff is super friendly and always helpful
- Good (but bit pricy) food
- Butler service, in-room dining and minibar free of charge

Cons:
- Especially for Sri Lanka super expensive
- Air condition in tented sky villa is (by principle) not very helpful because the tent heats up super quickly. We tried to let it run almost all the time at the lowest temperature possible and it was still so warm that it was hard to sleep at night
- Condition of tented sky villa and its interior was a bit used and had at some places stains
- Location is a bit remote between Kandy and Dambulla - consider this if you plan to make trips to Kandy, Dambulla or Sigiriya","Real blizz with some minor cons","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d14267789-r941984329-Aarunya_Nature_Resort_Sri_Lanka-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","10","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DESM0NDMILES","Desmond Miles","3E4AF6B9B42E15A63000955D3227ECA3",,,,,"DESM0NDMILES"

Thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed and thoughtful review of your recent stay with us at Hilton Yala Resort. It was truly a pleasure meeting you, and I sincerely appreciate your candid feedback.

I regret that aspects of your experience, particularly regarding the all-inclusive offering, did not meet your expectations. Your concerns were completely understandable, and I appreciate the opportunity you gave us to address them during your stay. As you noted, we have since updated our website to ensure greater clarity in our offerings, and I truly value your insights in helping us improve.

On a more positive note, I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the exceptional quality of our villas, food, and safaris. It means a lot to know that you found the Premium Pool Villa to be one of the best suites you’ve stayed in and that your experience with Sam on safari was so enjoyable. I will personally share your kind words with Hashini, Vishmi, Shamal, and the rest of the team, who will be thrilled to know they made a positive impression.

Your feedback is invaluable, and we take it to heart as we continue refining our guest experience. It was a pleasure having you with us, and I truly hope we will have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future for an even more seamless and memorable stay. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly should you ever decide to return—I would be more than happy to personally assist with your arrangements.

Experience Yala with a daily safari and all-inclusive dining and free flow alcohol'. After checking in we were taken to our villa and advised that the free flow alcohol was only available during lunch and dinner service and did not include any items from the villa mini-bar which were all chargeable. We requested that this be checked as the room rate was extremely high (more than we payed at nearby Uga Chena Huts which was an incredible all inclusive stay). The staff member left our villa and called us about 10 minutes later reaffirming what she had told us earlier. 

We were in the foyer when General Manager Gitanjali approached us. We had a conversation regarding the advertised all inclusive rate and the restrictions we were now advised of (which were certainly not advertised anywhere), showing her the Yala Hilton website, and requested whether we could cancel our booking and return to Uga Chena Huts. Gitanjali was very understanding, checked the advertised rate on the website and listened to our concerns. She agreed that the website did not advise of any of the restrictions, and agreed that the alcohol menu from the all inclusive lunch and dinner service would be made available to us for the duration of our stay (by the main pool, pre and after dinner drinks etc).  Unfortunately this is an extremely limited menu that consists mainly of soft drinks, milkshakes and juices with a choice of one red or white wine and limited cocktail or spirits. 

On our last day we were informed that there were a number of mini-bar items available free of charge daily in our villa (beer and soft drink) that we were previously advised were all chargeable, this was disappointing. 

We experienced a number of ongoing service issues during the stay, where the all inclusive alcohol menu was refused, which required this issue to be unfortunately addressed a number of times each day. Fortunately it was resolved satisfactorily on each occasion with the assistance of Gitanjali or Front Office Manager Vino. We found both Gitanjali and Vino to be excellent; they were both friendly, intuitive and professional. 

The Hilton Yala Resort is one of the most luxurious and high quality resorts that we have stayed in anywhere in the world. The small number of suites and villas means that the large resort never fills too busy or overcrowded. The main pool is absolutely spectactular and one of the best resort pools you will come across. 

The food was of an exceptional quality and we had a number of great meals, with the chef happy to make variations for dietary requirements. The breakfast, lunch and dinner meals were all exceptional. The Hopper X Benny was the absolute standout breakfast meal! 

Service was exceptional and the staff at Hilton Yala Resort are well trained, we received amazing service from Hashini, Vishmi and Shamal during our meals. 

We did two safari drives with Sam the Ranger / Guide and they were great. The quality of vehicles and drivers used were excellent, Sam was very informative and passionate and made the experience very enjoyable. 

The Premium Pool Villa was exceptional! One of the best hotel suites that we have ever stayed in! Extremely spacious, well appointed and very modern with the latest technology and high class linen and fittings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linen and towels of the highest quality. The pool was phenomenal and we spent loads of time in it. 

It it wasn't for the service issues and advertising issue regarding the all inclusive rate, this would have been easily a five star review and stay. Having to deal with this a number of times a day slightly ruined what would have otherwise been an incredible experience. The price Hilton charges for an all inclusive rate where alcohol is only served during lunch and dinner is not all inclusive and does not represent value when compared to nearby Uga Chena Huts or Wild Coast Tented Lodge which both have exceptional all inclusive offerings. 

I note after our stay, Hilton Yala Resort has corrected their website which now states 'Safari all inclusive. Experience Yala with a daily safari incl dining, free flow alcohol during meals.'","All Inclusive is NOT an All Inclusive rate with significant restrictions and availability","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r1000202442-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","29","94","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petergY9057JV","Peter G","C9D25E938AD56FE83BED5F4C7AD6A68A",,,,,"petergY9057JV"

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We truly appreciate your kind words about our service and the safari experience, and we understand your perspective on the overall atmosphere.

As Hilton Yala is uniquely located inside the national park, guest safety is our top priority. The requirement for a ranger to access the beach and the use of buggies after dark are important safety measures due to the presence of wildlife in the area. These precautions ensure a secure and immersive experience while respecting the natural habitat surrounding us.

Regarding the safari experience, we recognize that Block 1 can get quite busy, especially during leopard sightings. For guests seeking a more tranquil and immersive experience, we often recommend exploring other areas such as Block 5, which offers breathtaking landscapes and abundant wildlife in a quieter setting.

We sincerely appreciate your constructive feedback and hope to welcome you again for another memorable stay, perhaps with a fresh perspective on the diverse and untamed beauty of Yala.

Auch die Tatsache, dass man an den Strand nur mit Ranger darf (auf die Idee zu schwimmen würde man an der Stelle sowieso nicht kommen) und einen Buggy braucht, um sich bei Dunkelheit in de Anlage zu bewegen (und es gab nie Wartezeiten) - fühlt sich komisch an. 
Die beiden Safaris mit dem Ranger waren sehr gut, viele Erklärungen und tolle Eindrücke. Als dann ein Leopard gesichtet wurde begann der Stress. Alle Jeeps fuhren a die Stelle, nach Schlangestehen und Retten eines anderen Jeeps haben wir ihn auch gesehen.

Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent stay at Hilton Yala Resort. We sincerely regret that your experience did not meet expectations and appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.

Regarding your check-in and payment process, we apologize for any miscommunication. As your stay consisted of back-to-back reservations booked using points, our system required a re-check-in and incidental payment for the new reservation. This was explained upon arrival and kindly reminded before your safari. However, as this was not completed, our team had to request the payment to proceed with the check-in. Additionally, we regret the oversight in selecting the incorrect currency when processing your payment, which resulted in the transaction being declined.

For clarification, the 25% Hilton Diamond discount was applied to the food charges. Upon further review, the same discount was also extended to the beverage items. The revised total before taxes and service charges amounted to LKR 49,275.00, and after applying the applicable 34.34% taxes and service charge (LKR 16,921.04), the correct final total was LKR 66,196.04.

Initially, an incorrect amount of LKR 75,129.64 was charged to your Amex card. To rectify this, a credit card refund of LKR 8,933.61 was processed, ensuring that the final amount charged was correctly adjusted to LKR 66,196.03. The voided transaction details were shared with you via WhatsApp on the same day.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the room temperature. Our engineering team inspected the system, and to ensure your comfort, an alternative room was offered solely for the purpose of sleeping, so you could rest comfortably without needing to pack and unpack your belongings. You would have been able to return to your original room in the morning and pack at your convenience before check-out. Your feedback has been shared with our team to improve service and provide a more seamless resolution process in the future.

Regarding your service experience, we regret that you felt uncomfortable during the payment process. Our intention was never to inconvenience you, and we will be reviewing our approach to ensure a more guest-friendly resolution in similar situations.

As a gesture of goodwill, we were pleased to offer a complimentary dessert during your dinner on February 25th. We truly value your loyalty as a Hilton Diamond member and sincerely hope to welcome you back for a more seamless experience in the future.

Please do not hesitate to reach out should you require any further assistance.

1. Hilton Diamond member privilege
(a) I presented my Hilton credit card for incidental charges at check-in (Feb 24); however, the front desk staff informed me that the credit card deposit was not necessary., I was assured that I could settle the charges upon my departure check-out.  As a Hilton Diamond member, the front desk staff recognized my Diamond member status and acknowledged the 25% discount on Food & Beverage and Spa service.  
(b) On the 2nd day (Feb 25) when I returned to the resort in the evening after the safari tour, the front desk informed me that my credit card (credit card record from Hilton booking portal) declined the dinner transaction on Feb 24. The staff requested my credit card to settle the dinner payment.  Since I didn’t carry my credit card in the resort, I asked if I could pay the dinner bills altogether at check-out tomorrow (Feb 26), the staff insisted I must resolve the payment immediately.  After the dinner, the front desk staff took the credit card machine with him and accompanied me to my room.  At my room, the front desk staff showed me the total amount of 75,129.64 LKR to be billed which includes 2 dinner payment - tonight's dinner (Feb 25) and last night's dinner (Feb 24) payment; however, my credit card was declined, so I asked him to try it again, the 2nd attempt was successful.  Later, I received an email alert message from the credit card company that the amount of 75,129.64 USD was declined due to exceeding my credit limit.  In reality, there was nothing wrong with my credit card.  The front desk staff charged the incorrect currency which is why the payment couldn’t be processed. 
(c) At check-out on Feb 26, I reported to the front desk that the Diamond member 25% discount on Food & Beverage was not given to the Beverage items on both Feb 24 and Feb 25 dinner.  The front desk staff reviewed my bills and confirmed the errors, the correct amount should have been 49,275.00 LKR, and it was processed to my credit card right away.  The front desk staff told me that they will void the transaction of the incorrect amount of 75,129.64 LKR and will send me a receipt.  As of today March 7, I still have not received the void receipt.

2. Malfunction AC system
(a) The room temperature remained at 20 celsius degrees.  The temperature was unable to be adjusted, it could not be set to my desired temperature at 25 celsius degrees and as a result, I had to turn off the AC system during my 2-night stay. While I appreciate the General Manager's apology, I am disappointed that no compensation was offered for the significant inconvenience I experienced at a 5-stars Hilton resort. 
(b) I reported about the freezing cold room temperature on both the first and second days of my stay.  Despite confirmation that a technician had inspected the issue, the AC system was not repaired. The front desk offered an alternative room for sleeping only, which I declined due to the impracticality of packing and unpacking my belongings for a single night.

3. Bad Customer Service 
(a) Furthermore, I was insulted by the handling of my payment.  Being escorted to my room to settle the bill a day before departure due to a front desk error is unacceptable.  If the matter was urgent, I should have been informed at breakfast on the second day when the credit card rejection occurred.  This level of customer service is unacceptable for a 5-star establishment.","Terrible and Unpleasant","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r997006831-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awyy","awyy","9CD850EB99F5D691E3E1B38FB2E9A483",,"28953","New York","New York","awyy"

What an amazing resort. The best hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka. It worth the price.

The welcome was amazing from the moment we stepped in. Monkeys were playing on the roof of the hotel.

Lobby is very modern with a view on the resort.

Bedroom is like a villa. Huge, very clean, comfortable. We had our own pool which was a little bit colder than the main pool but still very nice. 
Bathroom was the best part of the room. One of the biggest I have ever had. Very modern. 

Housekeeping did an amazing job making up our room twice a day, that was great because of the dust from the safaris.
Towels and toileteries were replenished twice a day.
Bottled water was complimentary.

The main pool was very warm and lovely. I loved it.

The restaurant was very well decorated. You can eat inside and outside. Both were great.
Food was very tasty, but more expensive than anywhere else in Sri Lanka. 
Breakfast and diner were both amazing.

We had a safari from another compagny than Hilton. They picked us up in front of the lobby and the hotel was very closed to the National Park.
There is no barrier between the park and the hotel (we saw an elephant very close to the hotel). That explains the few restrictions inside the hotel (no room service).

It's the first Hilton of this kind.
And it totally worth it.","Amazing experience !","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r995098915-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"412","41954069","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/80/2b/15/caro-et-nono.jpg","550","126","483","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroUsTrip","CaroUsTrip","79F70E8E2E7DD4F0CCF7954B468373C3",,"187147","Paris, France","Paris","CaroUsTrip"

He always ensured a safe and comfortable ride on the day trips which were organized by the hotel.  

The service at the restaurant and bar was also fantastic! Sajeevu, one of our waiters, was incredibly attentive, always greeting us with a smile and making sure we had everything we needed. His recommendations were excellent, and his friendly personality made dining even more enjoyable.  

Anura, one of the bartenders,  deserves praise as well. His company was always very pleasant and he took a great interest in the guests. He always proved to be a very good conversationalist.

Я мало где видела отзывы в период февраль-март, поэтому поделюсь своим мнением.

Погода. Прогноз погоды показывал грозы и дожди и запаслась настолками, чтобы не скучать в номере. Но оказалось все не так страшно. Дождь шел 15 минут 2 раза в день (честное слово) а дальше был рай, тепло (я ходила в шертах и футболке спокойно), влажно и пасмурно (если любите дикую жару и сонцепек вам может не понравится) Но я как уральский человек тяжело переношу сильную жару, поэтому была в диком восторге от погоды. В этот период мы гуляли по пляжу и окрестностям, наслаждались природой и отелем. Флаг был красный и мы купались в бассейне, хотя были и те кто купался в море. Но сгореть я умудрилась и через тучки 😁 на 4 день выглянуло солнце и начались дни купания на море, оно было теплое как парное молоко, вода голубенькая, песок белый. Пляж охраняемых и очень красивый. В общем, для себя отмечу это период сезоном для курорта Пасикуда острова Шри-Ланка 🫶

Про отель 🤔 Я выбирала между 3 отелями.
Первый был дороже, но у него были сложности с заходом в море. Сегодня прогулялись до него и правда, заход весь в обломках кораллов, хотя сам по себе отель красивый. 

Второй был дешевле и находится прямо рядом с нашим, но по отзывам там уставшие номера. Тоже сходила, посмотрела, визуально менее эффектный чем наш, но вполне уютный. 

А в этот отель я влюбилась с первых фото и окончательное решение мне помог принять высокий рейтинг отеля!! Я не ожидала, что такие рейтинги вообще бывают на более чем 2000 отзывов. 

Номера. Очень просторные и красивые. Уборка 2 раза в день 😱 без напоминаний, все было идеально чисто. У каждого дома стоит дерево Плюмерии, цветы, которого безумно вкусно пахнут. По утрам поют птицы.
Все номера стоят таким образом, что вы точно будете видеть кусочек море и много красивой зелени. 
 
Еда. Очень вкусная еда. Мы брали завтраки и ужины и для нас это было более чем достаточно. Я даже немного поправилась. 
Утром шведский стол (напитки входят в стоимость) Вечером у нас было по меню, но нереально вкусно и красиво. Бывали острые блюда, но вы можете перед заказом поговаривать, что не хотите острое и вам будут делать не острое 😁 все просто. Напитки оплачиваются отдельно (но это стандартно) вам приносят чеки, вы их подписываете и оплачиваете все при выезде.

Пляж. Не ну это просто рай!!! Прекрасный, широкий пляж. Который каждый день чистят. Белый песок, голубая водичка. Насколько я знаю белый песок не распространен на Шри-Ланке. А здесь именно он.

Территория.  Безумно зеленая, красивая. Бассейн, который визуально уходит в море. У лежаков бассейна вместо зонтиков изгородь из живых растений 💘 

Персонал. Я нигде не встречала настолько ответсвенных и доброжельных и отзывчивых людей. Ты прямо чувствуешь заботу и понимание со стороны КАЖДОГО сторудника. Все улыбаются, но не навязчивы. Я всегда выбираю отели 4-5* и очень критична к ним. Чаще отели мне не нравятся, чем наоборот, но тут даже я не нашла к чему придраться 🫶

Отель заботится о природе и не использует пластик. Все из бамбука, картона и бумаги, что тоже украшает имидж отеля.

Как оказалось отель Uga имеет целую сеть на Шри-Ланке. И я уже запланировала отдых в один из них.","Лучший отель.

Every morning, when I went to meet the sunrise, the gardeners, the guys who take care of the cleanliness of the territory and the beach from 5 am were already working like bees and at the same time the kitchen started working, which by 7 am prepared an excellent breakfast for us🙏By the way, when it comes to food, there is a huge selection of food, European cuisine and you can also try their local, which of course I spoiled myself with😊Everything is very fresh, waiters fly around you and constantly take care of you. By the way, even the chef sometimes approaches the guests and asks if everything is in order. The manager gathers the staff every evening before dinner and talks with them, apparently about the organization of everything, so everything works as it should watches. each of the service staff, from cleaners to managers, everyone greets you with a smile and asks how are you? what day have you had? they are interested in whether you are enjoying your vacation or everything is comfortable for you. I write a lot, because during my 10 days of vacation, I observed the details of the human attitude of the staff to the guests. they do not treat, because this is according to the rules, they have a soul and heart, they are really interested in you! They tell you and offer different opportunities, what you can see in their country or where it is better to go, what you need to pay attention to, and this is not for money, but just like that, without expecting anything in return! Everything is super in the hotel, I really liked it, I will be glad to return to them 🙏 the only thing you need to pay attention to if you choose this country is that you need to count on the fact that their alcohol is imported, that is why the price is high, plus they have a service percentage plus more something, so when you order something, it's better to clarify the final cost, so that you won't be surprised by the bills later😊But this didn't affect my wonderful vacation in this country in any way. Plus I got there on Valentine's Day, here of course the staff tried very hard to show the guests how they prepared for this day😊I'll definitely give photos and videos below.","I have extremely good impressions and I wrote everything else above in the reviews","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r994151126-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3107QKirynas","Iryna S","0C0B1ECCF5FF02AF13EFB6B9483A3CE7",,,,,"I3107QKirynas"

Unlike many hotels in that area it has a very wide beachfront area. It is set in a  well tended and manicured garden.
We had an ocean view room with a fabulous view across the beach and trees. The room was very spacious and comfortable and had everything you might need, including fridge ,safe, excellent A/C and a luxurious bathroom with plenty of hot water and a powerful shower.
The staff are very welcoming helpful and courteous.
The buffet breakfast was delicious and offered a whole range of Western and Sri Lankan dishes. 

If I were to offer any negative points it would be that the buffet dinner is quite expensive at 40$ per person. Also the beach bar plays music from 10.30am throughout the whole day. This can get pretty irritating when you're trying to relax and listen to the waves. Fortunately it is less intense if you go well off to one side of the beach. Maybe the hotel could offer quieter times on the beach?

All in all I do think this is a very good luxury stay and I would certainly return in the future.","The best hotel in Passikudah","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d3682420-r994126655-Uga_Bay-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"2592","607931334","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/3c/4b/c6/madeleine-i.jpg","2592","3","52","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719madeleinei","Madeleine I","CA48C87B276E01386B04FB7055FCEA5E",,,,,"719madeleinei"

Here, Cape Weligama (Relais & Chateaux) stands out as the premier destination. This renowned hotel boasts 39 boutique villas and suites spread across 5 hectares of a former coconut grove on the dramatically picturesque Cape Weligama. The primary draw of this location is the stunning views, views, and more views.

The Ocean Terrace Restaurant, where guests gather for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is perched on a cliff, providing an unparalleled vantage point to take in some of the best scenery imaginable. 

Cape Weligama also offers three secret spots—secluded areas perfect for watching the sunset. Each spot is equipped with a table and chairs, and can be reserved for a romantic lunch or dinner. 

The villas themselves are spacious, each covering at least 130 square meters, and are built in the local architectural style. Each villa features its own private pool (shared between two or three villas) and a spacious terrace furnished with a table, sun loungers, and a sofa. It's an idyllic spot to sip tea while listening to the tunes of Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.

The cuisine at Cape Weligama is another highlight. Talented chefs deliver an impressive culinary experience starting with breakfast. However, the evening meals truly showcase their skills. A standout feature is the Chef's Table at the Tableau restaurant, where a seven-course dinner is prepared before your eyes. This culinary journey includes appetizers, soups, sorbets, main courses, and desserts, making for an unforgettable dining experience.

Chef Ishara Wijesinghe has honed his craft in various countries including Dubai over a 20-year career. He returned to his homeland to perfect his skills in Sri Lankan cuisine, infusing it with European gastronomic techniques. The result is exceptional—his cooking method could easily earn a Michelin star. Guests can ask about the secrets of local cuisine, get excellent recipes, and engage in conversations about global culinary traditions and life in general.

For those seeking adventure, Cape Weligama offers a variety of activities, from surfing lessons and whale watching excursions to guided tours of nearby tea plantations and historic sites. In conclusion, Cape Weligama is not just a place to stay; it's a destination that offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and immersive cultural experiences.","Wonderful Stay","2024-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r952674682-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"433","744681726","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/62/f0/fe/irinamv708cw.jpg","433","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irmaberg77","Irina Malkova","AFA156BBD7C4A8E53E4FC7ACC8264C89",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","irmaberg77"

Everything was absolutely amazing. The food was so delicious and the views were supreme. The highlight of our stay was your incredible staff! They were genuinely interested in our comfort and always went above and beyond to make our stay the best ever. Lahiru, Mahendra - our curator and Pradeep were so warm and friendly and we truly appreciate their efforts. Manula from F&B was the absolute star during our stay - he honestly went above and beyond and was the most pleasant person to deal with! Manula assisted us both during breakfast and dinner and at the end of our stay we felt like he was part of our family! My husband accidentally cut his toe on a stone and Manula rushed to get ice and a band aid and was so lovely during the situation. 

As a Front Office Manager myself in Melbourne, I truly appreciate and value outstanding service in the hospitality industry and am so proud to call myself Sri Lankan when I experience stays such as these. Your staff truly seemed like they loved their job as it shows by the way they work!

I can easily say that my husband and I will be dreaming of our honeymoon at Cape Weligama for months and years to come.

From the incredible hospitality, to the cliffside views looking at the surfers below, to the delicious Sri Lankan and Western breakfasts and dinners, and to the beautiful rooms, this place deserves all of the accolades. This was our last stop of our (a couple) Sri Lanka trip and it was the perfect ending. Shaun was absolutely wonderful, greeted us at check in and hosted us the entire trip, ensuring our stay was top notch! He was a gem. The sincere nature of all of the staff also did not go unnoticed. All of the butlers, to bartenders, to maintenance around the property to the managers, were genuine and sincere to see you. Another highlight was tasting the different fruit or flavor infused arracks at the Surf Bar onsite. The drinks the bartenders made with those arracks were unreal! 

We stayed in the master suite, and the room was huge with a large private deck with seating. The all wood walk in closet was a nice touch to tuck away our suitcases out of the way, and the rainfall shower was the best treat after a swim at the beach nearby. The shower room also turns into a steam room, although we didn’t try it. And the half moon infinity pool! Highly recommend a swim there at dusk, as it’s pretty incredible to watch the sun go down and surfers below. 

All in all, our hands down favorite part of our trip was Cape Weligama! There’s not enough words to say how special this stay was. We will be returning in the future!","Seven stars!","2024-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d6765047-r944935680-Cape_Weligama_Relais_Chateaux-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","2","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel4637","Mel4637","5E4CF7C3F07636E20CDD600C053BA22F",,"60763","New York City, New York","New York City","Mel4637"

The Cape Weligama hotel is at the luxury end of the market price wise but mostly lives up to expectations. The villa was beautiful and we shared the private pool with only one other villa (tbh we had it to ourselves most of the time) and housekeeping by Sadasheena and Vimukthi was fantastic. We were there for 13 nights, started on half board for one week then cancelled that for the 2nd to give us a bit more freedom of choice as the evening menu did not appear to change.
We got out and about using a brilliant local tuk tuk driver, Viraj +94 773969530, who was a very safe, honest and reliable driver and I highly recommend using him. He lives with his family a few hundred yards from the hotel and would appreciate the work.
Inoka looked after us on arrival and Madushan was invaluable in making our departure so easy and stress free.

We are extremely delighted to hear your star comment on The Beach All Suite Hotel.

The Beach All Suite is always on top notch of satisfying guest needs most efficient and prompt manner. It is solely because of our dedicated service crew and their inattentiveness towards responding guest requirements on time. Moreover our restaurants at both ground and roof top have captured most our guest attention as of it's unique food and beverage and the quality service. 

Specially our short distance to the airport has become an extra advantage for the guest to reach their flights on time.

WiFi was poor as it kept breaking up.  No real access to beach (unless walk around) since gate is closed to stop vendors from coming in to pool area.  This was a real disappointment since I love the beach and not pool.  This could have been fixed by having a security guard at gate.

This is for your understanding, as we are located adjacent to the catholic church apply for liquor licence is very remote. However, we do promote our guest to bring their own booze and enjoy themselves.

The view of the beach was lovely and the rooms were great for the price which was about £70 a night. Although, we had to wait for our room to finish being cleaned when we arrived and we didn’t have towels in the room as they hadn’t come back from the laundrette yet. The pool area didn’t have a bar and we had to ask for even a soft drink. I don’t think they serve alcohol at all as we noticed the rooftop restaurant said BYOB. We swerved and went to a local one (the claws) down the road. If you want breakfast, you also have to let them know the day before as it seemed like they wouldn’t be set up otherwise. The local beach bars about 50m away were really good, although tonnes of stray dogs and crows. This hotel is missing a trick not having their own beach area!

The main gate faces York Street and will be easy to find with the signs. They will check your vehicle before you enter the premises, after which, you can drop your passengers off at the main entrance while you go and park in either the above-ground car park or their underground one. You must allow security to scan your bags and guide you through a metal detector before entering the lobby. The hotel is wheelchair-accessible and family-friendly. Aside from it being a hotel, there are a lot of other facilities, activities, and amenities available here such as restaurants, lounges, wifi, and water features to name a few. Additionally, everything was maintained well, the hygiene was top-tier, and the customer service and staff hospitality was great.
It was rather peaceful with a formal setting when I and my family went to both the Graze Kitchen and the L.A.B. lounge for lunch and tea. The food and drink in both were delicious, with good dessert options and the quality was excellent. If you ever go, I recommend the Chinese food options in Graze and the Cookies at L.A.B.

Housekeeping was available daily upon request.

The food was delicious - we were lucky to have a buffet almost every day, and even the à la carte dinners were excellent! Even without an all-inclusive package, there were plenty of fruits and non-alcoholic drinks. But if you drink a lot of water, be prepared to ask the staff for extra bottles, as the standard allocation is two 0.5L bottles per day. 

Objectively, the best beach along the entire coast - clean with a gentle entry into the ocean. The staff was wonderful - special greetings to Ayesh and Danujan.

This is a perfect place for a peaceful getaway. Few people, stunning landscapes, breathtaking sunrises - we would gladly return.

p.s. There are a few local dogs near the hotel, and we unfortunately witnessed, to put it mildly, inhumane treatment of them by beach staff. That is not ok! When we told our concerns, the response was that the dogs bark and disturb guests, though, in our experience, they caused no trouble. The hotel administration should to handle this issue in a calm manner - both for people and animals.","Wonderful relaxing stay and the best beach in Pasikudah","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r1013413234-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,,,,,"0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaroslavar2021","Yaroslava R","BB571BB248678820629D180C55DF8F6A",,"294473","Ukraine","Ukraine","yaroslavar2021"

Очень много зелени, магнолии цветут (и не только), все ухожено. Единственный минус - долго добираться, трансфер 7 часов, но мы знали на что идем, так как май переходной месяц, на западном побережье отдыхать в дожди не хотелось. Тем более хотелось спокойной обстановки, только песок и океан. Бывало мы были одни на пляже, людей очень мало. Так что оно того стоило, однозначно.
Вся территория в травке, пальмах и тд. Огромный бассейн, через который идут мостики, как в сказке! В пруду живут рыбки, черепахи и КРОКОДИЛ! Со стороны столовой (которая на свежем воздухе) можно посмотреть, попросить хлебушек у персонала, чтобы выманить его. Персонал вежливый, на английски можно договориться. Номер шикарный, уборка каждый день, постель, полотенца, шампуни и тд. В общем великолепно!
Пляж - это вообще огонь. Пологий вход, песочек мягкий, все очень чисто. Океан прямо обжигает, никогда не думала, что может такая теплая быть вода! Мы ходили вдоль бухты, могу сказать - наш отель самый крутой! Там гораздо меньше зелени, обычные бассейны и пляжи уже ближе к рифу - естественно с кораллами, ноги ободрать можно. А около Амайи вообще песок завозной лежит в белых мешках (видимо забыли высыпать, кинули прямо так), это вообще кошмар. 
Если пройтись в другую сторону - пляж Элефант рок бич, с огромными валунами, но там живут местные,естественно  очень грязно, но посмотреть стоит.
Еда: хорошо, что взяли только завтраки. Еда специфическая. Кушали в кафе в полутора км от отеля. Ездили на тук-туке, заплатили 1000 рупий туда и обратно. На следующий день на ресепшене ��ернули деньги, оказывается покушать от отеля возят бесплатно!!!! Мы были в 4х кафешках, больше всего понравился Синамон, цены примерно везде одинаковые, на троих один прием пищи 9000-11000 рупий выходит (это каждый день креветки, крабы и кальмары с напитками). 
Погода была шикарная, один раз шел дождь, океан после него стал попрохладнее, конечно, но это не помешало!
Анимации конечно нет вообще никакой! Ну это деревенька, мы ехали отдохнуть от суеты, нам она и не нужна была. В общем, спасибо огромное за отдых!!! Сбылась мечта! С удовольствием вернулась бы!","Лучший отдых в моей жизни!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r1010671500-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","0","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_N8228BZ","Кристина Л","59305B1EA9EC4D0E74A46B9F0AD5583C",,,,,"_N8228BZ"

The food was delicious, and the overall experience made us feel genuinely special and celebrated.

After the wedding, we stayed on as a couple for two more days, and the surprises kept coming. romantic outdoor dinners, a beautifully arranged honeymoon room setup, and many more thoughtful touches that made our stay unforgettable.

Рекомендую всем, кто хочет в тишине и спокойствии восстановить силы. Отель в Балийском стиле с большой зеленой ухоженной территорий, просторные номера со всем необходимым. Чистейший пляж и у нас был очень спокойный океан - просто сказка. Пологий вход в океан и белый Мальдивский песок - такого комфортного пляжа я еще не видела. Нет анимации и музыки - идеально подходит для спокойного отдыха, полный релакс. Персонал очень приветливый и услужливый - большинство говорит по-английски, у нас никаких сложностей не возникло. Команда создает максимальное ощущение уюта и заботы - стараются максимально выполнить ваши ожидания, но при этом совсем не навязываются. Питание в ресторане нам понравилось, всегда были хорошие фрукты, морепродукты, курица, мясо, в основном все не острое. Несколько раз было обслуживание по меню, нам понравилось даже больше, чем буфет. Местами отелю нужно обновление (полотенца на пляже износились и постельное белье), но везде все чисто и ухоженно, и в общем в такой красоте на такие мелочи не обращаешь внимания. Солнце тут очень активное – запасайтесь кремами, так как в ближайших магазинах очень скудный ассортимент. В аптеках в основном аюверда, поэтому запас своих лекарств тоже лучше взять с собой. На территории был хороший wi-fi. Также по прилету в аэропорту можно купить e sim за 10$ на неделю безлимитного интернета.

Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay in April 2025.

We’re happy to hear you appreciated our beautiful beach and that our staff made you feel welcome — it truly means a lot to us.

That said, we’re very sorry to learn that other parts of your experience fell short of expectations. We’ve taken your comments seriously and would like to address a few key points:

Room Condition & Cleanliness: We regret the issues you experienced and have shared your feedback with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to ensure rooms and balconies are properly checked and cleaned before every stay.

Food Options: While we aim to offer a good variety, we understand your concerns and are currently working on expanding and improving our menu to better meet guest expectations.

Room Assignment: We apologize for the inconvenience and delay in relocating your room. Guest comfort — especially for families with young children — is very important to us. We are reviewing our processes to handle such requests more efficiently and empathetically.

Hot Water & Room Checks: We agree this should not have happened. Our team is reinforcing room readiness checks to avoid similar issues in the future.

Pigeons and Animals on Property: Being in a natural beachfront location, occasional bird activity is hard to avoid, but we’re working on better control methods. Regarding the friendly dogs, while they are not under our care, we appreciate your concern and are discussing ways to support their welfare more responsibly.

We're sorry your experience didn’t reflect the level of service we aim to provide. Please know we are taking your feedback seriously and making improvements. We hope you might consider staying with us again so we can show you a much better experience.

Warm regards,

The staff were warm, friendly, and helpful.
The beach is absolutely beautiful.

Cons
Very limited food options — definitely not up to 5-star standards.
Rooms are poorly maintained; balconies were dirty with bird droppings, and the bathroom setup was below expectations.
Rooms had a noticeable moldy smell.
Pillows and mattresses were uncomfortable and in need of replacement.
The property had a significant pigeon issue, resulting in excessive bird droppings in common areas.
Basic room checks were not conducted — no hot water in the bathroom initially, and the TV remote didn’t have working batteries.
Despite traveling with a toddler, we were given a room on a higher floor far from the dining area. Requests for a lower-floor room were declined due to supposed unavailability, showing a lack of basic empathy and training.
We had to wait over an hour for hot water just to take a shower.
After escalating the issue to the supervisor, we were finally offered a room on a lower floor — contradicting what the front desk had previously told us.
The property has friendly dogs, which some guests might find bothersome. However, the real issue is the hotel's lack of care — the dogs aren’t fed or looked after and rely on guests for food scraps. Given the amount of food waste at the property, this is something the management should address.

На пляже почти нет волн, так как отель расположен в бухте. Персонал в отеле - это сказочные эльфы! Дружелюбные, внимательные, вежливые, особенно в ресторане. 
В ресторане всегда разнообразная и вкусная еда, есть курица, рыба, морепродукты, говядина, свинина, много фруктов, и никогда ничего не заканчивается, даже если вы приходите под конец завтрака или ужина.
Номера в интересном стиле, всё удобно и продуманно, но уже пора сделать ремонт - это единственный минус.

Из интересных бонусов на территории (прямо под трассой ресторана) есть озеро с большим количеством рыбок и черепах, а также в нем есть крокодил! Также на территории можно увидеть довольно большого варана.  
Комната большая, светлая. Если у вас пропадает по ночам сахар в стиках, не волнуйтесь, это местные белочки😀
Об ресторане ничего плохого сказать не могу. Официанты очень внимательны, вежливые и обходительные. Особенно Danujan. 
Я в бассейне не купался, но в этом отеле он самый большой и красивый. 
Пляж меня чуть чуть разочаровал:( 
В принципе ничем не отличается от других отелей в бухте, но ПЛАСТИК на пляже для отеля такого уровня Недопустим! Садовники каждое утро сгрибают листья, а пластик в упор не видят 🙃 
Пожалуйста, администрация отеля, обратите внимание на мусор на пляже!
И не только на песке, а и в цветах на песке где его надо собирать Руками:) , а не граблями. И убирать весь пляж, а не только там где есть шезлонги!!!
Также из минусов в отеле не работает Spa,  отправляют в соседний отель Calm.
Делал массаж в Malu Malu, вообще не понравился. Гид сказал, что массаж хороший делают только в середине острова. 
В целом общее впечатление осталось хорошее. И я думаю, что выбрал лучший вариант в Passikudah. 
Каждый должен расставить приоритеты и чем-то пожертвовать. 
Кстати, в отеле нигде нет никакой музыки. 
Кому нужны тишина и покой - вам сюда. 

Теперь касаемо погоды. В марте за три недели нашего пребывания штиль утром был 4 - 6 раз. В остальные дни перекаты.
После обеда поднимается рябь и волны. Штиль после обеда был 2 раза.
Дожди были часто, но они почти всегда очень быстро заканчиваются. 
По моим наблюдениям волны и дождь друг от друга не зависят. Если океан разыгрался, это где-то на 3 дня. Потому что, это океан:) Плескаться можно всегда, а плавать в волны не очень.","Честный отзыв на отель Anantaya Resort and Spa","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r1001109442-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimbB827JL","Karim B","6B67AC931F964318BE39737C22C935DE",,,,,"karimbB827JL"

The lady receptionist was very professional and polite, and she explained us the hotel facilities. Then we were taken to the lounge for welcome drinks. I personally loved the mirrors in the lobby washroom. Lobby washrooms were super clean. We met a very nice gentleman at the lounge Mr. Asela and he was very friendly and polite. He assist us with the rooms and the rooms were super clean and spacious. Specially we need that as we have 2 kids who love to play on the floor 🤩. We enjoyed our evening by the rooftop pool and the jacuzzi…. And it was very relaxing. I must mention the restaurant staff was very helpful and the breakfast buffet was absolutely fantastic… we enjoyed all the Sri Lankan items in one corner.

Thank you for your feedback and for highlighting the things you enjoyed — especially our beautiful grounds, large pool, and the efforts of our staff. We're glad these aspects made a positive impression.

We’re sorry, however, to hear that some parts of your stay didn’t meet expectations.

Beach and Lounger Maintenance: We appreciate your comments and have already taken steps to improve the regular cleaning and upkeep of our beach and poolside areas.

Free-Roaming Dogs: While the dogs around the property are generally friendly and part of the local surroundings, we understand not all guests are comfortable with them. We are working on better ways to manage this in a responsible and guest-friendly manner.

Food Variety: Thank you for your feedback about our kitchen offerings. We're reviewing our menus and bakery practices to ensure more variety and fresher options moving forward.

Your comments help us improve, and we truly hope to welcome you again in the future for a better experience.

Warm regards,

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback following your recent stay with us at Anantaya Resort Passikudah.

While we’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the beach and pool, we’re truly sorry to learn that several aspects of your visit did not meet your expectations. We understand how frustrating delays and small service lapses can be, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

March is a quieter season for us, and while we do conduct staff training during this time, it is our responsibility to ensure that guest service and comfort remain unaffected. Your comments clearly show we fell short in a few areas, and we are actively addressing each point you mentioned — from improving room cleanliness and maintenance checks to reducing wait times in our restaurant and ensuring better in-room amenities.

We also appreciate your helpful suggestions regarding seating, waste bins, and the presence of dogs on the property. These are all being reviewed seriously as part of our efforts to create a better experience for all guests.

Please know that your feedback has been shared with the relevant departments and our management team is taking steps to ensure these issues are corrected moving forward.

We regret that your stay did not reflect the high standards we aim to provide, and we thank you for bringing these matters to our attention. We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future and offer you a much-improved experience.

Warm regards,

","Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","4","Cleanliness","2","Service","1","Sleep Quality","3","Very disappointing experience. 
Despite all the negative reviews on Anantaya resort passikuda in booking.com and other places, we decided to stay at anataya thinking it can’t be that bad. It truly was a bad experience. Because March is off season, the resort has put all the training staff in place . While this is completely okay, the management should make sure the service and the environment is still upto standard. For the price we paid, we expected a certain standard but we faced number of unpleasant experiences. below are few which sounds small but caused delays and inconvenience 

NEGATIVES 
- the rooms weren’t that clean 
- coffee was unavailable in the room and had to call few times to get some 
- the locker in one of the rooms wasn’t working. After calling number of times, someone came to fix it but couldn’t fix and gave up. 
- phone in one of the rooms wasn’t working properly to request room service or content the reception 
- the delux room we got didn’t have any chairs to sit outside. 
- balconies were dirty
- we ordered lunch and waited for over one hour for the food to be delivered. We were told the training staff was cooking and that’s why. This was unacceptable. 

In addition, the food was not tasty 

POSITIVES 
- beach and the pool was nice 

FEW RECOMMENDATIONS 
- lots of dogs inside the resort near the pool area. Always fights and barks at each other. While dogs lovers are okay with this, not all visitors like this. It creates a bad atmosphere to the hotel. 
- would be nice to have more bins in the room 
- food quality and standard couldn’t improve 
- restaurant needs to be more efficient 
- should put some chairs on ground floor outside to sit on. Without chairs, that area is useless 
- make sure tea, coffee and sugar is fully restocked 

Unless management takes time to consider these points and make an important, unfortunately I cannot recommend anantaya to others.","Unpleasant experience.

Yes, the hotel is a bit outdated and in places you can see it, but that's a trifle. There is no typical European 5* hotel in Sri Lanka.
We were also in the hotels next door. And we were convinced that this is the coziest, greenest and most beautiful. The minus is that the SPA is under renovation, but that was a trifle.

This was our 5th stay at Ananthaya Pasikudah and our 17th visit to Pasikudah—we absolutely love the beach!

One of the main reasons we keep returning is the exceptional service. The staff truly make a difference, and we have to mention Lahiru, the restaurant captain. If you’re visiting with kids, be sure to speak to him—he goes out of his way to ensure everything is perfect. Our kids adore him and the entire team! If you ever have any issues with food or service, Lahiru is the person to talk to—he will make your holiday even more special. Since meeting him, we’ve been coming back every four months!

We always book the pool access room, which is ideal for families. The kids love having easy access to the pool, making their stay even more enjoyable.

Another must-do when staying here is the morning beach walk. It’s the best time to see the fish and watch the fishing boats bringing in their fresh catch—a truly peaceful and beautiful experience.

A huge thanks to Ranika, the General Manager, who is always available to help with anything. His personal touch and commitment to guests make a big difference.

If you're looking for a relaxing, family-friendly beach getaway with excellent hospitality, Ananthaya Pasikudah is the place to be! We can’t wait for our next visit.","A Home Away from Home – Our Favorite Beach Getaway!","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r999527582-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","6","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager43180234378","Voyager43180234378","A032FDBCC10350ECFD17341329F159FE",,,,,"Voyager43180234378"

Needs Improvement: The buffet selection was lacking given the price and star rating of the property. The team does try but they just don't have a premium offering and its really disappointing. The buffer is sparse for options and lacks a 5 star / premium feel. Hands down the worst spread I've seen of any 5 star hotel across the island. The beach towels offered by the property are REALLY bad, almost rags felt awful drying ourselves off with them.  

Good: The pool is quite spacious. The rooms are also spacious but we had a few minor issues: plug points not working, water ponding in the shower etc. Overall they need better maintainence and upkeep. 

Excellent: The airconditioning in the room is excellent. Its powerful and cold. The staff are generally very pleasant but they're in a complete cost cutting mode and they're trying to spend the least, price the most with the hopes that guests will be OK with what's offered. 

Overall, I would choose Maalu Maalu, Amaya Beacg, Uga Beach or Calm before you consider this property! It should be your last resort all things equal.","Not at all a 5 star experience.

Die Umgebung ist ländlich, die Lebensbedingungen einfach, Verkehrsmittel vorallem Tuk Tuk oder klimatisiertes Taxi möglich. Das Hotel bietet ebenfalls Touren an, auch Elefantensafaris.Wenn man mit dem Tuk Tuk unterwegs ist, erfährt man viel vom Alltagsleben der Einheimischen. Discos und Unterhaltung auswärts und dergleichen gibt es nicht. Es hat in der Nähe ein Fischrestaurant, das haben wir nie besucht haben. Im Hotel gibt es 2x pro Woche leichte Unterhaltungsmusik, ansonsten ist es sehr ruhig, was wir ausserordentlich geschätzt haben. Man hört das Meer rauschen und die Vögel zwitschern.

Территория отеля нам понравилась гораздо больше, чем у соседних. Очень аутентично, уютно и чисто. Нас пугали, что в это время на этом побережье не сезон, но погода была просто шикарной! Мы даже обгорели в первый же день, поэтому настоятельно рекомендуем пользоваться солнцезащитным кремом с высоким SPF.

Пляж – супер! Персонал всегда принесут матрасы для лежаков и полотенца, передвинут лежак, если нужно – сервис на высшем уровне.

Учтите, что на этой стороне шри сезон с мая по октябрь, поэтому в основном облачно, на океане всегда красный флаг и волны.

Сам пляж песочный, мелкий и длинный. Поскольку он муниципальный, все лежали отеля расположены на территории, но идти до воды прям совсем чуток.

Сама территория очень зеленая и ухоженная.

Персонал в основном говорит на не очень понятном английском, однако какие-то базовые слова понимает. В случае не понимания зовут других официантов/барменов на помощь)

Еда отличная, переживали что все будет острое, однако никаких проблем не возникло. Много морепродуктов, фрукты каждый день.

Отдыхали на алл инклюзив, поэтому за территорию отеля в целом не выходили.

Better to take foods from outside",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ananthaya Resort in Pasikudah truly feels like a slice of heaven. The stunning architecture and beautifully designed rooms make it a standout destination. The pool suites are particularly remarkable, offering a luxurious and serene experience. The main pool area is breathtaking, with an ambiance that might remind you of Bali, creating an ideal spot for relaxation and picturesque moments.

The service was exceptional, with staff who were attentive and welcoming throughout our stay. However, the food was a major letdown. For a high-end hotel of this caliber, the buffet offerings were below average and did not meet expectations. While everything else at the resort was perfect, the dining experience was disappointing.

If you’re visiting Ananthaya Resort, it’s best to plan for meals outside the property. Despite the food issue, this place is a must-visit for its incredible atmosphere, architecture, and top-tier hospitality. A little improvement in the dining department would make it flawless.","Sri Lankan Bali","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r989583124-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"2730","776187624","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/43/ae/e8/caption.jpg","2728","0","44","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550blackw","Dr. Lakshan Kalupahana","E4E69106FDF4293F8FC458A7A33D5C29",,"1865780","Matale, Sri Lanka","Matale","550blackw"

From the restaurant captain and his assistant to the chef and F&B manager, everyone went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. They constantly checked in with us to see if we had any issues or needed anything extra, responding swiftly to all our requests. Being a picky eater, I was impressed by how they adapted the set menu to suit my preferences, even preparing special dishes for me during the buffet.

We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday, and they made it truly memorable by offering us a complimentary cake with candles and beautiful bed decorations.

The entire booking process was seamless, done online through email, with prompt replies to all my queries.

The location is fantastic compared to other hotels in the area, and the large swimming pool with a pool bar adds great value to the experience. The rooms were spacious with a calming lighting setup, which made our stay even more enjoyable.

It looks well designed and appealing but really lets itself down. 
Firstly I don’t know if they have problems with guests not paying but having to sign for drinks ( a bottle of water!) before it even arrives at the start of a meal - our first restaurant experience - was unusual. Being asked pretty much every mealtime over a  3 day stay which room we were in ( ok but there were only about 10 guests as it was end of season) equally surprising. 
Food was pretty poor - we ended up complaining to the chief of waiting staff so the chefs were then brought  out so we could repeat ourselves snd they could apologise. 
There are large areas of the hotel ( seafood restaurant clearly visible from the only restaurant) which staff admit haven’t been open in literally years, all of which gives a feeling of desertion and lack of investment. 
The restaurant staff as a whole all seem pretty inexperienced - certainly very different to the other 7 hotels we stayed in over our 17 day holiday. 
Overall we had a fantastic trip to Sri Lanka and would definitely come back,  but this was a low point - we should’ve gone to Uga bay further down the coast.","A low point of holiday","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r972739294-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452391908","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg","1200","46","37","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivianonholiday","vivianonholiday","421B8079176AE55D197398E759A6C99D",,"186411","Leeds, United Kingdom","Leeds","vivianonholiday"

Since GM Fowme Ibrahim took over it's been absolutely fantastic. I can personally attest to the excellence and changes he brought to this hotel. Being a World traveler across all six continents on a regular basis, Trinco blu by Cinnamon has always exceeded my expectation. Specifically since Fowme became the GM. 
At checkin there were so many people waiting to get checked in, but I was amazed the way they welcomed people and made them feel like at home. Shobana was great in welcoming me and also Naturalist Gamini went out of his way to make the process smooth and efficient. And he kept checking on me even at the dining areas. This was simply beyond 5**** plus. Chef Viraj personally greeted me and was willing to help me have a great culinary experience. Out of all the meals I certainly enjoyed breakfast the most, because there so many healthy options so well prepared. I really enjoyed the manioc with chicken curry lunu miris, Katta Sambol with boiled eggs, which was deliciously prepared by the chef. The breeze from the beach and the top quality service from Nesithma whom I found so passionate about people and she served with great joy and care. She really stood out as genuine server along with Sandeepa, Saseevan jayanthan and Siva who were top class in the area of hospitality and service. Also Sythari the guest relations manager was very attentive in promptly getting me checked in and making sure that my stay was super good","Outstanding service and the best stay","2025-06","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1015494731-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","87","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firelightersglobal","A Perera","68B5FD35B1600FAD351FFFCDDE9E931C",,,,,"firelightersglobal"

Shehani on reception was fabulous.  We were early so they couldn't give us all rooms and she was so apologetic; we were able to have access to one room and then discovered we were upgraded to chalets which was just amazing. Shehani checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was okay - which it was.  The rooms were fabulous and looked over the beach; there was a tap outside each room so you could wash your feet before entering; fabulous bathroom and linen; small fridge in the room; outdoor seating area including a day bed. The pool was beautiful; staff out of this world; breakfast and dinner....omg! There were so many choices.  Take the time to talk with the staff and you will be rewarded with beautiful smiles and recognition whenever you see them - and that applies to all areas including the security team and gardeners.  We were very sad to leave after such a beautiful experience.","Five star all the way","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1011423200-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","180","344","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famadven","famadven","B05B86A31D24F1929BC2170C07444A0B",,"255115","Wellington, New Zealand","Wellington","famadven"

Thank you for sharing such a detailed and heartfelt review of your second stay with us at Hilton Yala Resort. It was truly our pleasure to welcome you back, and we are thrilled that your experience was just as memorable as the first.

Your kind words about our property, team, and culinary offerings warm our hearts. Chef Tissera and Sous Chef Majid will be overjoyed to know their efforts made such a positive impact on your stay—going the extra mile to source lake prawns for you was their absolute pleasure, and it reflects the passion they have for creating unforgettable dining experiences.

I’m also delighted to hear that our General Manager, Gitanjali, and Indika made your stay even more special by ensuring every detail was handled with care. At Hilton Yala, we truly believe in going above and beyond for our guests, and it’s wonderful to see that this philosophy resonated with you.

Thank you for recognizing our team's commitment and for being part of our journey as Hilton expands across the island. We can’t wait to welcome you back for your third visit and create even more cherished memories together.

Clearly one of the best resorts in Sri Lanka the only one of a kind high end resort attached to an international brand like Hilton. This is a beautifully designed high end property located in the YALA national park buffer zone. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. In this resort the executive chef Tissera had a carefully crafted menu which appealed to our palate whilst retaining the identity of Sri Lankan food. He and the sous chef Majid were very gracious to source lake prawns as it was my desire to eat this dish before leaving the island and they went over and beyond to source it for us. NO was not in the vocabulary at this hotel and chef Tissera was no exception. It is nice to see more Hilton properties pop in the island.A special mention about the GM Githanjalee who personally intervened to  ensure we had a pleasant stay. Special mention of Indika who was extremely pleasant and went over beyond to accommodate us. Overall an excellent stay with pleasant memories and will look forward to our next visit.","Niche product southern Sri Lanka worth a","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r988408231-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452388139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","1","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellywW8477TY","Shelly W","61DAE87F9F99DAD0CCD2F864709482DC",,"48503","Rochester, New York","Rochester","shellywW8477TY"

Thank you so much for your heartfelt and detailed review. It was an absolute pleasure having you and your husband stay with us at Hilton Yala for your much-needed nature escape.

I’m truly touched by your kind words about our team and the personalized care you experienced throughout your stay. It was wonderful to meet you both and ensure your check-in and upgraded villa set the tone for an unforgettable week. I’ll be sure to pass along your lovely feedback to Asela, Tharidu, and Kasun—they’ll be thrilled to know their efforts made such an impression on you.

I’m delighted that you enjoyed the thoughtful amenities, sustainable practices, and exclusive atmosphere of the resort. Your appreciation for the safari experience means the world to us. I’ll share your kind words with Pazindu and Thushara, who take immense pride in creating memorable, respectful, and immersive adventures. Knowing that you felt safe, informed, and connected with Sri Lanka’s stunning wildlife is a testament to their passion and dedication.

Chef Jerome and his culinary team will be overjoyed to hear how much you relished their creations. Taking your preferences into account and creating dishes that leave lasting memories is their true passion. It’s wonderful to hear that the bush banquet was a highlight—it’s indeed a magical experience that we love sharing with our guests.

We also appreciate your feedback about Netflix and will certainly explore ways to enhance the in-room experience.

On behalf of the entire team, thank you for letting us be part of your incredible journey. We’re so grateful to have had the opportunity to make you feel like family and hope to welcome you back for another spectacular stay in the future.

We can’t properly express our immense gratitude for the Yala Resort team and the incredible treatment that made our trip spectacular. 

I’m a very detailed planner, and had no idea how absolutely inclusive and five star this property was until we arrived. The check in process was so breezy with a gorgeous upgraded villa, and the staff gave us such a warm welcome overseen by an obvious pro, Vino, the front desk manager. Asela always had a buggy ready to take us to our room and always ensured we were having whatever we needed for our stay - his smile was infectious!

Our villa had a private pool in the jungle with the ocean in the background and had every thoughtful amenity you could imagine. The property is only a year old so it is perfectly clean and divine. Beautiful lighting, makeup mirrors, a deep soaking tub, a pillow menu for whatever your needs require, umbrellas, and technology for anything you need. Cushy towels, nice robes, slippers, flip flops, bath salts, and the most expensive and technologically advanced toilet I’ve ever seen. Our housekeeping staff, Tharidu and Kasun were genuinely wanting to ensure we had everything we needed everyday and kept our room spotless and comfy all day long. The property is also plastic free which we absolutely loved and respected. Even the room keys are wood and they are leading the way with sustainability efforts. The resort pool is gorgeous and plenty of room for privacy, especially since there’s only 42 rooms here. Very exclusive vibe and personalized service. 

We pre booked 6 days worth of safaris and were lucky enough to be with our expert guide, Pazindu, and safari driving expert, Thushara every day. Getting to know these guys and know we were in good hands made us feel safe and excited to learn about Sri Lankan culture nature every day. It was really important to us to respect nature and the environment instead of the normal side of the road guys racing through the park to get a good look at whatever was there. These guys took us to remote areas, found us beautiful birds, rare sightings, elephants, leopards, and jackals and ensured we even picked up local spot experts who knew even more- to share facts, conservation work, and migration patterns of the birds that they were thrilled to see alongside us. Instead of a driver just taking you for a ride - you have a driver and a personal guide sitting with you to spot animals and take pictures for you so you can just enjoy the experience and live in the moment. They had rain jackets, coconut water, more snacks than you could ever need, and bincoulars - you literally don’t need to bring anything. We did a beach walk, dune walk, Block 1, 5, 6, Bundala Park, and Sithulpawwa. All so beautiful and different ways to see and experience culture and nature. 

The icing on the cake was Chef Jerome and his staff in the kitchen. Some of the absolute best food we’ve had in years. Beautiful presentations, local ingredients, and flavors that remind you how food should taste. He encouraged us to order off menu and took our requests and preferences into consideration when making us personalized meals. We’re so lucky to have eaten his food for a week and we’ll be chasing those flavors forever. Chanaka, Dilanka, and Indika made our meals special with fantastic service and genuine interest in making sure we had a great experience. One of the days we booked the full day safari with bush banquet - although expensive it is absolutely worth every penny - Hiran and the entire team cooked us the best meal in the middle of a jungle. It’s a must do! 

There’s nothing I would change about this property (except maybe Netflix streaming on the tv since i normally fall asleep to old favorite shows). Truly a spectacular once in a lifetime experience to feel so welcomed by this team - THANK YOU everyone who made us feel like family.","Spectacular In Every Way","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d26194654-r985649450-Hilton_Yala_Resort-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1354","732487773","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/a8/e0/5d/caption.jpg","1354","39","219","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beana525","Sabrina L","677DE768A6BD0DCCC2DC11AA142F7208",,"294013","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Abu Dhabi","beana525"

Observations 
Staff were quite ok, wth few outstanding ones.

Despite also holding Gold status with Marriott and Platinum Ambassador status with IHG, Hilton has always been my preferred brand—until my recent experience at Hilton Colombo, which was by far the worst treatment I have ever received at check-in.

While the door staff, bell desk, and restaurant teams were courteous and efficient, the Front Office Manager, Natal, was shockingly rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. He refused to acknowledge my Honors status and denied any upgrades or benefits, falsely claiming that because I hadn’t booked through the Honors app, I wasn’t entitled to them. This is simply not true, as I have accumulated 540K+ Honors points through extensive Hilton stays.

Even more concerning, when I questioned this, he stated that all guests are treated the same, regardless of loyalty status. This completely disregards Hilton’s commitment to rewarding its most loyal customers. Loyalty programs exist to recognize and appreciate returning guests, not to treat them like any random walk-in.

Due to this appalling service, we canceled our five-night reservation and moved to Colombo Marriott—where the experience was a complete contrast. Marriott immediately recognized my Elite Gold status, offered lounge access, extra points, complimentary cocktails, and high tea throughout our stay. On top of that, the rate was $50 lower than Hilton, and the hotel itself was far more modern and well-maintained.

I strongly advise all Hilton Honors members to avoid Hilton Colombo until they address the rudeness and lack of customer service at their front desk. Multiple reviews highlight similar issues, and it’s clear that Natal is not suited for any customer-facing role.

Moving forward, we will not return to Hilton Colombo and will shift all personal and corporate stays to Colombo Marriott, where loyalty is genuinely valued.","Worst Check In Experience and rude Front Office Manager in anywhere in the world","2025-03","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d306379-r996732660-Hilton_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452387615","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","1200","26","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanakaK_13","Chanaka K","E62E055F34FCE189BFAD8B69F3AA7769",,"255347","Bendigo, Australia","Bendigo","ChanakaK_13"

Honestly, for the location and experience, the resort is seriously underpriced – great value for money.

The best part of the trip was the waterfall trek. The guides were amazing – really kind, made sure everyone was safe, and took us through the jungle, over rocks, and right to the waterfall where we could explore and have fun. It was the perfect mix of adventure and nature.

However, when we were about just one hour to the property. The receptionist notified us that the cable car is broken and that we have to take the treacherous walk to the property from the car park. And that we were not advised to walk back after drinks at night after the visit to Ella town. They offered no other alternative. Finally after an expensive journey in a Kangaroo chauffer driven car, we were stranded without a place to stay. Thankfully we found accommodation in the best property in Ella. 
The Millon dollar question is..
1). If the cable car broke down aearly morning. Why didn't the property inform us about the breakdown before we left Colombo at 11 am? 
2). I have been trying to call the property for three days before the booking. No one answered the phone. 
3). The receptionist Mr Lalith Dissanayake mentioned that the property belongs to the Ravana Valley Group and that the Reservations Manager Mr. Chaminda Prasad requested us (the client) to call him to discuss cancellation. I insisted that he call me. That call never came. And Lalith promised that the booking will be cancelled without debittimg my credit card on Chaminda's orders. However this was not confirmed. Action is pending.

What a fabulous jungle resort! Ella Jungle Resort is truly one-of-a-kind — a perfect blend of adventure, comfort, and nature. The entire experience was absolutely mind-blowing. The rooms are rustic yet elegant, and bathrooms were basic but big. Beds are comfortable, and to our surprise, not a single mosquito in sight — a jungle miracle!

The staff deserves a special mention — always prompt, courteous, and ready to help with a smile. The food was delicious and satisfying, perfect after a long day of exploring.

Getting to the resort itself is an adventure — a bumpy dirt road followed by a thrilling ropeway ride sets the tone for an unforgettable stay. Don’t miss the waterfall trek and the zip line — both are exhilarating and give you a true taste of the wild.

Highly recommend this hidden treasure for anyone looking to disconnect and soak in the beauty of Sri Lanka’s jungles.","Fabulous jungle resort!!!

However the rooms are are badly designed with poor lighting and amenities.  For the price charged this was a clear rip-off.  Visible signs of poor maintenance and hygiene.  Bathrooms are equally badly designed with no planning as well with low pressure of water.

Food quality was equally bad with small portions and lack of taste

But then the hotel closed possibly due to Covid and renovations and they were closed for a long time. After they opened,  we tried to contact them in all ways possible (telephone call, SMS, email, WhatsApp) to get a refund (as it was not our fault that the hotel couldn't honor the booking), and this went on for months. They would say they would check and get back but never did. Obviously, as we don't go to Ella that often, we just left it at that and waited to hear from them. We did send an occasional reminder though. Now, as we got a chance to go to Ella, we asked if they could let us use that advance. I got very blunt and rude replies saying that as the managing company has changed they can't do anything. Didn't even try to contact the previous company to see the possibility of getting our money back. Didn't even try to see this issue from the customer's perspective. Are customers responsible for management company changes? Don't they inherit the accounts from the previous company? Aren't they bound to honor bookings made by the previous people? Shouldn't they at least try to see from the customer's side and have the decency to send courteous replies? This was the last rude reply I got on WhatsApp  ""It's our responsibility to pay you which you made payment to another company 2020? You have to solve the issue at the same time. We are sorry and we can not do anything  with your payment. Pls don't text us regarding this anymore"".  The company name seems to be Ravana Valley Pvt Ltd.

The exhaustion of 2024 sat heavy on my shoulders, while my WhatsApp pinged like tiny arrows of obligation against my consciousness. ""Are you free for a quick call?"" they chirped, each message a small paper cut to my already fraying nerves.

Then came the room mix-up. Oh, how gloriously I rose to that occasion! Like a seasoned performer, I unleashed the full symphony of urban indignation – complete with huffs, puffs, and the kind of entitled demands that make me cringe in retrospect. The staff's response? Pure grace. They met my disproportionate city rage with such gentle competence and genuine accountability that I felt my carefully constructed wall of irritation crumble into something resembling shame.

But here's the thing about Ella Jungle Resort – it doesn't judge. Instead, this hidden mountain valley simply wraps itself around you like a warm embrace from an old friend who knows exactly what you need. The cold mountain streams don't just cleanse; they perform a kind of spiritual cryotherapy, freezing those petty thoughts mid-formation until they shatter and float away with the current.

Let's be clear: if you're looking for the kind of place where thread counts matter more than authentic experience, this might not be your cup of Ceylon tea. For real – you're in the middle of the jungle, so yes, you'll have the occasional uninvited six-legged guest. But the rooms come with all the essentials: AC (though we never used it – the mountain air kept things perfectly cool, even requiring a blanket at night), fans, and reliable hot water. It's that sweet spot between wild and comfortable. If you are particular and need things to be just so, or you are in a mood, you may find a few things wanting - the upside is that all these things are on management's must-do-better list, and they seem genuinely determined. 

The magic here isn't in the amenities (though they're perfectly adequate) – every room overlooks the river that circles this 150-acre property. You dine under the stars around a campfire at night, and as peacocks dance in the old paddy field, and the cool mountain air blows in, you find yourself breathing more deeply and more gloriously than you have in months...possibly even years. It's in the way the land calls you and in the knowing smiles of the staff who've seen countless others like you slowly unfurl from their urban chrysalis, in the profound silence that fills the spaces between your thoughts.

And then there's the adventure. Here I am, a permanently anxious and constantly raging 46-year-old whose last meaningful relationship with fitness ended somewhere between Chemical Brothers and last orders at The Electric Ballroom circa 2004, soaring through the jungle canopy on a zipline. The old me would have crafted a dozen excuses, but something about this place makes you brave. Perhaps it's because the mountain air has already worked its magic, or maybe it's because you've remembered that life isn't meant to be lived through a screen and endless obligations in the rearview mirror – it's meant to be lived in moments of exhilarating, heart-pounding joy.

I came here season-weary and review-jaded; I left with my soul humming in harmony with the mountains. To those whose spirits are running on empty, whose minds are cluttered with the debris of modern life, whose hearts have forgotten the simple joy of just being – this place isn't just a resort - It's a reminder of who you were before the world told you to be busy all the time.

Come to Ella Jungle Resort not for what it is, but for what it allows you to become. Stay as long as your schedule permits, though be warned – you might find yourself renegotiating what ""schedule"" means after a few days here. And if you're reading this while simultaneously checking your work emails (I see you), book it now. Your future self, the one with quieter thoughts, softer edges, and perhaps a surprising taste for adventure, will thank you.

P.S. To the staff who handled my room-mix-up meltdown with such grace – I'm still sorry, and also deeply grateful. You were the first crack in my armor, and that's exactly what I needed.","Checked in with my phone - checked out with my soul.","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r987803950-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlynaO1","Alyna O","23BECE0A57072A4293B3D7B64D0D1965",,,,,"AlynaO1"

If you expect a grand buffet like in a beach 5 star hotel or Colombo city hotel this is not the place. But if you like plated service with organic and Sri Lankan food this place is just ideal.

Big no. 
First of all, before booking, please go through all these comments. Look at the pictures. Not posted by the property but from guest. The place have a great potential but as of today it is just a scam. Place is undeveloped, rooms are nasty. Food terrible. All three above aspects can be fixed easily and reading that this ""in a jungle"" makes no sense. We travel to Sri Lanka often, staying in boutique hotels but also in a real jungle. All places can be clean and nice disputing the fact of not easy environment around. Same w/ food. Staying ""in a jungle"" explain nasty food served? Having so many option for low-key or upscale Sri Lanka' culinary possibilities? 

So we did claim many times issues on site. Zero interest. Management's reaction: it is what it is, deal with it. 
Immediate decision to leave. After one night in dirty room and without even touching a breakfast. 

Now it gets more interesting.. When I wanted to set a review on booking.com it turned that ... we have not stayed there. Ella Jungle Resort just canceled our stay, after the payment was taken. Now I understand the GM laugh on the phone and the answer ""good luck with the reviews, hahahah"". 

This is so fUp that such terribly managed places w/ the attitude as they have presented, in such beautiful country are making trips for tourists so unpleasant. I love Sri Lanka. We'll be back regardless. But I hope bs spots will despair from the accommodation map sooner than later.

Random pictures and management actions (then and now) should say more than this entire review.","Terrible experience. Waste of time, money and nerves.

Best thing is the staff they treats you like king and makes you feel very special. very friendly and always ready to do whatever you ask. no is something I didn't hear.

my 9 year old son enjoyed the activities also and last bath at river stream is most rejenuvating in our entire srilankan trip.

Ella jungle resort gave us and everyone present the worst possible experience. 
First of all the location and the nature is very beautiful. I am sad to say it’s in wrong hands. On arrival the room condition was very bad. 
1. Toilet comods not cleaned 
2. Ant infestation everywhere 
3. No water supply 
4. Definitely no hot water 
5. No AC to all the rooms 
6. Towels wet 

Anyways we somehow managed and tried take a wash with the little water we got and go have dinner. 
At this point, we were super hungry following the tiring ride to the resort from the main road. 
But most of the items were over or almost over. Initially there was a few devilled chicken left. Once asked to restock it they brought devilled prawns and not chicken ( that also after a very long time) for a meat dish it was only the devilled prawns after that. For people with seafood allergy just eat the rice only?  because other dishes were also empty.  There was ice cream but no bowls to eat. 
Plates, cutleries, cups were not washed properly and there is no one at the buffet to check and restock the finishing plates, cutleries and food. No one nearby area to call also. Under the plates full of oil and noodle pieces on top of the plate  as they were not washed properly. 
We had to go to the buffet and keep on standing until we got something to eat. When we got something to eat we had to then stand waiting for plates. 

Since we had to experience this at the start we already made a complaint through whatsapp to the one who was taking the bookings. So that they will correct themselves and the next breakfast , lunch and the next day will be treated properly for the price we paid to get the so called 3 star hotel experience as mentioned by them. 
The reply I got from the operator was… “NOT allowed to have bites in buffet” 
So, i said yea no need to have bites in buffet if we can have dinner that’s enough. 
So the hotel team has informed her that some people are having bites from the buffet that is why this whole problem raised.
She never apologised or corrected the issue. 
Some other person not having bites is not the solution for all the problems I mentioned above. Even if they had bites, there is a limit a person can eat and for the money they took they are responsible enough to provide us with enough food specially when we were away from the main road. 
The full amount was already paid to confirm the booking. 
As all the guests couldn’t bear the frustration they tried to talk to the two so called managers called Isuru and Ajith. 
They too never apologised or tried to correct themselves. They are saying that the problem is this going under the name as hotel. This should be an adventure zone it seems. If this is an adventure zone, they cannot be charging such high prices and even if this is an adventure zone they cannot keep the guests starving like how we did for the dinner. Ajith is also saying that for one day become vegetarian and enjoy. If you expect the guests to eat vegetarian for the price they paid please add more vegetarian dishes without letting them eat only rice. 
Mr. Ajith’s behaviour is definitely not suitable for a manager over there. He doesn’t know how to behave. He is always trying to rule the guests and try to be the boss like an army commander over there. May be because the owner of the place is a commander? Under the term of hotel hospitality you cannot rule the guests and talk to them in rough tone and command them over things. The isuru the other manager is saying he will send all the staff home tomorrow because the issue to this problem is the innocent ground staff. 
From what I heard soon after an incident like this happens what they do is chase away the ground staff without even paying them their salary as if they are responsible for what happened. Yes the staff over there is not skilled enough for a three star resort. If you charge such amounts and advertise your business in such a way please also spend appropriately to give the best possible service, food and experience for the guests without being only profit oriented. Upon departure we had to wait for hours sleeping on the lobby until the cable car + jeep took us to the main road. They didn’t even let us stay on the room until their lorry is ready. On arrival we got a safari jeep but for departure we got a lorry. 
They do so much cost cutting here. 
They do not think about the time and value of it on guests. We had to leave with so much frustration and hunger. Soon after leaving the first thing we did was to go to the most nearest pol roti shop and eat. Where we got so tasty food and our stomaches got full. For everything I have mentioned I have evidence from screenshots, recordings and video clips. I hope they correct themselves because the nature over there is nice. 
But, I have also experienced similarly or even better more beautiful natural places for a lower budget and with great food and service. First of all the owner of this place should correct himself. I hope Ella Jungle Resort will soon correct themselves from cheating the guests. For everyone who is planning to go there, please think twice.","Frustrated","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r971103218-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","0","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amaya-FO3","Amaya","9027E00E780DCD736883F95FAAFE2020",,,,,"Amaya-FO3"

Our recent stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing, despite its fantastic location. The initial impression was positive, especially with the cable car experience, but everything went downhill once we entered our room.

Upon arrival, we found two used towels on the bed, which was quite unsettling. We requested fresh towels, but even then, there was no hot water available, making it impossible to enjoy a warm shower in the freezing cold. To add to our frustration, the room lacked basic amenities such as tissues—there was only an empty tissue box.

The cleanliness of the room was another major issue. The bed was covered in dirt and dead ants, forcing us to do our own housekeeping. This is simply unacceptable. To top it all off, dinner was terrible, making the entire experience even more regrettable.

It’s clear that the staff responsible for maintaining the property are not taking their duties seriously. This lack of responsibility and attention to detail left us with a negative impression of what could have been a great stay.","Disappointing Experience Despite Great Location","2024-08","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r965496200-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"1200","452391659","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","1200","1","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pula94","Pula","6A901FAF3E87B743F9DB2EF928E96618",,"1811027","Auckland, New Zealand","Auckland","Pula94"

We were not in a hurry but we have experienced generally how long it takes for a check in. ( front desk was not busy at that moment) at the check out also Shanika from front desk was unable to add points to my account and she messed up it with another room number which was under my name. i am not worrying about points or nothing against shanika, we had a wonderful experience as i mentioned. but these little little things should be focused on.","wonderful experience","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1010018845-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216lahiruc","Lahiru C","795667BE697D28945323B7E8D493E551",,,,,"216lahiruc"

The pool and beach have plenty of sun loungers but they're quite dated with peeling paint and some are losing their wheels. The hotel is really in need of some renovation and lacks the touches that could make it a really lovely hotel. The rooms are fine - big enough with plenty of storage - and fairly clean but our bathroom had patches of mould. The whole hotel felt like it needed a lick of paint and some nicer furniture. The view from the room was good though. 
The food was ok but the buffet seating area is bright and noisy so we didn't feel like it was a very relaxing experience. 
The receptionist who greeted us wasn't a great advert for the hotel either - he barely smiled a welcome, couldn't answer some basic questions, didn't explain anything and couldn't speak very good English. To be fair there were other staff members who were much more helpful - particularly when we wanted to visit the fort and he called us a tuktuk. 
I dont know if we were unlucky but the hotel was full of large groups when we went which meant long waits at the bar too. 
If you want to visit Tricomalee for a few days, this hotel is fine but it could be so much better. 
We would recommend walking down the beach to explore the other bars and cafes although some of them are really expensive.","Could be so much better","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1009332277-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"769","173157769","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/52/2d/89/akm515.jpg","769","39","158","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akm515","akm515","1AC7BF39E433DE63DB4CBA8FAD77E4AF",,"186419","Windsor, United Kingdom","Windsor","akm515"

The sea is wonderful. Please take your swimming kits, sunscreen etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed with the family, including me, my husband and 3 young kids - 5,6,9 years old. I stayed in this hotel once before at a standard room. Although all rooms have an ocean view, we opted to stay in beach bungalow. The room was very clean and comfortable with large balcony facing the sunrise. All amenities were available (hand made soap, body lotion with nice scent etc). The bed was very comfortable. I am a very choosy to pillows, but I was completely satisfied. Water in the room was replenished twice a day. 
As for the restaurant, I have never seen so many varieties of Sri Lankan dishes. We took FB meal since our kids are always hungry. The buffet has also included international dishes like chilli con carne, burgers, pasta carbonara). Deserts, fruit and cheese were really good. Cocktails in bar menu (“Cinnamon special”) surprised me much by their texture and unusual mixture of flavours.
The main speciality of the hotel is an incredible Maldives style beach with plenty of sunbeds and hammock hanging in the shade. The ocean was really calm. We were swimming and floating with the kids all day around. I recommend this hotel as a family friendly. 
I also enjoyed Balinese spa treatments in hotel spa. 
We had an individual trip by boat just from our beach to Pigeon Island. Hotel has a water sport center and diving school. We saw sharks and turtles at the national parks. It was an amazing trip.
All personnel were very kind and helpful and up to the standards of Cinnamon Hotel and Resorts network.","Great family vacation","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1008778017-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452389359","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","1200","23","64","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natalya_Silva","Natalya_Silva","EDB5945F874DB10199179ABF2387BB8A",,"4609920","Petrovo-Dalnee, Russia","Petrovo-Dalnee","Natalya_Silva"

Our stay at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel's design and top-notch amenities made for a truly relaxing and enjoyable experience.

The attentive and courteous staff catered to our every need, ensuring that our stay was as comfortable as possible.

* Guest Services Manager Sithari & her staff Rasangi gave us a warm welcome & always greeted us/ guests with a smile and a genuine interest in our/their well-being.

* Executive Chef Nishantha Viraj took time to greet us & made sure we had a great experience. The food was absolutely delicious - every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented & had a large range of different things from which you can choose & his staff works in harmony with the chef and their service is impeccable. Chef is extremely personable and seeks to match your wishes.

* Two ladies on the India-Sri Lankan live station Jasintha & Vijitha are hardworking & friendly. They both make the yummiest food.

* I'd want to thank Rajinthan for going above and beyond to ensure that our dining experience was exceptional. Also, Sameef, Niroshan & Mahesh's sincere welcome and excellent service made all the difference.

We recently stayed at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon and were impressed by the stunning location and serene ambiance. The room was spacious, luxurious, and impeccably clean, offering a peaceful retreat by the calm beach—an atmosphere we deeply appreciated.

However, our overall experience was marred by two significant issues.

1. Poor Food Quality:
The meals were very disappointing. Both dinner and breakfast lacked flavor and quality. While one cake at breakfast was passable, the rest were hard and dry. The string hoppers were particularly poor—dry, seemingly leftover, and not properly steamed. Dinner also failed to meet expectations, especially considering the reputation of the Cinnamon brand.

2. Unprofessional Checkout Experience:
We faced confusion during checkout regarding payment, despite having fully paid in advance through our travel agent. The front desk appeared unaware of this, leading to unnecessary delays. A staff member named Ms. Sidhara was especially unprofessional and rude, not only toward us but also to our guide. After the issue was resolved, we overheard her on a call saying, “release the guest,” which was deeply unsettling. It made us feel more like detainees than valued guests—language and behavior that are completely inappropriate in the hospitality industry.

In fact, we were supposed to extend our stay by one more day and had even started discussing it with our travel agent—but thank God we didn’t. Given the experience, we’re relieved we chose not to stay longer.

Having had positive experiences at other Cinnamon properties, this stay was particularly disappointing. We sincerely hope the management will address both the food quality and staff conduct to ensure a better experience for future guests.","Romantic Setting Ruined by Awful Food and Rude Staff","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1005454800-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452392461","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nivethap2025","Nivetha P","F9EF5972B97A84511953CFB6321F5A1E",,,,,"nivethap2025"

Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us. I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the distressing incident you encountered during your visit to our restaurant at NH Collection Colombo.

Your feedback is deeply concerning and certainly not reflective of the standards of professionalism, courtesy, and hospitality we expect from our team. I was both surprised and disappointed to learn of the way your concerns were handled by our Restaurant Manager, Mr. Ruwan. Please be assured that we take this matter extremely seriously.

We are currently conducting a formal internal review to understand exactly what transpired. Immediate steps have already been taken to ensure corrective action, including disciplinary procedures and mandatory retraining on guest relations and service recovery for the staff involved. We are also reviewing our buffet service protocols to ensure food temperature is monitored and maintained at all times.

On behalf of the entire team, I sincerely regret the embarrassment and discomfort this incident caused you. This is not the experience we wish to deliver to any of our guests, and I deeply regret that we fell short.

Should your travels bring you back to Colombo, I would welcome the opportunity to personally ensure your next experience reflects the high standards that define NH Collection. Please feel free to reach out to me directly should you wish to discuss this matter further.

Dear [Hotel/Restaurant Name] Management,

I am writing to formally lodge a serious complaint regarding an unacceptable incident that occurred during my recent visit to your restaurant. I was extremely disappointed and shocked by the behavior of your restaurant manager, Mr. Ruan, whose conduct was not only unprofessional but also deeply disrespectful.

During my meal, I noticed that the food being served at the buffet was consistently cold — not just one item, but every dish I sampled. As a paying guest, I felt it was well within reason to bring this matter to the staff’s attention, with the expectation that it would be addressed politely and professionally.

To my absolute dismay, when I raised this concern with Mr. Ruan, his immediate response was to raise his voice and shout at me in front of other guests. I remained calm and reminded him that this was not an appropriate way to speak to a customer. I asked him not to raise his voice and questioned if this kind of conduct reflected your hotel’s standards. Instead of correcting his behavior, he continued to argue and speak to me in an aggressive and disrespectful tone.

This escalation left me deeply embarrassed and uncomfortable. At one point, I had to ask him if I should leave my meal entirely or if he intended to continue his behavior — it was that confrontational. Eventually, your chef, Mr. Anuruddha, intervened and appropriately scolded Mr. Ruan for his behavior, at which point he finally left the scene.

While I appreciate Chef Anuruddha’s attempt to de-escalate the situation, the overall experience left a lasting negative impression on me. I came to your establishment expecting hospitality, not hostility.

I would like to ask:

What actions will be taken against Mr. Ruan for this incident?

What steps are being taken to ensure that no guest is treated like this in the future?

I strongly urge your management to provide immediate retraining or take disciplinary action against Mr. Ruan. No guest should ever be shouted at or humiliated for raising a legitimate concern — especially in a hospitality setting.

This incident has significantly impacted my view of your establishment, and I hope that you will take this matter seriously and respond accordingly.

Thank you so much for your heartwarming feedback and for celebrating Father’s Day with us at NH Collection Colombo!

We’re delighted to hear that you enjoyed the buffet spread, with its blend of global and local flavours, and that the elegant yet welcoming ambiance added to the occasion. It’s especially rewarding to know that our team — including Samadhi, Mr. Ashran Amith, and Krishani — made your experience even more special through their attentiveness and warmth.

We’re also thrilled that the cake-decorating competition and thoughtful giveaways helped create lasting memories. Celebrating Dads in such a meaningful way was truly our pleasure.

Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback following your recent stay with us.

We’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the beautiful view from your seaside room and appreciate you highlighting that aspect of your experience.

At the same time, we sincerely regret that our buffet did not fully cater to your dietary needs as a pure vegetarian. Your concern regarding dish labeling and the lack of allergen information is valid, and we are already working with our culinary team to ensure better clarity and distinction of items moving forward.

We also understand your discomfort with the bathroom layout and design. While the intention was to create a modern open-plan feel, we realize that it may not suit all guest preferences — especially when traveling with family. Your feedback is extremely helpful and will be shared with our design and operations teams for future improvements.

Thank you again for your comments. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and offer a more comfortable and personalized experience.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We’re sorry to hear that aspects of your stay didn’t meet your expectations.

Regarding the infinity pool, it is indeed exclusive to private suite guests, and we regret if this wasn’t clear from our online materials. Your feedback will help us improve the clarity of our communication.

We also apologize for any inconvenience caused by the main pool's shading and mosquitoes. We'll review our maintenance and pest control efforts to enhance the experience.

While we're glad you were satisfied with your room, we regret the late check-in and any inconsistencies in service. We’re addressing these issues to ensure a smoother experience for future guests.

We appreciate your review and hope you’ll consider visiting us again.

И мы совсем не понимали, что нас ждёт во время отдыха. Были парой в данном отеле с 15.07 по 22.07 2024 года (потом переехали в Хиккадуву).
Сначала о «плюсах» отеля.
Мы брали завтрак+ужин. Особенно запомнились ужины. По меню, каждый день разное, всё очень вкусное, мы очень наедались. 
В номере (у нас был №012) большая мягкая кровать. 
Напротив отеля располагался Кокосовый холм. Красиво встречать закаты, но там сильно многолюдно по вечерам.
Хороший бассейн. Частенько мы там плавали одни.
Около нашего балкона росло дерево, на котором каждый день бегали белочки (или бурундучки). Я каждый день за ними наблюдала.
Ланкийцы очень добрые. В отеле работники нам во всем помогали.
Теперь о «минусах».
Мирисса – это деревня. Делать там абсолютно нечего, достопримечательностей нет. Очень и очень скучно.
Тяжело будет тем, кто не знает английский язык. В Мириссе никто не знает русского языка. Нет вывесок на русском (как в Хиккадуве), нет турагентств на русском, нет русскоговорящих гидов на экскурсии).
Каждый день был красный флаг. Были большие волны. По итогу я ни разу не смогла войти в воду, это было очень опасно. 
Каждый день мы были на «черепашьем пляже», но так ни разу и не видели черепах (а я этот отель ради этого и выбирала). Зато милый черный песок около этого пляжа.
На скалу Попугаев попасть так и не смогли. Даже приходили до рассвета, когда отлив. Всё равно было воды по пояс. Но там течение и камни, я не рискнула перейти.
В отеле мало лежаков у бассейна, они почти всегда все бывают заняты.
В Мириссе, а и на всей Шри-Ланке нет тротуаров для пешеходов.  Совсем негде прогуляться. Транспорт носится как бешеный, гулять по дорогам небезопасно.
Отель находится прямо на дороге, поэтому очень шумно от проезжающего транспорта.  Тем более все там бибикают и сигналят с самого утра. Мы попали на день Полнолуния (они его отмечают 1 раз в каждый месяц), так их песнопения были очень громкие с утра и до ночи.
Нет никаких экзотических животных. А хотелось бы их видеть побольше, всё же Азия.
Негде сушить одежду. Сушилок нет.  Климат влажный. Сохнет одежда дня 2 или 3.
Почти каждый день было пасмурно, шли дожди. А так хотелось урвать и сфотографировать красивый закат. Один раз за неделю нам удалось запечатлеть закат.
Секретный пляж. Много о нём читалось, хотелось побывать.  Сели на тук-тук, туда с нас взяли 1500 рупий. Какое же там было разочарование. Купаться абсолютно негде. Воды по щиколотку, далее камни. Лежаки все от кафе. Делать там абсолютно нечего, не советую. Назад пошли пешком. В середине дороги свернули влево – там был рыбный порт. Вход для туристов всего 100 рупий с человека. Мы там вдоволь нагулялись. Красивые разноцветные лодочки, рыбаки грузят рыбу. Было интересно.
Собаки. И этим всё сказано. Их много, очень много. Везде. На улицах, на пляже. Все голодные, худые, в болячках и чешутся. И лают.
Как итог: для меня минусов оказалось больше, чем плюсов. Для себя сделала вывод, что Шри-Ланка – это «не моё место». Я всё сваливаю на то, что мы были в несезон и не на том побережье.","Приличный отель в деревне Мирисса","2024-07","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d12695896-r964481366-Triple_O_Six-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","1","91","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F155TD_","Юля К","DFB5C2C2C0C136AE22C6C708FDF6ECF6",,,,,"F155TD_"

We stayed here for three nights in the last week of March. Our room number was their namesake Triple O Six. Guessing it’s their best room. The ocean view from this room was fantastic. The bathroom was very spacious, with good fittings and had a jacuzzi facing the ocean.
The people manning the front desk were very helpful with info for planning our trips around Mirissa. The best part turned out to be their restaurant. We generally had an underwhelming experience with food in Mirissa. The wait times to get our orders were above an hour. Also, the restaurants nearby were highly rated but had small portion sizes or the quality was substandard for the cost. The online reviews for food options seem rigged based on our experience. The only exception was the delicious food we tried at Surfing Wombat and the long wait time here was bearable since our table had a great ocean view.
We decided to try the restaurant at Triple O Six. It is on the expensive side but far superior experience to other places in the vicinity. Better value for money, quantity and quality and importantly no hour-long wait time frustration for the food.
On the last day of our trip, we used the in-house pool. Clean well-maintained pool. Our positive experience was enhanced and we were thrilled to find an old-looking gold ring shining at the bottom. The reception told us that it looked quite valuable.
Overall, we had a good experience here.
The only con is that this place is not wheelchair friendly. There is a flight of stairs to the entrance of the reception. Saw a lady with knee issues struggling up those stairs and there was no alternate access.","A true gem","2024-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d12695896-r957623456-Triple_O_Six-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389216","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KashRa","KashRa","484B8208AADA3656E242212284865B7B",,"297628","Bengaluru, India","Bengaluru","KashRa"

Though its a little away from Mirissa Harbour and the town, but honestly its not at all a big deal.

The breakfast spread was quite good considering the limited rooms in the hotel. And the best part - a very very courteous staff. You feel wowed by their kind gestures and courtesy.

Protip: If you are really into white decors - try their Sugar suite, and if you are looking for Jacuzzi on the balcony - go for the Spice suite.

The hotel is a boutique hotel and a gem. From the time we checked in the staff were very hospitable and helpful. We checked in late but they sent us a snack to welcome us. 

Rooms and bathrooms are a good size and the suite is beautiful. Some rooms need a bit of maintenance (switch not working / toilet seat loose) but other wise very good. 

We had a whale watching tour in the morning before check out and requested a late check out. They gave us two rooms to keep late so we could freshen up before we left. Finally we did. It need to keep the rooms but it was a nice gesture. 

The hotel has a nice breakfast. Most of the group did not have breakfast but those that did said it was very good and service was good. 

Highly recommend this hotel in Mirissa. 👍 thank you to the staff.","A gem in Mirissa","2024-01","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d12695896-r934189699-Triple_O_Six-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"150","19594652","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2a/fd/9c/avatar.jpg","150","69","158","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RRBB11","RRBB11","F9C5A6B556A3AC173BBA667FD52C74DC",,"297604","Goa, India","Goa","RRBB11"

Comfortable beds, well equipped bathrooms .
Things that could be improved I think , are the breakfasts. The hotel isn’t really big enough to warrant a buffet. A lot of the items weren’t very warm and generally it was better when it was served a La carte. 
The bar closed very early , wasn’t possible to get a drink after 10.30pm and the room items in the fridge were poor ( no bottle opener provided) 
Staff were pleasant, but generally it was a little bit soulless

In spite of the new year, they still accepted my booking at the same ongoing rate (50,000/= B&B).
During our journey we didn’t get single follow-up call from them to check whether we were safely on the way, that shows how less they care us. After reaching their Café at the bend Restaurant, we tried calling the resort contact Gayan to say that we have come, but he didn’t answer the phone ontime. So we went around the café to see if there is a security officer to inform that we have reached, but the Security Officer seated inside the café and he was deaf, his hearing was so bad and we had to speak too loud so that he would hear and understand what we say. And he wasn’t a presentable, attentive, supportive and vigilant security officer. 
This shows how negligent and careless they are about their security despite the fact the owner of the Resort being a retired Major in the SL ARMY. 
We had to wait for an hour for their Toyota Hi-lux truck to come and pick us to the resort. It was raining, and the truck’s condition was very bad, its roof was damaged and had holes. 
After we reached, we were given a welcome drink, since we personally had some health concern over certain food we consume, we inquired about the ingredients of the fruit drink. The waiter didn’t know what he served us nor did he want to ask the Chef. 
We were escorted to our room, and we came to know there was no hot water shower. Being  located in a cool climate area. So we had to have a shower in the freezing cold water. During the whole night there were power drops, we were in the dark many times, they didn’t have a generator. 
We order dinner from the a la carte menu in 3hrs in advance, but the food came only around 10pm. They gave an excuse saying they were short of staff due to sinhala  new year. But why do they undertake bookings then ? if they are unable to serve food or provide service on time ? 
When we woke up next morning, we realized there was no water in the tap.  We couldn’t use the toilet and we had no way of pooping or urinating.  The management didn’t know that the guests didn’t have water. We tried to call them, but their phone was switched off, so we had to come out of our room and walk all the way to the front reception area looking for a person to complain. So we disappointedly returned back to our room and walked down to the water stream near the resort (Kirindi Oya) and bathed and peed as well in the stream. Such a gross, unpleasant experience ever faced in life in my whole travel life. Then few hours later manager came and said tap is broken, no maintenance staff, they are getting water from the stream, som mud stuck in the T-joint blah blah. So we had to believe whatever he said. We were served a so called English type but very basic breakfast for the price we paid, two slices of toasted white bread, 4 tiny sausages , magarine and jam and omelet with spinach. No Coffee, No Tea, No fruit platter, No brown bread, no meat…They didn’t serve us water, but they had mineral water bottles, the glasses were full of ants. 
We finished our breakfast around 10am, and was going to check-out, Then we realized their cable car was not working due to some mechanical or electrical issue in the tractor engine they use to operate the cables. There was no mechanic to fix it, finally an old person called to be the Chairman of this resort came there 1hr later and he was trying all his skill to fix it. Fire sparks were coming out of the battery terminals and the engine of the cable car machine. Being a mechanic I was 100% sure it has not gone through regular maintenance of battery check-up. They didn’t even have a tool kit to diagnose the issue. While we were waiting for more than 1.5hrs, a retired major guy came tried to lame attempt to pacify us by giving a 150/= 2 FANTA bottles to pacify our frustration. But we rejected it saying we need to check-out ASAP. As were already wasted our money, time and energy which was worth more than 150rupees, and was very late for our next appointment while we were filled with anger and frustration.  
Cable car didn’t seem to be working, we were scared even if it starts working what would happen if  it suddenly stops in the middle in the air while on travel. So we decided to carry all our heavy bags o the shoulders walked on the shaky wooden bridge with great difficulty by balancing our body with fear of our lives and crossed stream to the other side of the land. The walk wasn’t difficult to get to the top, we lost our way, and it was the most terrible unpleasant experience we faced with carrying heavy bags in our shoulders. We had no assurance that there would be a lorry waiting to take us back to the road as the Toyota Hilux what they use had gone to wellawaya town for some other work. So the resort people had to bring a lorry from outside to take us back to the road where our vehicles were parked near the ”Café at the Bend”.. 

MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,  PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. 
Management isn’t paying any attention to the guests or the facilities of the resort.

Positives:
- Thoroughly enjoyed the waterfall trek where we could jump into the waterfall and swim. The water was clean and the two ex-navy guides who came with us were very friendly and helpful. When I got stung by 2 wasps they were quick to clean my stings with antiseptic and provide some topical medicine. Obviously have a lot of knowledge about the jungle. 
- Surrounded by beautiful nature, in the evenings you can sit and read a book, while listening and watching the wild peacocks, cows grazing, duck waddling and other animals. 
- All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The young man who served us food was very polite and always trying to do his best. Also, we asked about improving the water pressure in our shower along with getting a fan for our room, and this was provided within the hour we asked. 
- Staff helped us book our bus ticket to Colombo. 
- Organised a bonfire for us in the evening which was very nice.

Negatives:
- The room. While the room initially looks aesthetic and in pictures looks beautiful, the actual practicality of the room is lacking. The top half of the room was totally open and you couldn't lock the glass doors on the balcony. Unfortunately this led to an extremely poor night sleep. We appreciate we are in the jungle, however the fear of monkeys, bats or anything else being able to enter our room easily was disconcerting especially with all the noises you can hear in the night. In addition, theres very little security in the resort so while it might be dramatic to say, with lack of service on the mobile, it can be a bit worrying to be sleeping with a glass door open to anyone who could enter. 
- Food was average - it was nice and personally I liked the vegetarian aspect as I eat a plant based diet. However, my partner did get a bad stomach after breakfast. 
- Not sure what bug, but woke up with many bites on my body, not mosquito but some kind of midge. So would be nice to have a mosquito plug. 
- No receptionist on arrival, she was only there on check-out which we felt was slightly unprofessional. 
- Also we asked if we needed to bring water bottles to which they told us they would provide water bottles. However, on check out we were charged around Rs. 1400 including tax for the water bottles we consumed. We literally would have brought our own had we known this.  
- Curtains had many holes in maybe from moths or rats. 

Overall, the staff really carried our stay and without them we would have left before the night. Higher management of the actual property needs to be dealt with, i.e. renovating the rooms. In addition, not worth the money you pay. It was the same price for us to stay here as cinnamon lodge hotel in habarana which is a 5 star hotel (with facilities such as buffet, swimming pool, in room dining, bicycles etc), and this resort does not live up to that standard.","Great staff but lacking higher management and not worth the money :(","2022-09","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r860182433-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"1231","633171654","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/bd/6e/c6/kate-t.jpg","1231","3","42","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateandjanaka","Kate T","82CF8F81A4B292D7507B9856908B411E",,"186216","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","kateandjanaka"

Our rooms were next to a bumbling stream, beautiful and so picturesque picturesque. The food we ate was all grown in the 280 acres. It’s 100% self sustainable. They grow all their rice and vegetables. They are 100% organic and make their own worm compost. As an avid Gardner I was fascinated and delighted to walk around the fields and observe all the fruit and vegetables.

There is no Wi-Fi in the cabins, it was the perfect opportunity to just relax and unwind. We had dinner under the stars with a roaring bonfire. This place has so much to offer. The staff was very attentive and kind. If you are a bird watcher, lots of birds to see. We saw a huge flock of the native Hornbill!","Magical experience","2022-07","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r847001731-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"1760","612934751","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/24/88/a4/5f/amandashafer.jpg","1760","0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaShafer","Amanda S","5C9AD53A7151AF191C7779570E57EAFF",,"56260","McKinney, Texas","McKinney","AmandaShafer"

The hotel and rooms are located in riverside and jungle environments. 

The food and beverages are organic, and most of them are vegetarian. Organic meals are delicious and ideal. They maintain large organic cultivation and a poultry farm to fulfill their vegetables etc supplies. There is an indigenous herbs cultivation that is done with the hope of renovating Ayurvedic medication. As they mentioned they wish to start an Ayurvedic medication center as their next project.

It was observed that some services were unable to be fulfilled because of side effects of Covid19 and the prevailing economic crisis, but we give a big tribute to staff continuing the resort at that level.

We had a great set of experiences that could not be taken from any other place.

Highly recommend it for nature lovers, adventurers, and calm seekers.

Our huge balcony/deck  sat  over the steam which you sleep with its soothing sound.  We were looking right at the jungle. Actually we were in jungle. All day we watched monkeys, birds, eagles and all sorts of wild life by sitting on our deck. 

But what is more important than its magnificent setting was their staff. We have never come across such unspoiled, friendly group of people before. Despite it is a professional establishment they treated us as if we were their family. We literally exchanged hugs and numbers when leaving. The food was  local organic vegetarian and amazing. The  ingredients  picked from Ella Jungle Resort’s own  farms. The Chef Wasante  who was also our favorite guy was  not only an amazing chef but also an amazing PR guy who made our stay memorable. Our guide Abi was very knowledgeable and sweet. He gave us free jungle tours to amazing waterfalls nearby. Manager Rowan was very helpful and friendly.  Literally we have experienced true Sri Lankan hospitality there, which is priceless.

Overall,  everyone should go there not for an amazing  jungle but also  for true Sri Lankan human experience.

COVID Guidelines
We were really surprised to find that the property did not follow proper COVID safety guidelines. There were no temperature checks done, there was no hand sanitizer offered, and no social distancing maintained at the buffet. Food was served buffet-style with unmasked guests serving from the same spoons/cutlery - this made us really uncomfortable, as on one of the days the resort was operating at full capacity. The safety of guests must be prioritised in such situations. 

Food

While the food wasn't terrible, it does not deserve special mention. The choices of food served were always very random. On one night we were served macaroni and cheese, accompanied with a potato curry coleslaw. The combinations of the side dishes and mains could use some thought. 

Service
The service at the property was fine. Although we did notice that they were severely understaffed. Suresh, the manager, was compliant with all our requests. Our waiter, Kumara, was also polite and friendly. 

Environmental Impact
We were surprised to find that the property offered plastic water bottles in each room, which did not fit with their ethos of being 'eco-friendly'. This is something the upper management should seriously consider: either switch to glass bottles or offer filtered water for guests. It is simply not acceptable to consume so many single-use plastic bottles.

Maintenance
The wooden walkway to our cottage had loose boards and sections missing. This could potentially be a hazard, especially for small children. On our first night, there was also no running water in our bathroom. The property did offer to change our rooms, but we chose not to considering it was nearly 10pm in the night. We were informed that this issue had happened before, which makes us wonder why it was overlooked the first time?

Overall, we feel this property has great potential. The location is beautiful, the surrounding river and waterfalls are stunning. Although there were no proper designated trails or paths, there is also potential to promote this as a destination for birdwatchers. We sighted the rare and endemic Racket-tail drongo and other unique species like the Indian Pitta and Tickell's Blue Flycatcher.

We sincerely hope the upper management does look into these factors. In my opinion, at the current price, the experience at Ella Jungle Resort is simply not worth it.","Read this before you visit  Ella Jungle resort.","2022-02","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g19492837-d4465330-r829312530-Ella_Jungle_Resort-Karandagolla_Uva_Province.html",,"586","480697281","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/a6/db/c1/teedemel.jpg","586","25","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teedemel","Tashiya","3F428AC81FECC1D603E18FE7921F0A69",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","teedemel"

All those things just disappeared with your heartfelt welcome and with the way you treated us (for giving us a chance to stay few more hours since we were late to check-in and for the complimentary surprise  cake for my husband's bday).

Man muss ca. 5-10 Minuten laufen um ins Meer zu gehen.

Unfortunately we missed that destination due to the pandemic situation in that era. Just three weeks before in this year, we visited this place and it is ""Jetwing Surf"". 
  We managed to reach this dream location, around 11.00 am. and the place was full house during our arrival, due to the long weekend. But the hotel staff used the full of their effort to arrange cottages asap for both of our families. Just after the lunch we could receive the cottages. In-house environment of this cottage is really unique and unbelievably wonderful. It's very spacious, luxurious but mostly completed with the nature friendly materials, without neglecting to manage the high cleanliness. Very specially I've never experienced to spend under an ""Iluk"" (some grass) roof in a luxurious place like this.
  Calmness with the only sound of the waves, made an unbelievable peaceful environment for us. Beach, which long for four-five miles, in front of the cottages are so spectacular. I short of my vocabulary to describe the scenery made by  the silent sea, which reflected the beams of full moon at the night. It's continued till midnight, even after finished our dinner, which we took under the roof of ""sky"", with fully decorated by thousands of “blinking stars”.
  All meals made with great deliciousness. Somehow what I feel is, if  the hotels of ""Jetwing chain"" promote to show the talents of their culinary staff, with including the “buffets” for in-house guests, it will be more helpful to increase the demand, when tourists search the locations for enjoying.
  Staff of this hotel (from the gate to the kitchen specially including front desk) was so friendly, polite and well trained incomparably. Specially like to remind Jehan and Kavushalya of front office, who served us so supportively under the guidance of their head - Mr. Hafi. Helpfulness and friendliness of Mr. Hafi which overcame his professional boundaries, just like a family friend, will be unforgettable.
Again thanks a lot for you and your staff Mr. Hafi, for the precious time which we 
  could spent, with dream come true after a period of four years.....

We spent two nights here on our tour of Sri Lanka and had a wonderful time. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a loft room which seemed good, however the bed was upstairs and the toilet was down rather steep stairs which we had concerns about. Prochane the duty manager fully understood this and arranged a different upgrade for us so that we were on one level. We would have been happy with a lower grade room but he went out of his way to honour the upgrade.  Could not fault this. Everything about this hotel was first class from the service, pool, breakfast etc.  It is a delightful oasis in an ideal location in the quirky and charming town of Galle. The only small downside for us was that the evening menu was a bit limited for us and we felt it could have had a few more classic dishes on it.  
We had a brilliant young waiter serving us most of the time, he was cheerful, smiled and had a great sense of humour. Sadly I can't find his his name and he was such a great ambassador for the Galle fort.
Highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay again.","A gem in the old town of Galle","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r1008972494-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"3096","412459588","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/95/a2/44/swisstrekkers.jpg","3096","49","101","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swisstrekkers","Swisstrekkers","98C690FCD5826F0F7DEEA607DB43C41F",,,,,"Swisstrekkers"

Several elements of your experience were explained to you at the hotel when you first discussed this with us.  Being a heritage building, we have severe restrictions on what can and cannot be done to the building.  That being said, you were offered an opportunity to move rooms on the day you arrived, which you turned down ""because you didn't want to deal with the stairs"", despite having to use stairs to reach the room you had booked.

The Grand Apartment Suite which is the one across from you, is connected by a sitting room, which, unless used, insulates you from any sound coming from the room itself.  We cannot account for sound coming from the property next door, however.

Lastly, the cancellation policy was made very clear prior to booking, and was the reason that no refund was offered.  Your original reason for leaving was the lack of exhaust fan in the bathroom.  When we explained that the cancellation policy would still apply, then other ""issues"" came to light.

We are sorry that your experience was not what you had hoped for, but this matter has been dealt.  We hope the rest of your travels around Sri Lanka were more to your liking.","4080","794930740","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/61/ae/34/caption.jpg","3072","4080","794930741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/61/ae/35/caption.jpg","3072",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28 Church Street, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"28 Church Street","","556080","6.026645","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.21746","Galle Fort Hotel","1100","4.5","27","18","79","215","761","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d556080-Reviews-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.galleforthotel.com/","2025-03-18","OTHER","1",,"Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","1","Cleanliness","2","Service","1","Sleep Quality","1","My wife and I came here hoping to have a relaxed getaway.

We are sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your stay at The Galle Fort Hotel.  The trouble with a 400 year old Unesco Heritage building is that we have immense restrictions on what we are able to do, structurally, that don't disrupt the integrity of the property.  This does mean, however, that wooden ceilings which are also wooden floors can be disruptive if the room above is occupied, and the other guests have early starts for activities like whale watching or flights to catch.  We are currently working with the Galle Heritage Foundation on the best way to resolve this, without going against their rules.

I also presume by ""large holes in the carpet, torn curtains"", that you are referring to the mosquito nets that hang from the bed itself (as a precaution against any mosquitoes that might be present), and the original panel rugs that cover the top canopy of the bed, as we have no curtains in any of our rooms.  Certainly the floor carpet, recently purchased, doesn't have holes.

This for the following reasons …
Rooms are extremely poorly insulated, you can hear every word and every step of your neighbors. For us, both nights were over by 05:30. The room ( a 600 USD Suite!) was neglected (e.g. large holes in the carpet, torn curtains 
 etc.)
The breakfast service was always chaotic, the menu cards dirty and worn.

We are sorry that the room you viewed online, with images of the layout, views and furnishings, prior to making your booking, was not what you expected, with the ""tasteless furniture"" that is true to the colonial heritage of a nearly 400 year old building.  Your disappointment was noted at the time of check in, and an alternative room offered to you, which you chose not to take.  This matter was dealt with, on site, in line with our policies and the booking terms that you would have been aware of prior to making the booking, and clearly explained to you at the time.

Thank you for letting us know how disappointed with your stay you were.  

Whilst your experience definitely left you with a bitter taste in your mouth, and there were some communication issues at the time, one of your rooms WAS ready at 13:30, and the other room was in fact ready at 14:05, and the staff agreed with you that check ins would be done simultaneously after lunch.  At this time, you made the request that the luggage be put in the rooms in the interim, which was done.  Usually, we put the luggage in the room after the guests have been shown to the room, so that we can put the luggage in an area that suits them; leaving the cases downstairs made sense at the time.  Going forward, we will of course put the luggage near the beds instead.

Your lunch was, unfortunately, delayed somewhat due to a group of 26 that was dining at the same time, and the kitchen was trying to ensure that they all got their meals together at the same time.  We apologise for not being able to get your meals out at the same time.

We do apologise unreservedly for the delay at breakfast the following morning, however; there was a communication breakdown between our kitchen and service teams, which resulted in your meal taking longer than it should have.

The staff were friendly and attentive almost without fault, although the bar staff in particular seemed to be struggling to cope with a lack of manpower, so service was apt to be a bit 'manana'. Our first floor, beachfront room was great, with wonderful views, particularly of the fishermen one morning. Towel service was very good. Restaurant buffet food was excellent, with an extensive menu, surely enough to suit all tastes. 
The beach bar was underused, so for us, ideally quiet and calm. The beach itself was clean, sandy and very long.
If you have the time and inclination, the boat ride to snorkel at Pigeon Island is perhaps worth a go. The ride is about 25 mins each way in total and a bit hard and bumpy. The snorkel area itself is fairly limited and the reef badly bleached, but we snorkeled with a trio of 2m blacktip reefs sharks and spent a few minutes tracking a turtle, which was quite something given the state of the reef. There are the usual reef fish too but not in the quantities you'd see in the Maldives, but the sharks were the big bonus.","Trinco woo, woo","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1003506068-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"768","397806194","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/b6/0a/72/michaelth3331uw.jpg","768","21","64","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeltH3331UW","Michael T","06785A19C9CCD8F58BC8C778BD508AD0",,"186406","Chichester, United Kingdom","Chichester","michaeltH3331UW"

Thank you for your review on Trinco Blu by Cinnamon and taking the time to share your experience of your stay. While we are pleased to know you enjoyed aspects of your visit such as the location, scenery, and service from our housekeeping and pool teams, we truly regret to learn that certain elements did not meet your expectations.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience experienced at the Crab restaurant. There was an unfortunate oversight with the salad dressing, which was promptly rectified once brought to our attention, along with a complimentary serving of French fries as a gesture of goodwill. We regret that this may not have fully addressed your satisfaction.

We also acknowledge your comments regarding service delays, and we are taking steps to reinforce attentiveness and responsiveness among our staff to ensure more seamless experience for all guests.

Regarding the presence of flies, this is a persistent challenge especially during rainy periods. Despite our scheduled pest control treatments, the open-air nature of the restaurant and the need to keep doors open for guest convenience may occasionally result in increased activity. However, we have taken all necessary measures to rectify this issue as much as we can. 

We make every effort to manage stray animals on the property; however, interactions from some guests can inadvertently hinder our ability to keep them away.

Lastly, we regret the inconvenience caused by the air conditioning issue in your room. While our team responded promptly, the delay in fully resolving the matter was unfortunate, and we thank you for your patience.

Your feedback is greatly valued and will help us improve. Once again, thank you and we look forward to welcoming you back to Trinco Blu by Cinnamon on your next visit to Trincomalee. Best Regards, Rohan Jayathilaka Front Office Manager

Unfortunately the details let it down- especially for how much this place costs. 

Had a week here as a family (currently in day 6) as part of a travel across northern Sri Lanka. The third stop of our trip and definitely the worst food and service so far- coolly the very frustrating beach side bar. 

The food in The Crab beach bar is terrible, kept giving it a chance and each time it let us down- completely stale bread for sandwich on first visit. Ordered a Thai crab salad on second visit and they forgot to put dressing. Kids food just reheated frozen food. Service is painfully slow, often the staff just ignore you- I just went for a coffee and the team member blatantly ignored me for 10 minutes so I just gave up. 

Breakfast buffet OK but lots of flies and inconsistent service. 

Some detail around the resort needs work- the beach gets a lot of roundish washed up each morning and it takes hours for it to be cleared up. Our aircon was leaking on the first night quite badly (like a waterfall!), they came to fix but it was still leaking for the next two days with pools of water everywhere- eventually maintenance came and fixed. 

Positives- nice greeting with fresh cold juice and wet towell. Very friendly and helpful pool towel service, great views, lots of sunbeds by pool and beach, housekeeping good and efficient.  Nice to see the fishermen in the morning on the beach bringing in their catch. 

Would I stay again, probably not but tbh there isn’t much choice in the area.","Let down by the detail…","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d1775384-r1002875369-Trinco_Blu_By_Cinnamon-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"720","80478775","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/cc/02/37/ben_r.jpg","960","12","27","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benr963","Ben R","E60381B5DBC1FCC93B2DC6FF488D5F2A",,,,,"benr963"

The people at reception were always kind,  the waiters at the restaurant too and the security were always there to help, There was one day where we had many people over for dinner and the waiters made the table really well and extended their closing hours so we could enjoy our night. 

The only thing I’d change about the hotel is to add some privacy in the bedroom’s bathrooms as there are gaps in between the doors in the toilet, which doesn’t make people feel comfortable to use. Furthermore, if the windows could be covered more to block people from seeing from the bedroom and a proper door instead of the door with gaps would be beneficial too.","The Amazing NH Collection Colombo!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d11953119-r1010703321-Nh_Collection_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markkS797BD","Mark K","7B07840AFE98E360475B79B892CB4099",,,,,"markkS797BD"

We had a characterful bedroom - small but functional room with a balcony looking down over the gardens to the sea beyond.  The room did need a little updating with some of the furniture needing varnishing.  The balcony was a good size with two comfortable chairs.

The large swimming pool was delightful right by the beach.  There were sunbeds available both by the pool and on the beach and towels were provided.

What made our stay however was the Cutty Sark Restaurant where we enjoyed 4 dinners.  Quite simply we didn´t want to eat anywhere else because of the lovely atmosphere here.  On one of the nights we had the special set 5 course dinner with a table romantically set up, not quite on the beach but as good as. Their homemade coconut ice cream was lovely. The atmosphere was so romantic watching the waves on the beach. There are also chairs overlooking the beach to have pre-dinner drinks and watch the sunset. The cocktails we had were excellent. Breakfast was also very good in the same restaurant.

The other factor that made our stay were the staff, who were delightful.  Nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and relaxing.","Delightful small hotel","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d654256-r992868601-Weligama_Bay_Resort-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg","1200","369","595","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretGranada","Margaret Granada","2CCE48F6279B08C80CC6EE87AACC5A97",,"666316","Altea, Spain","Altea","MargaretGranada"

The rooms in the main building are also very spacious and very clean and the service is superb. the rooms unlike what you might get in a sterile 5 star hotel have a Sri Lankan ambience and the resort is small. The Restaurant Cutty Sark, has superb staff who will cook you whatever Sri Lankan dish you want. We had five amazing dinners, party of 15 on the verandah overlooking the pool and the ocean.

Thank you for your comprehensive review from your recent stay in Weligama Bay Resort. We would like to assure you that our main aim is to provide the highest level of hospitality. Therefore we are very sorry that we didn´t meet your expectations.
We were discussing your review with the team and to be honest they were quite surprised as there was no complain from your side during your original 6 nights stay not even during your extension for another 2 nights. 
They said you were very nice guests with your daughter. We would expected the guest that extended his stay was satisfied with the hotel service provided. 
Yes we are very sorry there was the delay with serving the meal one day due to a mixed orders in kitchen. Our chef and food &beverage manager sincerely apologized for this their mistake and offered you home made ice cream.
The beach area is standartly arranged with two rows of sunbeds and umbrellas and there are other around pool area some prepared in advance and some on request. Unfortunatelley  there were higher water than usually during end of December in our part of bay so we were unable to allocate as much sunbeds as usually on beach side.
Our Cutty Sark ala carte restaurant prices are comparable with other restaurants whose owners are tax and VAT payers as well as we are. Of course the smaller local restaurants are cheaper and this makes the offer more variable for Weligama visitors. 
We were shocked by one point of your review and we were investigating this with our staff. It was the information about one our worker that tried to sell you ""jewelry under the counter"" as you said. We do hope to know our staff well because this is first time we have ever heard any such information. If this would be truth of course it is not acceptable. So if you remember the name or the person we would be grateful for the further information.
However we consider all your points and will discuss again with our team.

We wish you all the best.

Als Vater mit Kind, der bewusst ein hochpreisiges Hotel mit gehobenem Service gewählt hatte, wurde ich mehrfach eines Besseren belehrt.

Zimmer und Ausstattung

Das Zimmer war zwar geräumig, doch der versprochene Meerblick war kaum vorhanden. Stattdessen offenbarte sich die enorme Hellhörigkeit der Zimmer: Wir konnten jedes Wort der Nachbarn über uns und nebenan hören. Zudem war die Jalousieleiste halb abgerissen, und auch wenn die Schimmelfugen in der Dusche für asiatische Hotels nicht ungewöhnlich sind, trugen sie nicht gerade zum Wohlfühlfaktor bei.

Pool und Schattenplätze

Der Poolbereich des Hotels war eine Enttäuschung. Für alle Gäste standen lediglich drei Sonnenschirme zur Verfügung – ein völlig unzureichendes Angebot. Am Strand war es nicht besser, da die Flut die Liegen teilweise unterspülte und sie unbrauchbar machte. Trotz Bemühungen des Personals war an eine entspannte Zeit am Pool oder Strand kaum zu denken.

Zusätzlich war die Handhabung von Bestellungen am Pool äußerst nervig: Zu jeder Bestellung mussten zwei Unterschriften geleistet werden. Dies wurde besonders störend, da Belege nicht automatisch vorgelegt wurden. Stattdessen wurden sie entweder auf explizite Nachfrage gebracht oder eilig hinterhergetragen, falls ein Gast ohne Unterschrift zu gehen drohte. Eine einfache Lösung, wie das unaufgeforderte Bereitstellen der Belege zur Bestellung, scheint hier nicht bedacht worden zu sein. Außerdem hätte der Umsatz durch proaktiven Service erheblich gesteigert werden können – z. B. durch das aktive Anbieten von Getränken an Gäste am Pool oder Strand. Stattdessen musste man stets selbst die Initiative ergreifen.

Service: Licht und viel Schatten

Der Service war in großen Teilen enttäuschend. Besonders irritierend war das Verhalten eines Servicemitarbeiters, der zunächst einen äußerst professionellen Eindruck machte. Doch dieser Eindruck wurde schnell getrübt, als er versuchte, mir „unter der Theke“ Schmuck zu verkaufen – offensichtlich schwarz und ohne Bezug zu seiner eigentlichen Aufgabe. Dieses Verhalten ist in einem 4-Sterne-Hotel vollkommen inakzeptabel und zeugt von einem eklatanten Mangel an Professionalität und Aufsicht durch das Management.

Zusätzlich erlebte ich einen weiteren Mitarbeiter, der mich um Zigaretten anschnorrte. Solche Vorkommnisse tragen maßgeblich dazu bei, dass der Gesamteindruck des Servicepersonals negativ ausfällt. Eine positive Ausnahme war der Mitarbeiter Lakindu, der im Bar- und Restaurantbereich einen durchweg hervorragenden, aufmerksamen und freundlichen Service geboten hat.

Gastronomie

Das Restaurant des Hotels verlangte für Speisen und Getränke Preise, die bis zu neunmal höher waren als in umliegenden Restaurants. Qualität und Service rechtfertigten diese Preisgestaltung nicht im Ansatz. Besonders unverständlich war der Zeitversatz bei der Essensausgabe: Zwei Gerichte für zwei Gäste – ein lokales Sri-Lanka-Reisgericht und ein Nasi Goreng – wurden mit einem Abstand von 20 Minuten serviert. Die Begründung, eines der Gerichte sei „so aufwendig“, ist schlicht nicht akzeptabel. In einem Restaurant dieser Preisklasse sollte die Küche in der Lage sein, die Speisen zeitgleich zuzubereiten und zu servieren, insbesondere wenn es sich nur um zwei Personen handelt.

Am Anreisetag wurde uns als „Entgegenkommen“ ein Frühstück für 5000 Rupien pro Person angeboten – unabhängig davon, dass meine Tochter lediglich Obst aß. Günstigere In-Room-Angebote wurden uns nicht kommuniziert. Auch das wirkt wenig gastfreundlich.

Rezeption: Widersprüche und mangelnde Unterstützung

Die Rezeption war ein weiterer Schwachpunkt. Eine einfache Frage nach den realistischen Kosten für ein Tuktuk in die Stadt wurde mit einem überzogenen Preis von 1000 bis 2000 Rupien beantwortet – wohl wissend, dass die tatsächlichen Kosten bei etwa 190 Rupien lagen (über die App PickMe).

Beim Checkout wiederholte sich das unprofessionelle Verhalten: Rechnungen konnten erst bearbeitet werden, als das Hauptpersonal anwesend war. Besonders enttäuschend war die Weigerung, uns Wasser für eine bevorstehende 3,5-stündige Zugfahrt bereitzustellen – stattdessen wurde uns empfohlen, Wasser an der Hotelbar zu kaufen. So ein unmenschliches Verhalten habe ich weltweit noch nie erlebt.

Fazit

Das Weligama Bay Resort bietet nicht annähernd den Standard, den man bei einem 4-Sterne-Haus erwarten darf. Die Kombination aus schlechtem Service, extrem überteuerten Preisen und mangelnder Gastfreundschaft macht dieses Hotel zu einer schlechten Wahl. Trotz einzelner positiver Erlebnisse (besonders dank des Mitarbeiters Lakindu) kann ich dieses Hotel nicht empfehlen.

Ich hoffe, dass das Management diese Kritik ernst nimmt und die grundlegenden Mängel behebt.","Große Enttäuschung im Weligama Bay Resort: Ein 4-Sterne-Haus, das nicht liefert","2024-11","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d654256-r987678980-Weligama_Bay_Resort-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389359","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophereK5744KY","Christopher E","A4238135ACECE8789FEC392CA4FE529E",,"187337","Frankfurt, Germany","Frankfurt","christophereK5744KY"

Thank you for your review as even not a positive review gives us a chance to improve our service. 
We are surprised you are judging of our staff as rude and uncaring because many guests consider our staff caring and attentive, that always treating them very well with an aim to fill wide spectrum of their individual wishes.
As we have many repeated guests we may thing they do their job well. But there is always chance to be better, of course.
Regarding the hotel entry and reception area we always paid attention for fresh green around lobby area and respect Sri Lankan design of furniture and decoration in lobby.

At check in our guide spoke to the receptionist as I had asked if our room was a sea view, and told only partial. So asked if we could upgrade but that was a no, and felt that the young lady was a bit unfriendly. Our guide spoke for us and we were offered another room and I could go see both and choose, which I thought was kind but I am sure it was our guide whom the receptionist was trying to please? We chose the second room S04 which had a better sea view than S09? Room was clean enough. The dining room is down at the beach and just loved having breakfast there albeit there was not a lot of choice but they did make my husband porridge oats every morning which he loved. We chose this hotel rather than the Marriot next door as wanted more of a Sri Lankan experience rather than be in a modern sky scraper building. Dining staff very friendly, more friendly than Miss Snotty at reception! I loved the beach area which was very clean and tidy, though walking along the beach to the right and left you found that the beach there was not clean and filled with rubbish, really shocking, and so glad that we were at the most cleanest part of this beautiful surfers paradise. We just loved sitting on the chairs on the raised stoned area looking out to the sea and watching all the new surfers being trained. Our Half Board menu was ok and enjoyed what we had chosen but the coconut ice cream is to die for, absolutely amazing! Our flights back were late at night and asked Miss Snotty if we could have a late check out, but it would  cost us $117 for 5 hours, I asked if they could do better and since we were half board would they give us some kind of meal or snack before leaving. A definite no but brought the price down to $100. So we agreed on the price but asked if fresh towels and bottles of water could be provided and yes to towels but no to water?  I said to them that we felt that was very mean not to give us the water and they relented. We felt that the receptionist was unhelpful (only doing the minimum)  and bit unfriendly when we were asking on tuc tucs to Mirissa and also a driver to take us to Galle. The hotel driver was so very friendly on our trip to Galle which we thoroughly enjoyed as was the tuc tuc driver to Mirissa. Lovely lovely people. The location of the hotel, The clean beach and pool area and attendants,  the friendliness from the dining staff and where the dining room was were for us the best parts of our stay there. The reception staff not as helpful and friendly.","Great beach area","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d654256-r977106642-Weligama_Bay_Resort-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg","1200","405","914","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthyGlasgow","RuthyGlasgow","92EAC361C6C6AA71514EB1241C55B8FB",,,,,"RuthyGlasgow"

Spa and Wellness center with the master Mona of many kinds of massage (I personally experienced there the  Balinese body massage, hands massage, and the head and face massage) was absolutely enjoyable and gifted for my body and soul!

We used to visit Captain Seafood Restaurant on Passikudah road for lunch and dinner. The owner of the restaurant Roshan is very friendly, hospitable, and professional. We didn't want to go for seafood and fresh juices and mix fruit cocktails but to the Roshan's restaurant. He also provided us with 2 interesting, impressive, comfortable, and well-organized excursions to Pigeon Island, Conesh Waram Hindu Temple, Deers Park (Trincomalee tour), and the Ramboda trip (Damro tea plantation, Ramboda beautiful waterfalls, and Spice Garden).

The only discomfort we felt in the hotel were dogs who barked and had quarrels near our doors and windows daily and nightly distracting us from the rest and sleeping.

The rooms are well-kept and spacious, with very large, comfortable beds. The villas especially are very large, housing a family of 4 with great comfort. The hotel is very close to the ocean, and the beach set up is comfortable. However, the food and drinks left much to be desired. There is only one restaurant, which predominately works buffet-style (there is an a la carte option, but the choices are practically identical to the buffet) and the food it offers was not of high quality neither in terms of taste, presentation nor freshness. The freshness of desserts was especially questionable, and the quality of the fresh juices was disappointing, as they were heavily watered down. Fortunately for us, there is a string of small local restaurants nearby, where the dinner options are much better. Overall, if one is not fussy about food, or does not mind dining out, we would still recommend, although it is well to keep the above in mind.","A good hotel, although with disappointing food and beverages.","2024-08","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2193270-d10151979-r966438669-Anantaya_Resort_Spa-Kalkudah_Eastern_Province.html",,"1024","338914442","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/33/6c/8a/agnieszka-j.jpg","1024","1","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnieszkaj929","Agnieszka W","30BEE03ECDF015F6B3FFB7AE9E3D39CD",,"274725","Gdansk, Poland","Gdansk","agnieszkaj929"

Compliments of the season, and thank you for sharing your thoughts.  I will take them up with the kitchen team and do a thorough retest of the various flavours, as they absolutely should be authentic, and are definitely not ""watered down"".  Sri Lankan food is not specifically ""spicy"" hot, per se, but it does have a variety of different spice flavours, all affected by the region a dish comes from, and we try to respect those regions by recreating their dishes authentically.  If we are missing that mark, and the food is not spicy hot enough, guests can always request housemade chilli or fresh chillies to add to their meals.

However, it's good to know that for you, we didn't get it right, and we can make the necessary changes to sort this out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28 Church Street, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"28 Church Street","","556080","6.026645","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.21746","Galle Fort Hotel","1100","4.5","27","18","79","215","761","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d556080-Reviews-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.galleforthotel.com/","2025-01-07","MOBILE","2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My review is not about the hotel, but its restaurant

Its located in the hotel and overlooks the room blocks and the swimming pool. At dinner, the ambiance was beautiful and relaxing. 

The menu for dinner had a selection of starters. The main courses were divided into a section suggesting that dishes were from specific parts of Sri Lanka and another section with straightforward mains. The starters were good. We ordered 3 different mains to be shared. The portions were only good for one person and not enough to be shared. We should have been better advised by the waiter. 

And the main courses were bland. Despite being advised by the waiter that they would be spicy. Sri Lankan food is great. But the ones produced here are bland and a very poor representation of Sri Lankan flavours. Perhaps they have been watered down to suit the Western palates. If so, let the patrons know so that we can request for Sri Lankan authentic flavours

I would not recommend this restaurant for its food.","Lovely Ambiance at Restaurant but if its Sri Lankan flavours that you’re looking for, then this is not the place","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r988139618-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","221","243","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siglo","Siglo","2AB4FCDD4F6BF222B2B08E96DCD7BAE8",,"298570","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","siglo"

Compliments of the season.  

I'm so sorry to read of your frustrations with booking accommodation for your family at the Galle Fort Hotel. 

That said, we ABSOLUTELY do welcome families with children.  However, given the age and design of the property, there will be certain rooms that we prefer not to allocate to families with small children, due to safety concerns.  We also have a limited number of rooms, aside from those, which can accommodate extra beds, and still provide you enough space as a family.

We are guilty of having 3 kids so we called them directly to book 2 rooms, asking for a baby cot as well.
We were told no rooms could accommodate us and no additional beds could be put except in the library suite (68sqm) but not on the other suites (some bigger).
After rechecking the hotel site and wasting an hour trying to understand we called the hotel again.

At the end we were just clearly told that it is the hotel policy not to accommodate families and kids.

Very disappointing.
At least they should be honest and indicate the hotel as adults only on their website.
But I guess that in off season they are happy to take the money from families....

There are many other nice hotels around, so if you are a family...go somewhere else !","Families and kids not welcome!","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d556080-r988022096-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priscillawG5385SF","Priscilla W","BDF986B549BF8F76F0B04FADADF6322D",,,,,"priscillawG5385SF"

We really appreciate your feedback and sharing positive experience from your recent stay with us and other travelers. 
It is a pleasure to read you have liked not only the room design but also that you enjoyed your ""flavorful journey"" through our restaurant menu as well.
On behalf of our staff I especially thanks for your kind words towards their performance.
We always consider guests´ satisfaction during their stay and this includes quiet and comfort in the room to sleep in the night. 
Therefore, we doubled entrance doors into all rooms in the main building to increase a level of acoustic insulation from outdoor corridor.

We look forward to welcome you back in Weligama Bay Resort.

The bungalows were connected to each other which was great as a family and the space was very roomy. The villa was also perfect for two people. The resort itself was very beautiful with long palm trees that makes you feel like you are in paradise, a swimming pool with Jacuzzi, spa, and restaurant. 

The resort is also connected to Welligama beach which is ideal if you want to have some drinks with some breeze looking at surfers or book some surfing lessons (well worth it!). There are also a number of food courts nearby if you want to try local cuisine. It is also nice to go for a walk and talk with some locals.

Most importantly, the entire staff make you feel very welcome. Not only do they provide good service (what you expect from a resort), but they are also observant and friendly. For example, I was interested in discovering some Sri Lankan music and they played a diverse list of songs. 

Even though we went as a family, I think this resort is well worth it for couples, friends or solo travellers because of the friendly staff and the beautiful location.

I only booked the place 2 hours before we arrived and they already prepared a nice welcome sign in our family bungalow to wish us happy birthday/anniversary. And then after dinner they surprised us with a divine chocolate cake, which they baked for us! 
The food was amazing throughout the whole stay.
The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.
The entire property felt well maintained.
My husband also tried their spa and said the massage was one of the best ones he has had (and he goes regularly).

Positives absolutely kind friendly staff the grounds are beautifully maintained and it’s right on the beach.
We paid for a premium room which was a front villa with amazing views.  
The room staff did an amazing job with towel art and kept the room spotless.  
The restaurant table service was excellent with lovely tables and comfortable chairs.
We ate out most nights for a variety.  The chef was kind enough to cook some SriLankan food as an alternative to set breakfast.  He was really accommodating and friendly.

The room wasn’t ready upon arrival as the air conditioning wasn’t working.  They had about 4 maintenance crew having a look at it.   Eventually they got it going.  It’s an old rusted out Toshiba Air con but certainly cooled the room very quick.   The room was lovely and well fitted out.  The bath room is dated but certainly did the job.

Sadly Air Conditioner broke down again which couldn’t be fixed.  The only ignoring part is they knew it was broken before we arrived as a part had burnt out causing it to trip power on the compressor.

We were moved to a different room which was slightly smaller and had a cheap Chinese air conditioner which was undersized for the room. It didn’t really chill the room much.  This villa type on Agoda was about $30 cheaper a night.  The bath room on this villa had a rotted out shower frame with various mould types from black, pink and a kind of brown colour.  Green moss was also growing on frame.  It was so rotted that caused the bathroom to flood when you had a shower.   It is a slip hazard we just used towels where the holes were.
I figured if you didn’t touch the mould you would be ok.   Not sure how children would go but they did have an option of a bath.

Only  5 rooms were booked in the whole place as it was there off season.  Hopefully repairs will occur.  The Marriott is next door for the same price if you like high rise accomodation or W15 which is also a couple of doors down and much newer.

I really loved the location of the hotel.  The surf instructor was fantastic.  
In fact all the staff are a credit to this hotel.  They just need to spend some money on maintenance.  Our shower hose was split which I didn’t really care about but certainly other guests would this is a very easy fix.","Beautiful location friendly staff.

I can only say we were blown away by the level of service from the lovely staff. 

The chef and restaurant manager were exceptional and so lovely. They greeted us every day and made us off menu food as well. Every meal we had was delicious and pretty reasonably priced for the area. 

One day we mentioned we were going whale watching the next morning and the chef went out of his way to make us a packed breakfast to our liking and left with security for us to take with us at 5am. 

One day when I fancied a Sri Lankan breakfast they made me my own beautiful meal with so much food. I can’t stress how much they made our stay amazing.

Thank you for sharing such a heartfelt and detailed review of your recent stay at Jetwing Surf. We are truly delighted to hear about your wonderful experience and the special moments that made your seaside vacation with us so memorable.
Our cabanas, crafted with natural materials like coconut fronds, are designed to blend seamlessly with the environment while offering our guests comfort and a close connection to nature. It’s heartening to know that you appreciated our efforts to remain environmentally sustainable and enjoyed the unique charm of our “wild” surroundings.
We are especially glad to hear that our Christmas Eve celebrations added a magical touch to your stay. It was our pleasure to bring joy to your family through festive dining, carols, and little surprises for the children.
Your kind words about Jehan truly mean the world to us. They, along with the entire Jetwing Surf team, are dedicated to ensuring our guests feel cared for and safe, and we’re glad they could offer you support during an unexpected situation.
It is also touching to know you joined our Tsunami commemoration, a moment we hold close to our hearts. We value your reflection on this and will continue to create opportunities for remembrance and awareness.
Thank you for recommending Jetwing Surf to your extended family. We hope to welcome you all again, perhaps even on your next journey from Kandy, to experience more unforgettable moments with us.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

The 'hotel' made every attempt to remain environmentally sustainable. The recognition of Christmas-eve with a specially-curated dinner, little gifts from Santa for the kids and trinkets for all, carols from a local church with a Santa in attendance made the stay truly memorable and magical for my family! Manager of the Hotel, Mr. Hafi, and the receptionist Mr. Jehan were the epitome of hospitality, Mr. Jehan expressing concern about our safety after being informed that our car had met with an accident on the way. In line with their environmental sustainability policy, the hotel does not try 'own' the beach and landscape its surroundings too much. Its seeming isolation and 'wild', one-with-the environment appearance was something we appreciated. I've already recommended the hotel to members of the extended family although it's a long distance to travel from Kandy!

We also appreciated the Tsunami commemoration by the Hotel. We joined them but were saddened to notice that the other Sri Lankan families/visitors there did not think to join the commemoration for the 5-10 minutes it took!

Jetwing Surf is a beautiful hotel located in a serene coastal area, offering exceptional views and a peaceful retreat. We visited to celebrate our kid's birthday, and from the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff. The room(Cabana) was nicely cleaned and well-maintained, and it met all the promises made during the booking process.

The surrounding views are simply breathtaking, with a clean, quiet beach right at the doorstep, perfect for relaxing or enjoying the natural beauty. The dining area, though limited in size, was sufficiently serviced to meet all our needs. The alà carte menu provided a limited variety of delicious options, but the staff ensured that all our dining preferences were taken care of.

The hotel also boasts a nicely maintained pool, with a well-prepared lifeguard present at all times. I was especially impressed with the additional care provided for kids. I experienced their attentiveness firsthand during a little incident with my young ones, and they ensured everything was handled with great care and caution.

A special thank you goes to Dulanjana, whose dedication and exceptional service made our stay even more memorable. The staff’s commitment to ensuring a pleasant experience was evident throughout our visit. Overall, Jetwing Surf provided a great experience with excellent service, stunning surroundings, and a comfortable atmosphere, making it a wonderful choice for families or anyone looking to enjoy a peaceful getaway by the beach.","Mind blowing experience - Best in the area.","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d12949765-r986770915-Jetwing_Surf-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","0","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChathuraKBJ","Chathura Jayasinghe","46C331DC936DBB0641B7CAFFEADDA252",,,,,"ChathuraKBJ"

The cabanas had all modern equipment while still having the thatched roofs and  palmyrah leaf walls in a cabana style.  From straw hats to toothbrushes all amenities are included in these. The dining area is also beautiful right near the pool amidst coconut trees. 
I want to mention Lakshan who served us was very patient with all our requirements in the dining area. He suggested the best dishes, best combos super friendly and always smiled. And it was a superb fine dining experience with the sea breeze. 

My little sister had a small accident and sprained her wrist and the staff ; from Life guards to the management were very helpful to find us a way to get to doctor and they gave first aid onsite. 

We have stayed in many resorts both in Sri Lanka and UK, belive me when I say Jetwing Surf is a hidden gem. Everything was absolutely beautiful and well thought of.

We stayed in a spacious sea view cabana that was perfectly equipped for all weather conditions, whether rain (umbrellas) or shine (bug spray). The cabana offered a great balance of luxury and comfort, with more than enough space to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

The service was impeccable throughout our stay. Special mention to Dinesh, who went above and beyond to organize a beautiful birthday meal right on the beach—an experience we’ll never forget. Our butler, Dulanjana, was outstanding. He was professional, attentive, and made sure we had no worries during our stay. His care and attention to detail truly enhanced our experience.

The food at Jetwing Surf was incredible. Every meal was a visual and culinary delight, thanks to the talented chef. The quality and presentation were always of the highest standard. Even during our early morning safari, the hotel ensured that we had a packed breakfast and drinks ready for our 5 AM departure, which was a thoughtful touch.

Our safari at Kumana National Park was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our trip. This was all recommended and arranged by the resort.  We were lucky enough to see leopards, elephants, deer, and so many other animals up close in their natural habitat. The wildlife was abundant, and the best part was how peaceful it felt—at times, it seemed like we had the entire park to ourselves!

The experience was well-organized and truly immersive. The beauty of Kumana lies not just in the animals but also in the quiet, untouched wilderness. It’s a must-do for anyone visiting the area, and we highly recommend it!

We also indulged in in-room massages, which were fantastic—perfect for unwinding. The pool was clean and a great spot to relax during the day.

This resort truly goes above and beyond, treating guests like royalty. We are already recommending it to our friends and family and cannot wait to return ourselves. A huge thank you to the team for making our stay so memorable!","Amazing experience!","2024-10","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608525-d12949765-r976780368-Jetwing_Surf-Pottuvil_Arugam_Bay_Eastern_Province.html",,"3024","770252151","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/e9/1d/77/r123456789.jpg","3024","23","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R123456789","R123456789","DB46EC32927404369C0DDA7FA3D7F46C",,,,,"R123456789"

This beachside hotel featured an extensive pool area (50 m pool for serious swimmers) and smaller pools for children. The hotel's grounds are quite large, allowing guests to find private spots if desired. The hotel grounds give access to a sandy beach but sea swimming is not the main theme due to surf and currents.
The rooms are spacious and well-equipped with comfortable beds and pillows. We chose the bed and breakfast option but noted there are not many dining options nearby without taking a taxi. A Tuk Tuk ride to Galle, approximately 15 km away, costs about £8 each way, with drivers willing to wait a couple of hours for you in the price.
Breakfast at the hotel offers a wide variety, including pastries, fresh fruit, smoothies, cooked breakfast options, and continental bread basket selections. Many might find a midday meal unnecessary after a substantial breakfast.
The main menu is extensive, featuring Sri Lankan curries, prawn and fish options, as well as chicken, lamb, and vegetarian dishes. There are also burger, chicken  and fish and chips options for those who prefer less spicy food. Most main courses are priced around $15 USD, with starters ranging from $5 to $15 USD. We found a main course sufficient though. however a couple of glasses of wine and beer can double the price of a meal.
The staff were consistently excellent throughout the hotel. While service in the restaurant occasionally suffered when busy, this appeared to be a management or training issue rather than a reflection on the staff, who were always responsive and helpful.
Overall, the country is very welcoming, with friendly locals who value tourism. The accommodation, food quality, and service were all commendable.

The pool area is never too crowded and the view is amazing.
They even have a small turtle nesting area and let the baby turtles out in the sea when they hatch. 
Only constructive feedback I would give the hotel is to up their food quality a bit and perhaps explain their guests about how breakfast works a bit better - we were so confused. Also, I had a message, which was nice - but the price of 18.500 LKR is obscenely expensive for what you actually get (there is not even a consultation before to meet expectations of the message, which I would expect for that much money)

Breakfast was exceptional with endless options and our Ocean view room was beautiful, so spacious with stunning views of the pool, beach and sunsets.

All the staff are wonderful with very good training and always smiling.  Particular thanks to Nuwan the pool guy and we loved seeing the baby turtles which are hatching in an area to the side of the pool, such a great initiative by the hotel.  

The beach by the hotel is lovely for walking, very empty and under developed so you can walk for miles.   Mostly the sea is too rough for swimming but there is a little lagoon by the hotel for a dip at low tide.

We did many trips out from the hotel to Galle for cricket & history tour and Aghangama where there are lovely bars & restaurants. 

Only slight issue is the tuk tuk drivers who run like a mafia opposite the hotel, constantly trying to over charge which gets annoying & tiring every time you go out.   
If you check the Pick Me app which is the Uber for transport in Sri Lanka you can see the true price you should be paying but the Pick Me drivers were not  able to come near the hotel!

Our favourite  places in Ahangama were Kai, Hotel de Uncles & Ceylon Sliders for more modern food & cocktails and watching the surfers at sunset.   1000 LKR each way is generous for the 10 min tuk tuk ride.  It’s a lovely local town.

Best beach for swimming & snorkelling is Wijaya, often turtles there but you need to go early and leave by 10am as it gets far too busy.

From organising the necessary marriage documents to the floral arrangements, wedding bouquets and bower, decorations, cake, celebrant, music, photography, special celebratory dinner, and the list goes on., we couldn’t have been happier with all of these things and the very best service we received at the Fortress. 

A special mention to our wedding coordinator ‘GAYANI’ who went above and beyond to make sure that our wedding ceremony was successful and memorable. Her attention to detail and dedication to make sure we were happy with all the arrangements is something we will always remember and be grateful for. 

From the time we arrived until we checked out the service was exceptional. All the staff never fail to smile and greet us. The food was delicious & the atmosphere was refreshing.

Thank you for the wonderful and memorable experience!

We are sure to visit again on our next trip to Sri Lanka.","Friendly and professional staff, luxurious rooms and facilities, relaxing and refreshing atmosphere, exceptional service","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r999389401-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388900","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/24/default-avatar-2020-60.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celesteannr","Celeste Ann R","345156E6DEF3F785F7910298CCB7F896",,,,,"celesteannr"

Thank you for review.
We are delighted that you chose The Fortress Resort & Spa to end your Sri Lanka holiday and that your experience was nothing short of stunning.

We afre glad you had the chance to relax by the pool, spot turtles just off the beach, and make use of the convenient tuk tuk stand. Laksiri and the pool team will truly appreciate your kind words.

We were in the Fortress rooms which we knew in advance didn’t have a beach view and that didn’t affect us at all. The room was lovely and spacious. There was a proper size fridge, daily water provided and excellent house keeping.
The food at the White restaurant was superb, we would end up having a 3 course breakfast and ate dinner at the hotel every evening. Mr Sam was always around to answer and questions on the menu and the service staff were great.
There are plenty of sun loungers, even when coming back to the hotel in the afternoon and the pool is stunning. Turtles can be seen just off the beach and Laksiri and all the pool guys are really good.
The little tuk tuk stand opposite was handy and the staff on the hotel gate were super helpful by always agreeing the price for us with the drivers in advance.

Our room was exceptionally clean, although certain parts were a little bit tired, but we had a first class service from both Namal and Lakmar, who made sure we had everything we needed and it was a delight to see the creative displays on a few occasions on our bed when we returned. We were so surprised to see Laksiri after so many years who was now the supervisor of pool boys, we were so looked after by both Laksiri and Upul, we always had our sun loungers, towels and umbrella prepared.

The staff are most certainly worth a mention - we had a very attentive driver, who took us on excursions; the room attendant was excellent as was the pool man, who ensured we were equipped with towels day- to day on the beds of our choices!

Firstly, a massive apology for taking too long to write my 5 star review.

Our secret destination elopement wedding took two years to plan, but it only took a few moments to realise that, after touring Sri Lanka for a week, we wanted to not only relax at the Fortress for 5 days, but also to get married here as well. 

The good reviews are all you need to read. From the moment we arrived everyone knew who we were and we were treated like the king & queen of the hotel for the duration of our stay.

The huge wooden doors greet you and the moment you step through them you just know you’re in a real land of luxury and that your stay here is going to be truly memorable. 

Our Wedding Planner Gayani was there to meet us and give us a grand tour of the hotel. Our room was ready on arrival – a complimentary upgrade to a ground floor plunge pool room (WOW!) which opened up directly on to the amazing garden area with the pool & beach just several meters away. Once we were settled we met up with Gayani once again to plan our wedding day which turned out to be extremely straightforward – mainly because, once we’d chosen flowers, locations, timings, etc. Gayani simply wouldn’t let us lift a finger and she arranged absolutely everything!

After a busy week touring Sri Lanka it was finally time to relax. The pool area is stunning, the gardens are exceptionally well maintained, the beach is glorious (right hand side you can walk for miles, left hand side is a safe swimming area), the whole hotel is spotlessly clean, the bar is relaxing, the comfy sunbeds moved to where ever you’d like them, the service is quick, professional and super-friendly… I could go on and on! Every single member of staff had a smile on their face.

We were all inclusive and to our surprise some evenings in White were buffet and some a la carte, there was also a seafood BBQ buffet. We didn’t see the point of eating at the Salty Snapper but we did eat at Duo on our wedding night which was one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Some reviews said it was a little pricey but as it was our wedding night we decided to treat ourselves.  The restaurant staff were all amazing and the food the best we had in all of our trip, so much variety and everything so tasty. We ate so much at breakfast we didn’t need lunch and in the evenings we still struggled to fit in more food. 

We had planned to go outside of the hotel and explore but we were so comfy, happy and relaxed after our week touring that we decided to just enjoy the hotel, the weather, the turtles swimming just off shore, the lizards and crabs running about, and the bats flying around at night. Oh and there was a massive grass snake on day 1, plus some noisy crows. 

We did have to venture to the local Registry Office to apply for our wedding licence. Again, Gayani arranged all of this for us. Her driver picked us up and Gayani met us there… on her day off.  This was quite an exciting & interesting part of the experience of getting married overseas.

Our wedding day involved a lovely breakfast and a couples massage in the spa. My wife-to-be said it was one of the best massages she’s ever had. I’ll be honest I think the wedding nerves were kicking in and I struggled to relax. My partner was then treated to two hours of hair & make-up whilst I was given a spare room to relax & get ready in. Some of the minibar may have been consumed to calm the nerves. At a very reasonable extra cost we paid for dancers & drummers who collected me at reception and paraded me through the hotel and on to the beach.  It was then my partners turn.  The sun was shining, it was just about bearable in the heat, the whole hotel had a wedding show just for them and everything was simply amazing. Maybe we should have googled Sri Lankan weddings a bit more before the day, but I think the surprise of everything made it 10x betting, especially when two young girls appeared out of nowhere and started singing – we both had to hold back some tears. After the ceremony on the beach we signed the wedding certificates, shared out some cake and popped some champagne. We headed to the bar and then to the Duo restaurant which was the perfect end to an unforgettable day! 

Thank you, especially to Gayani, for the wedding of a lifetime. Not only would I highly recommend staying at the Fortress Resort & Spa but I would highly recommend getting married here as well.","Thank you for the wedding of a lifetime.","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r996760729-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1160","415960459","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/cb/0d/8b/dancfrench.jpg","1160","142","285","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancfrench","dancfrench","400BC6928430BDB7FF40B081D0099F65",,"186291","Stroud, United Kingdom","Stroud","dancfrench"

Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The Galle Fort Hotel.  We are so sorry to read that you disliked the bed in the Admiral Cheng Ho suite; it is an antique, and clearly we need to invest some more attention in restoring it to its former comfort, so thank you for letting us know.  With regards to the noise from the rooms upstairs, we do ask guests to be mindful, as with a heritage building, there are limitations to what we can do structurally.  Again, however, thank you for letting us know; we will see if there is a way we can insulate the floor of the room to muffle sound filtering through to the rooms below.

That aside, we are thrilled that the food and service met your expectations, and will share your words with the team.  Hopefully you will visit Sri Lanka again some day soon.","1280","774845794","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/2f/35/62/caption.jpg","964","1280","774845795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/2f/35/63/caption.jpg","964","1280","774845796","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/2f/35/64/caption.jpg","964","1280","774845797","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/2f/35/65/caption.jpg","964","2016","774845798","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/2f/35/66/caption.jpg","1134",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"28 Church Street, Galle 80000 Sri Lanka","Galle","Sri Lanka","80000",,"28 Church Street","","556080","6.026645","Galle, Galle District, Southern Province","80.21746","Galle Fort Hotel","1100","4.5","27","18","79","215","761","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297896-d556080-Reviews-Galle_Fort_Hotel-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html","http://www.galleforthotel.com/","2024-11-21","MOBILE","4","Avoid the Admiral Cheng Ho suite if you want to be able to sleep!

The Good
The arrival was smooth and easy - we had a great first impression of the resort and room. The staff were very welcoming and had setup the villa nicely - also with a crib for our daughter. We also had a few bookings in the spa - highly recommend the masseuse and his treatments.

The Bad & Ugly
Unfortunately one can only book a room with breakfast. Furthermore, the Christmas and New Years Eve dinners were mandatory - the prices charged were excessive for the service and food quality offered. There was an issue every time for opening hours (they were never ready for breakfast!), communicating the buffet time for Christmas eve - we entirely missed out on the BBQ as they said that the BBQ and buffet would close at 11pm - yet it closed at 10pm! As soon as the restaurant was at half capacity, the service and food delivery would slow down significantly - we would end up wasting a lot of time waiting to order and then waiting for the food to arrive. Even for simple orders such as a tea - delivery time would be in excess of 30 minutes! The BBQ was overrated - the food was pre-cooked and then they just threw it onto the grill to re-heat it (with the exception of the lobster) - the calamary was as chewy as a shoe-sole / simply not eatable - when I mentioned it to the executive chef (who was busy with everything but overseeing the kitchen and grill operation), he gave an impolite 'this is Sri Lankan calamary' - this response and lack of care makes absolutely no sense! Furthermore, the gala dinner buffet was served in the hot restaurant space (AC clearly did not work), which makes it unsanitary for any raw food items and allow for bacteria to develop - especially on the raw fish items. Even the staff were sweating and struggling in the hot and humid restaurant space - luckily all the seating was outside.
By the end of our trip, we frequently ended up going next door to the Marriott for breakfast, lunch and dinner - the prices were similar, the service was way better and we even got breakfast and a few other meals comped.

Conclusion
You can stay here and have a good time, as long as you pay for room only and do not go to the restaurant - unless you want to waste time, money and eat shoe-soles.","We had an amazing stay; however, avoid the restaurant!","2021-12","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d654256-r825823173-Weligama_Bay_Resort-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"3024","652535239","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/e4/e5/c7/ck71717.jpg","3024","51","28","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ck71717","Christian K","C2CB4B7B6FC3EDCA277C9F83272894CB",,"187323","Berlin, Germany","Berlin","ck71717"

It was easy to organize trips from there
In spite that ocean relatively shallow, we were swimming each day and jumped in waves
We will come back !","Very pleasant place, high quality hotel and very good for relaxation","2022-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d654256-r825593829-Weligama_Bay_Resort-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1958olda","1958olda","006E5388C0E6949FE52C957ABEDE8D3E",,,,,"1958olda"

Thank you for your review although and sadly it is not so positive as others we got previously.
We are sorry that our breakfast buffet didn´t meet your expectation but we always consider the vegetarian option as well so that our breakfast buffet always includes meals such dhal, those, cereals, fruits etc. Also, if we are informed about any allergies or special meal guest´s requests in advance, we always try to be prepared. 
You stayed with us one night on 28th December when the hotel was fully occupied and restaurant quite busy. Of course, it is not excuse for being served with delay, but we must say that the system is ""the first come the first gets meal"" in the restaurant. Only if the meal request longer time to be prepared then the guests coming later might be served earlier.
We apology for the small defect in the washbasin as there was a crack in ceramic. This has no effect for the washbasin usage and was damaged by previous guest. It is not easy to find the same ceramic in Sri Lanka these days and our receptionist forget to announce this defect to you during check-in time.
We wish you all the best in 2022.
With best regards,
Dinesh Karunarathne

The grounds of the hotel were really nice, we could see lots of monkeys everywhere playing in the trees and a few peacocks running around. The pool was soo nice and relaxing and the food was super!

Throughout our stay the staff did everything in their power to make sure we had a great time.

We also booked in for spa treatments, and it was the best the staff were so professional and were able to help and give advice to help my shoulder and back pain. The best spa treatment I’ve ever had.

We would like to give a special shout out to the staff that took care of us: Dulshan, Feros, Ashan, Rasika, Damitn, Dananjaya and a special thanks to the Resident manager, Dinusha Goonasena for specially helping our family during our stay.

The grounds are very well kept. The pool is gorgeous and super clean. Be sure to ask for cushions for the chairs. 

The food was delicious. We got half board and ate breakfast and dinner here. The array of desserts is amazing. All of the staff is friendly and ready to help. 

As a bonus, there’s lots of beautiful wildlife here. On the way to check out this morning I saw langurs and an orange kitty. We also saw macaques, peacocks, and lots of cute dogs.

Although it wasn't the most luxurious of the 13 days I spent in sri lanka, it compensated in genuine customer svc. The view from the rooms view all the way to the ocean but also show the pool and grounds. I believe I was on 2nd or 3rd floor. I had half board here so I ate dinner here, the options was shellfish for fish. I explained to them I cannot eat, they made a exception and offered tuna and seerfish, a local fish, it was cooked to perfection . I had to have it again the next evening. 

The waiter in the restaurant,  it was his last day there because he was doing his internship there was the most respectful down to earth human I met in the entire trip , I can't remember his name but he will go on to greatness. I'm in restaurant mgmt myself. I gave him some pointers. The fruit plate they offered for dessert is still in my brain 4 months later. 

The staff all across the board were so genuinely friendly and engaging. 

I recommend if you stay in mirissa, stay here. The beach is about an 1/8 of a mile , so you can get a rickshaw.

The room was very spacious, clean, and tastefully decorated.
Although we never used the swimming pool it looked clean and well maintained. The restaurant area was very pleasant with a little bridge over the hotel entrance to the buffet area. We had breakfasts here which were very tasty, a mixture of western and Sri Lankan fare. The only criticism we had was the chairs, which were quite uncomfortable.

Housekeeping team always ensure us that the room is very clean and smells very pleasant. I really love the elephant towel folding that always welcomes us from a long day. They always respond to our needs which was very convenient.

Breakfast options were great, the only thing i can say as constructive criticism was the freshness of the food. Its quite cold when served. But there was always a chef to assist you which was fantastic.

Also, the location is very close to the beach and there are many restaurants to choose from. Very good restaurants thats very affordable and serves sumptuous food.

You and your staff went out of your way to make sure that all our needs were met.

Our butler Pawan was extremely helpful and was there all the time to assist us. He was well trained and always had a smile on his face and provided exceptional service to us.

Your room boy Oshada was very friendly and made sure that our room was always clean and neat and tidy.

The food was excellent and your staff were very accommodating and allowed us to make changes without making a fuss.

The cabana was spacious and inviting. The bed was very comfortable and linen was soft and cozy!

The pool was very inviting and the water was clean and the temperature was perfect and the pool boy Ajith was very friendly.

This resort really lives up to its name: it's a paradise for families, nature lovers, and anyone who needs some peace and quiet in nature.

We were warmly welcomed as soon as we got there. Oh, it was unforgettable: it was traditional, elegant, and felt personal. It was amazing that they put a sash around our necks, which we got to keep as a nice keepsake. I think Team Occidental truly lives up to hospitality. 

The chalets were big and well-kept, and they were comfortable because they were in a beautiful natural setting. We loved waking up to the sound of birds and seeing peacocks walking around the grounds. It was like living in a nature documentary!

The pool area was great because it had separate areas for adults and kids. Our kids had a great time. Another great thing was the in-room dining. It was tasty, easy, and served with care.

There was a lot of food, it was different, and it was all very good. There was food for everyone, from local favorites to kid-friendly choices.

But the hospitality was what really stood out. We've stayed at a lot of places, but this team was the best. The Resident Manager and the General Manager both came to see us in person, which was a rare and nice gesture that made us feel very important. Thanks a lot to Ashan and the rest of the team for going above and beyond.

If you’re ever heading to Dambulla, Occidental Paradise should be on your must-visit list. It's more than just a hotel; it's the best way to experience Sri Lankan hospitality, nature, and warmth.

Special thanks to Ruwan (group accounts manager) for helping me out with the last-minute reservation.

Also the pool/garden attendants,Nuwan and Udul who made sure we were comfortable in the gardens and around the pool.The jacuzzi bath in the Ocean view room was also a treat.Its easy to get into Galle from the hotel by Tuk Tuk as they are stationed opposite.
The long stretch beaches are lovely for walking along but the sea is pretty rough and not really suitable for swimming-however a few surfers were giving it a go!
If you want your own sun beds then suggest you go for the beach ground floor rooms which open out directly onto the gardens and then you can avoid the minor inconvenience of trying to secure your favourite spot by the pool first thing in the morning.

This is an excellent resort, where the friendly staff provide exceptional service.  Although the hotel advertises that it has three restaurants, most guests had dinner in Whites, the main restaurant, which has an extensive a la carte menu, as well as a daily menu with a smaller number of dishes for those like us who were on half board.  The food was of the highest quality, and as always when we are in Sri Lanka, we mostly ate the local dishes.  Although we have visited the country many times, and enjoyed countless rice and curry dinners, we were delighted to be served some vegetable curries here that we had not previously encountered.  The open sided bar is a good place to have a drink while watching the sun set.  In the day, time can be spent relaxing on a sun lounger, keeping an eye open for the turtles that come at high tide, but there are also many interesting things to do in the vicinity.   Just across the road is an interesting cultural museum dedicated to the work of the writer Martin Wickramasinghe, that includes exhibits related to rural life in Sri Lanka, and a very restful Buddhist temple within walking distance on an island in the nearby Koggala lake. We like using local transport and took the train or bus to both Galle and Weligama, both within half an hour of the hotel.  The excellent service and the beautiful surroundings make this an ideal resort to spend time enjoying Sri Lankan hospitality at its best.","A beautiful resort near Galle","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r994960534-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","3","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore728463","David and Janet","17C7AFEA3A79D8F882C9B14AA800C7C4",,"186370","Bath, United Kingdom","Bath","Explore728463"

Our room was a beach room and it opened up onto the pool with the beach just beyond. I loved being able to open the patio doors and having sun loungers just there. The pool staff were phenomenal, they saw you before you even had a chance to look for them and arranged the loungers exactly how and where you prefer. The restaurant was brilliant, Samantha and the team really made us feel welcome and greeted us everyday by our names. We ate in White most days but tried out the teppanyaki (brilliant) as well as the restaurant in the wine cellar - Duo. All the food was superb and there’s a wide choice, the Sri Lankan food was super tasty. There is a buffet on Saturdays which guests, not in the hotel, come to so that should show how good it is but they’re willing to cook you anything should you not want the buffet. My husband and I both had spa treatments which we enjoyed, the spa itself is a little dated and it backs onto the main road so you can hear horns beeping whilst having your treatment which was, sadly, not very relaxing. The only other odd and slightly negative thing was in the afternoon whilst by the pool a large number of crows always appeared trying to drink from the pool. The team did attempt to get rid of them but used a sonar detector which omitted a very high pitched noise and didn’t deter the crows - again not very relaxing. That wouldn’t stop us going back, it was one of the most relaxing hotels I’ve been to in a long time. Galle is about 30mins away and the hotel can arrange transport for you. If you like to go in the sea then be warned it’s very rough outside the hotel, we attempted a couple of times but the current is very strong. There were a large number of trainees either serving by the pool, in the bar or in the restaurant - all of them excellent. As well as Samantha, I would like to mention Sashan who looked after our drinks orders night and day! We will definitely be back","Fabulous hotel and brilliant staff","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r992739202-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"960","371091493","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/1e/68/25/886karenp.jpg","960","45","108","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/886karenjl","Karen Langton","00598D249C4DEE14016C8284FC94A0D3",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","886karenjl"

Everything suited us perfectly.  We had a suite on the ground floor (room 06) which was a few metres from the most fantastic pool.  The rooms were clean, large and well thought out.  The shower was superb as were the shampoos and body products.  We loved the easiness of being able to access the room from the pool.  This hotel only being 50 rooms, there were enough people to create a nice atmosphere but everything (spa, gym and restaurant were within such close proximity.  

It’s extremely well maintained and so very friendly and personable.  Every single member of staff, from chefs (yes we were given a tour of the kitchens of which they are rightly proud!) to the pool staff were just amazing, although I have to say that all Sri Lankans both inside and outside the hotel are delightful and obliging people.  This hotel has 450 full time staff….yes thats a ratio of 4.5 members of staff to every guest so that gives you a clue as to the attention you receive at The Fortress.  At this point I need to highlight ‘Sam’ one of the restaurant managers and ‘Weena’, one of the spa therapists who both went above and beyond, but in all honestly they were all fantastic.

The food was exceptional, both breakfast and dinner (the buffet on a Saturday night is not to be missed)!!  Again service was second to none.

On a very small negative note, the spa could definately upgrade their products (they don’t do gel nails, which may sound minor to any men reading this, but as I’d broken two nails on second day into my holiday it was a right nuisance)!!  I also think they are missing. a trick not having lovely ayuredivic products for sale despite them having a wall of glass display cabinets in the spa with nothing in!  People love to take a few presents and momentos back home with them  and myself and my cousin would love to have purchased gifts  but apart from the little boutique shop which was unfortunately not particularly exciting with nothing desiresble in there (personally I’d close it or completely start again and make it more upmarket ) there was nothing I wanted to bring back home.  As I said these are very minor points and the massages far outweighed the fact they didn’t sell products.

During the course of our two weeks we stayed in four different five star establishments and all very different in their own unique style (the KK Beach, The Galle Face and the kahanda kanda) but for overall  quality, service, food, pool, beach and value for money it is The Fortress hotel and spa that we will be booking for this time next year.  Thank you for making our holiday a truly memorable one….in spite of the copious amounts of rain!!!","Great start to our holiday at The Fortress","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r991675542-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390050","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless58502733021","Debbie R","2B761DC9B29532191E8500CECC0EEEB0",,,,,"Fearless58502733021"

Lovely and pleasant staff with full of smiles, we got a nice welcome drink during check in and they got our lunch order then and there itself. 

We enjoyed the pool, the room was comfy and it had all the necessary amenities included. Air con was excellent. We had a set menu for lunch and breakfast. 

This place is great to stay over if you want to get a sneak peak at Coconut Tree Hill. A nice 5 minute walk from the hotel. We went there at sunrise and it was absolutely amazing.

The hotel is new and modern, with friendly and professional staff.  I just loved our room which was the end room on the third floor.  It felt so luxurious with stunning décor.   

We were just a short walk from Coconut Hill and Turtle Point where you can see lots of turtles and have great views.  We were staying in Mirissa to go blue whale watching and scuba diving.  Unfortunately, the tours were cancelled due to Covid restrictions.   We took a tuk tuk as close as we could to Secret Beach, where we had a good time snorkelling.  

There are many restaurants walking distance or a short tuk tuk ride, but we ended up eating at the hotel restaurant most nights because it was clean and offered great food and service.

While be confined to the hotel we were still able to photograph many lovely birds, giant squirrels, palm squirrels, and black purple face langur monkeys.

I couldn’t praise the staff more for the way they looked after us during the Covid restrictions and quickly increased there already high hygiene standards.

Nous avons souvent voyagé et même dans les hôtels dits de luxe, la qualité de la restauration est souvent catastrophique. Ce n’est pas le cas ici, le petit déjeuner est divin, et le restaurant principal est vraiment délicieux, nous avons testé plusieurs plats à la carte et n’avons jamais été déçus. 
Tout est d’une grande propreté. 
L’hôtel était, pour nous, idéalement placé à proximité des plages de surf et non loin de Galle, Unawatuna, Kabalana, Ahangama et autres villages où nous pouvions nous rendre très facilement en tuk tuk. 
La plage a gauche de l’hôtel est paradisiaque pour s’y promener et s’y baigner.

The most wonderful time at the most wonderful time of year.
The views as you walk through the enormous wooden gates are fantastic.
Beautiful hotel, fabulous food, amazing staff, brilliant atmosphere, the superlatives dont even come close to describing reality.
We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite - a treat to ourselves as it had a few extras and we had a patio as well as a balcony, but all the rooms were amazing. Our bed was the most comfortable we had ever had in a hotel - and I mean that !!!
Each night our bed was turned down but I insisted on opening the blinds - if I woke up I could still see and hear the sea from our bed.
We stayed on an all inclusive package - we had everything we could possibly wish for. Each day breakfast was a mix of English, continental, fresh fruit, traditional Sri Lankan, delicious local breads, with hot stations serving waffles (if thats your thing), eggs cooked to order, but my favourite, Hoppers and Egg Hoppers.
The infinity pool was brilliant, never too busy, and with views out into the waves.
The staff around the pool were amazing - nothing was too much trouble and we always enjoyed sharing family stories with the team.
We rarely had lunch (breakfast was too amazing).
Evenings started with a cocktail followed by the most amazing dinner fare. Sri Lankan, soup, salads, sushi, anti pasti, seafood cocktails and a grill station with the most mazing seafood. Wonderful wines - the list goes on.
Outside the hotel, the traffic had a beautiful chaos about it - pedestrians and cyclists alongside Tuk-Tuks, cars, trucks and buses - oh the buses challenging tuk tuks to that space ahead but with respect from both sides - we should adopt that attitude in the UK.
We had a list of experiences before we arrived and the hotel staff helped us achieve everything we had wished for - and a whole lot more.
Our sincere thanks to our drivers Subash and Ashintha.
Udawalewe National Park with our friend Subash. A fantastic day with elephants.
On Christmas Eve we had a walk around Galle Fort, Lion Beer in The Ivy, then back at the hotel we saw Santa who presented gifts to all the children before an amazing gala dinner.
Our Christmas Day was wonderful - after breakfast we walked along the amazing beach from the hotel - almost nobody on the beach. We visited the turtle sanctuary - baby turtles seem so helpless.....
Boxing Day was the 20th anniversary of the devastating tsunami and we were humbled to visit the tsunami memorial and statue at Hikkaduwa with our driver Ashintha. We shed many tears for the people of Sri Lanka.
The next day was an early start with Subash as we went to Ella via 9 arch bridge. Then a train ride from Ella to Bandarawela in an open carriage, then onto Liptons seat and ending the day hiking to and swimming in the pools at Upper Diyaluma Falls - an absolutely wonderful day.
Our next adventure was whale watching - wow. A speed boat out to the whales, we saw a Blue whale and mum and baby Fin whales. After we  fished from the boat and caught a tuna!! We walked from Mirissa harbour along the beach towards Coconut Hill - the perfect end to a perfect day.
Next adventure was a boat trip on Kogalla lake - what a fantastic experience. We saw crocodiles, beautiful birds, the biggest monitor lizard we have ever seen and we fed fruit to monkeys.
New Years Eve was a wonderful gala with amazing food, a band and superb fireworks on the beach and on New Years Day we were honoured to take part in the Buddhist New Year blessing - THANK YOU.
Our last trip was to Sigiriya - an amazing place with amazing views.
Our most humble thanks to Subash, Ashintha and all the staff at The Fortress Hotel and Spa. Too many to name individually but you gave us so much pleasure and fun - you know who you are.
My special thanks to the Bar Team - I hope I brought some fun to evenings.
Above all else our special thanks to a wonderful lady - Chamindi, you made our stay so perfect - thank you so so much to you.
THANK YOU - we hope we can visit again in the future and to anyone reading this review - Sri Lanka is beautiful, the people of Sri Lanka are beautiful - need I say more.
Love to everyone at the Fortress Hotel and Spa

Absolutely stunning property with well appointed rooms. All rooms except The Fortress rooms overlook the ocean. We had the Ocean room and Beach room. Bathrooms well lit and plenty of space. His and her sinks, large shower and jacuzzi bath tub. Choice of pillows options too.. sheer luxury!

Food is of top quality. Chef Asela made sure of that and that our dietary requirements were met… vegan, veg and non veg.All the dishes were excellent and tasty.

Breakfast catered for all palates. A good selection to choose from. There was variety of fruit juices ,curries, Continental food,breads, pastries,omelettes, Hoppers, Sri Lankan dishes …very spoilt for choice.

Management, especially Nadeesha made our stay so comfortable. Always greeted us with a huge welcoming smile.Nothing was too much for her.All our concerns were addressed.

The property itself is very well maintained. Pool is beautiful as are the grounds.

During our stay we made such good friends with everyone that it felt like they were part of our family…it was sad to leave.

We stayed in an Ocean Loft Suite, which was absolutely huge, spanning two floors and featuring a spacious indoor plunge pool. The addition of a dedicated butler made the experience even more special.

The room was incredibly spacious, well-lit, soundproofed, and equipped with all the amenities we needed. Although we encountered a minor issue with the electricals, the technical team promptly resolved it. The plunge pool was a highlight for us, with the water maintained slightly above ambient temperature—perfect for us and our child, who thoroughly enjoyed it too.

As always, the food was excellent. We opted for breakfast at the resort and tried in-room dining, which, though slightly more expensive than on our previous visits (likely due to exchange rates), was still worth it for the quality and convenience.

The service was impeccable, with attentive and helpful staff who made our visit truly memorable. This level of hospitality is what keeps bringing us back. The Fortress Resort remains the only place in Sri Lanka that we’ve visited multiple times—and it has consistently surpassed our expectations.

We can’t wait to return for another exceptional stay!","A Perfect Stay, Every Time: Our Favorite Sri Lankan Getaway","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1189030-d601108-r983491574-The_Fortress_Resort_Spa-Koggala_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"50","196170900","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/b1/54/94/dinesh-c.jpg","50","1","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181dineshc","Dinesh C","2BF500255C354FE76033C05517C1A26B",,,,,"181dineshc"
