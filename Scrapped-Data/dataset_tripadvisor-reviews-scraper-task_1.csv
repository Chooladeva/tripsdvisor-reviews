The view, the food and the excellent service... and the rooftop bar.
And the infinity pool.
OK so this hotel has a lot going for it.

We'd booked in advance and paid a little extra for a (what we interpreted as) better room. We were a little disappointed to discover our family room was on the sub-level. Once we spoke to the reception they understood and installed us into a top floor room with amazing views over Kandy.
The food is great here. Chef will come out and say hello during dinner service. Breakfast is also excellent and swift.
Make sure you get a chance to enjoy the pool. Being on the edge of the world and looking into the busy green city is not to be missed. The pool is small and cute and only a few loungers so you need to be friendly with your fellow guests.
Also make sure to enjoy the evening sunset views from the rooftop bar. The music is good, the barmen are good, the vibe is good. It's just a good time!

Highly recommend this hotel for families and saw many couples enjoying it too.

Make sure you tip the bellboy. He's a good dude.

The rooms have international plugs, AC, minibar, hairdryers etc... the bathrooms have toiletries and everything you need.
Definitely get a tuktuk or taxi as its up a big hill.

It was good location to Kandy we happily walked down to Kandy and caught a Tuk Tuk back. We were on a dinner bed and breakfast rate, where the food was good the brownie we had one night was particularly tasty. 
The staff were attentive and the hotel was generally well kept and very pleasant. The smell in our room was very odd though, like a powerful cleaning smell. I’ve never had a problem with room smells before so found this odd! So much so that whilst in the room we had the patio door open and didn’t have any room service the following day to avoid it heightening any more.

The location is great, really peaceful, with lovely views of the hills, which makes for a relaxing atmosphere. The staff is friendly and welcoming, but sometimes a bit slow to respond to requests, which can be a little frustrating when you need something quickly.

The room I stayed in was decent, but could use a little updating. It felt a bit dated, and the bathroom had some minor issues, like low water pressure and inconsistent hot water. However, the bed was comfy, and the air conditioning worked well, which is always a plus.

The food was good, though not mind-blowing. It’s solid enough, but I’d suggest stepping up the variety a bit.

Hotel is located directly across an active large construction site so is both very noisy and unsightly at the moment and foreseeable future. Communication with staff is inconsistent and difficult. Was told by 2 employees I would have no problem amending my booking and receiving a refund. Had my booking company contact the hotel multiple times to do this and the hotel denied my request to change dates. After expressing my dissatisfaction to the front desk staff regarding the contradicting information I was told a manager would reach out to me. This never happened and they never attempted to speak to me at all. The worst hotel customer service I’ve experienced across multiple continents. The hotel also does not allow even a single guest into the hotel, which was not visible anywhere on the booking or on their own website.

It was better than in every way - rooms were cleaner and felt fresher, the service was friendlier etc. I had recommended this hotel to family. We returned to the hotel this weekend, together with relatives who also booked a stay. We stayed in a room for three adults on the 4th floor. It was an oddly configured layout but aside from that the AC units didn’t work - they kept shutting off during the night and then spluttering back to life loudly - so loud that we woke up multiple times in the night every time it restarted. Probably about 8 or 9 times during the night! One of the units was also malfunctioning to the point that it was spraying out a fine mist of water (sounds nicer than it was) so one of our bags On the floor beneath the unit it was damp the whole time until we realised. Our relatives on the 6th floor reported the same issues with their room plus a blocked bathroom sink. On check-out, the staff were perfectly pleasant but didn’t even ask how our stay was. The service this time around was generally lacking. Thankfully we only booked to stay two nights. I won’t return or recommend going forward.","It used to be great, now not worth it.

Such a pleasant person with exceptional service. The front desk staff was very accommodating of our strange scheduled stay, as we spent our first and third week in Sri Lanka at this hotel. We are very grateful for the arrangements they made for us. 

My one gripe is that the one time we really wanted to order indoor dining/room service, as I was not feeling well from a long day of being out. It took a long time for the staff to bring up the QR code for me to even order food, and that’s after I had to call a second time 20ish minutes later to see if they’d brought it. By the time I ordered and was told it would be there in 20 minutes, almost an hour and a half passed, in which I was not really hungry by that point. Other than that, I would certainly stay here again and for an extended stay.","Coming Back!","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1015335960-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388586","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26kcd","Kc D","C702FB87A5F4661181DF8750FEB8DCDB",,,,,"26kcd"

The breakfast buffet was absolutely delicious—so many options to choose from. The egg bar was great for getting eggs just the way you like them, and both the omelette and scrambled eggs were spot on.

We also dined at a couple of the hotel’s restaurants and enjoyed everything we tried. The Churros Café was especially fun—we had some cake and samosas there, and both were fresh and tasty.

Beyond the food, the room itself was very comfortable. The bed was super cozy and the pillows were great too—just the right amount of support. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained, which made the whole stay feel relaxing and easy.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka, from June 11 to June 16, 2025. While I had high expectations based on the hotel's reputation, my experience fell short in several key areas.

Check-In Experience: Upon arrival, the check-in process was relatively smooth; however, I was disappointed to find that the hotel could not accommodate the specific room I had originally opted for. This was my first indication that my stay might not meet my expectations.

Laundry Service Discrepancy: The most significant issue arose during my checkout. I had received a confirmed email outlining the room tariff, which included 4 pieces of laundry per day. Given my 5-night stay, I was entitled to a total of 20 pieces of laundry. Unfortunately, I did not utilize the laundry service during the first three days of my stay. However, on the 4th and 5th days, I submitted 13 pieces and 7 pieces of laundry, respectively.

At checkout, the billing staff initially requested payment for all 20 pieces of laundry. Subsequently, I was informed that I was only eligible for 8 pieces, as the hotel staff claimed that my lack of usage during the first three days limited my entitlement. Despite my attempts to clarify the situation and present the confirmed inclusion in my tariff, the staff remained unyielding and dismissive. As a result, I was compelled to pay for 12 pieces of laundry, amounting to LKR 5139.00, in addition to an extra USD 45 for the inclusion of the laundry service.

Staff Conduct: I must also address the demeanor of the front office staff during this encounter. Their attitude was not only unwelcoming but also hostile, which exacerbated an already frustrating situation. This lack of professionalism is concerning, especially for a hotel of your standing, and it detracts from the overall guest experience.

Conclusion: While Kingsbury Hotel is well-regarded among both local and international guests, my experience has raised concerns about the rigidity of staff policies and the overall guest service. I believe that addressing these issues is crucial not only for the hotel's reputation but also for the positive image of Sri Lanka as a travel destination.

I hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration to improve future guest experiences. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Kaustav Das","Feedback on My Recent Stay at Kingsbury Hotel, Sri Lanka","2025-06","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1013414555-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452387345","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg","1200","11","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaustav_das04","Kaustav D","920D66C559DCF263F0E02D553F3420A1",,,,,"kaustav_das04"

So, when I came to Sri Lanka on vacation, I was happy to stay at this hotel during the days I planned to spend in Colombo. The rooms are very nice and clean, and have everything you need. The hotel is located centrally in Colombo and has easy access to all major destinations which is a huge benefit. 

Over a period of 3 weeks, I stayed at the hotel for about 7 nights as I was travelling away from Colombo frequently. The staff was friendly and supportive. Niroshan and Rushani from the front desk were especially very helpful in my encounters with them. I thank them for their kind hospitality. Secondly, the food in the restaurant is also some of the best food I've had. Definitely recommend the room service here. 

One of the only things that I could suggest as an improvement is to have larger water bottles in the room. We ran out of the bottles quite regularly and had to call up housekeeping to refill them multiple times (to which they happily obliged, which is great!) 

All in all, ME Colombo is definitely good value for money. You also get access to a rooftop infinity pool and a bar. I was able to host a couple of my friends at the rooftop bar for a nice cold beer as well. P.S. The view of the Colombo skyline from the rooftop is amazing. You can also get this view with most of their Superior rooms. 

By this point, I was starting to feel like it was home. However, I tried checking in for another time (8th night in 3 weeks if my memory is accurate) but did not have the best experience. Maybe it's my fault that I didn't make a reservation. My plans are always so sudden, so I couldn't manage to book anything before. Regardless, when I arrived at the hotel to try and check in, I was given very conflicting information and potentially treated unfairly. I arrived a little earlier than the check-in time. The receptionist at the time communicated to me that I could get a room a little later once some of the guests check out and the rooms are cleaned. I was happy to wait and even offered my card to finalise the payment. She even said that she will try to get the room arranged for me sooner for an early check-in. At that point, she had to contact the manager to get the authorisation for a special rate that was offered to me since I was planning to come back multiple times during my 6-week stay in Sri Lanka. The manager then came in and checked some things, and suddenly told me that there is no availability. Was it because he didn't want to oblige to the rate I had before when the hotel had low occupancy and it was at high occupancy at the time? Or was it because I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt with flip flops because I drove all the way from Kandy? Or maybe it was a miscommunication and a misunderstanding. Regardless, it didn't feel right to us. Ultimately, we ended up going to a different hotel that we quite enjoyed","Great place and a very enjoyable stay.

The rooftop pool and bar are absolutely stunning! It’s the perfect place to enjoy a beautiful view while sipping on a refreshing drink.

A special thank you goes out to Mr. Rilwan, the Front Office Manager, for leading such a fantastic team. Every interaction with Aruna, Sithumini, Rushani, and our all-time favorite Niroshan is a pleasure — they consistently go above and beyond to check in on us and make our stay memorable.

Also, a huge shoutout to Gopi from housekeeping, who always adds that extra special touch to our room, and Suraj from the restaurant, who never fails to serve up amazing cocktails with a smile.

We recently enjoyed a wonderful 3-night stay at Cinnamon Bentota Beach, and it was truly a memorable experience from start to finish. The setting is stunning, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the service throughout the hotel was excellent.

A very special mention must go to Chef Mark Selvaraj, who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. His personal attention, warm hospitality, and outstanding culinary skills truly stood out. Every meal prepared under his guidance was a delight – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. It’s rare to come across someone who is not only passionate about their craft but also genuinely cares about the guests’ experience.

Chef Mark’s thoughtful touches and willingness to cater to our preferences made us feel incredibly well looked after. He was a true highlight of our stay and left a lasting impression.

Our kids absolutely loved the large pool and kids’ club – they had a blast while we enjoyed some much-needed relaxation time.

However, I felt that the buffet could use more variety and refinement to match the hotel’s star rating and especially other Cinnamon properties. And it would be better if bathing area in room can be locked from inside when we staying with kids.

We also had some great conversations with a pool staff member and someone from the marketing team. They shared that they had either visited Switzerland before or had family there, which made the exchange even more enjoyable.

The only downside to our stay was the experience with a young man at the reception. He gave us incorrect information regarding the full-board option and then acted as if it wasn’t a big deal. In general, the reception staff didn’t seem as friendly or welcoming as the rest of the team.","We can recommend it","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r1014108016-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Pro.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trail0vicm","Maria","C35F291DE304F09AE68CBF66163F0F0A",,"188045","Switzerland","Switzerland","trail0vicm"

This resort was remarkable from start to finish. 
From the spacious rooms with amazing balconies, the incredible pools and tasty food from the buffets. The selection and authentic dishes were a treat at every meal we had. Even preparing a dish we wanted to try which was lovely (Sri Lankan crab curry). 
By far the best experience was the truly caring and friendly staff which made our trip incredible. 
Be sure to also walk along the beach and do the architecture tour which is very informative.

Thank you so much for your beautiful words and for sharing such a heartfelt review. It truly means the world to us. We’re so glad you enjoyed your stay, the food, and the peaceful comfort of the hotel.

It was a very special time in Kandy, and we’re deeply touched that you chose to be part of the moment with us. Seeing guests like you join in with such kindness and generosity reminded us of the real spirit of hospitality. We’re honoured it became a memory you’ll always carry with you — it certainly is one we’ll never forget.

We hope to welcome you back to The Radh one day. Until then, thank you again for your warmth and generosity.

With gratitude,

We got a lovely welcome, the room was extremely comfortable and quiet and the food delicious. Lovely breakfast and very good choice of meals at lunch and dinner, both western and Asian. 

We spent just 2 nights at this lovely hotel, not knowing when we booked that it would be the special temple of the tooth event, with hundreds and thousands of Sri Lanka people queuing for miles to see the Buddha’s tooth. This event happens once in a generation so the atmosphere in Kandy was incredible. The hotel is very close to the temple complex and the queue was literally right outside.

We were touched when the staff asked us to help prepare meals for the people queuing, we had quite a production line going loading the Dahl, rice and curry into parcels and then it was an absolute privilege to help hand the meals out. Everyone got involved and the owner of the hotel was there with his family. It was an evening that I will never forget.

Thank you so much to all the lovely staff at the 
Radh you are fantastic and we hope to see you again soon.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. We truly appreciate guests who care enough to let us know where we’ve fallen short — it’s how we learn and grow.

We’re genuinely sorry to hear that your dining experience didn’t meet expectations. We understand how frustrating it must have been to feel misled by the final bill. Our menus do include a note about the applicable service charge and government taxes, but we realize this can still come as a surprise, especially when the final total feels significantly higher than the listed prices. With recent changes in regulations, we’ve had to adjust accordingly, and we are currently in the process of updating our menus to ensure more clarity and transparency for our guests.

As for the service delays during your meal, and the multiple reminders needed for table water — we apologise sincerely. That is not the level of attentiveness we aim for. Whether the hotel was unusually busy that day or not, every guest deserves a smooth and thoughtful dining experience.

We also hear your concerns regarding the room service and housekeeping system. It’s possible the automated panel may have been activated unknowingly, and we apologise for not explaining this feature better at check-in. We understand how important privacy is, and we’ll be looking into how we can make this process more intuitive and better communicated.

On a positive note, we’re glad that the room met your expectations in terms of cleanliness and presentation, and that you appreciated our central location. Your point about the small step near the bathroom has been taken seriously — safety is non-negotiable, and we’ll ensure it’s looked into promptly.

Thank you once again for sharing your thoughts. Feedback like yours helps us reflect and improve. We hope you’ll consider staying with us again and give us the opportunity to offer the seamless and thoughtful experience we strive for.","2000","798944790","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/9e/ee/16/caption.jpg","934","2000","798944791","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/9e/ee/17/caption.jpg","934",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30 Colombo Street, Kandy 20000 Sri Lanka","Kandy","Sri Lanka","20000",,"30 Colombo Street",,"15149838","7.29415","Kandy, Kandy District, Central Province","80.63873","The Radh","342","4.5","6","7","19","74","236","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304138-d15149838-Reviews-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html","http://www.theradh.com","2025-04-16","OTHER","2","Beware of a 34% ( Service charge, VAT, TDL, SSCL) extra fee applied to the services request at the premises","Value","3","Rooms","3","Location","5","Cleanliness","4","Service","2","Sleep Quality","4","Food:

This was unexpected and disappointing. On the same day, we dined at another nearby hotel with a similar rating, and no such excessive charges were applied. The discrepancy felt unreasonable and left a negative impression.

Service during the meal was also below expectations. The dishes were served at staggered intervals, and by the time the final item arrived, some children had already finished their meals, making it difficult to share food as intended. Additionally, we had to request table water three times before it was finally provided. Overall, the dining service was unsatisfactory.

Room Service:
The hotel appears to operate a room service system, but no explanation was provided at check-in. We had to leave the room hurriedly around 6:00 PM to attend temple rituals. Upon returning, we discovered that the room had been cleaned in our absence—without any request from us or prior notice. This raised concerns about privacy and a lack of communication.

It is possible that their advanced system may have been triggered accidentally—perhaps by our children touching the wall panel—sending an unintended housekeeping request. However, we were never informed how the system works, which added to the confusion and concern.

Location:
The hotel is centrally located, making it ideal for early morning temple visits. For those planning spiritual or cultural activities, the location is convenient and highly suitable.

Room:
The room was clean and well-presented, meeting general expectations. However, there was a small, easily overlooked step at the bathroom exit, posing a potential tripping hazard. This is a safety concern that should be addressed by hotel management as a priority.","Convenient Stay, But Menu Prices Misleading – 34% Extra Charge","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d15149838-r1002978067-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream31822494375","Dream31822494375","DDBC6A13F5EBA9BF5DA37A98A133A3A1",,,,,"Dream31822494375"

From the moment you walk in, the place gives off a clean, modern, and well-kept vibe. It's super close to the Temple of the Tooth and other key spots in Kandy, which made exploring the city really convenient.

The room was compact but well-designed, modern decor, comfortable bed, spotless bathroom, and everything worked just like it should. I especially appreciated the attention to detail, like the welcome treats and the high-quality toiletries.

The staff here are polite and professional, and they don’t hover too much, which I liked. The breakfast was impressive, good variety, fresh, and tasty. I didn’t try the spa, but I heard good things from other guests.

Only downside? Parking can be a little tight, and if you’re in a bigger vehicle, the entrance might feel a bit cramped. But overall, it’s a solid place if you're after comfort, location, and good service.","A Touch of Luxury Right in the Heart of Kandy","2024-09","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d15149838-r1002080841-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","40","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8773JBmohammeda","Aaqib","56D016A75A20BAFE44DFC1E5ABD4E26E",,"304138","Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kandy","D8773JBmohammeda"

During my stay I happened to have a laundry mishap that was not at all the fault of the Radh - and yet they took the initiative to do everything possible to take care of me.  That included sending out staff to find an almost exact match to a damaged shirt - which they did! (no small feat - an XXL in Sri Lanka!).   

Moreover, the manager in charge (Domani) took the time to pen an extraordinarily kind and personal  note which is definitely a saver.  It was a class act by the team there, and I was so very impressed.

And yet I would have still penned a 5 star review simply based on the day to day customer service at the hotel.  Chamodi, the restaurant manager, was simply wonderful.  A great smile, always a kind word, and   so very helpful.  A great aura every time she greeted me.

From the minute we entered the hotel, we were treated courteously with a welcome drink. The staff where friendly throughout our stay but at times, we did have to repeat our requests (eg. For more towels or help with luggage when we checked out). Special mention for Danush who was helpful from beginning to end. 

Our room was the Radh Royal Suite which comprised of 2 rooms. Upon our entry into the room, the staff seemed surprised by our request to use both rooms. The 1st room was very impressive, spacious with a king bed. The balcony had a hot tub (which should have been cleaned before we began our stay) with a great view of the surrounding area. Bathroom was of a high quality as well. 

The 2nd room (smaller and no way as impressive as the first) was locked and the bed was not made up. There was a damp and musky feel to this room and the staff had to clean it up before we could use it. The slight mould on the walls was an unpleasant site that ruined a part of the overall experience of the room. 

The breakfast area is also the hotel’s restaurant and the options in the morning catered to our needs. The area is rather small, with only 2 rows able to be accommodated but this did not pose an issue with us. The staff were efficient enough at breakfast and offered tea/coffee and anything else they could help with. 

Location wise, the hotel is situated near the Temple of the Tooth and Kandy Lake. Plenty of restaurants nearby and the markets are within walking distance. Lots of cars seem to be parked outside the hotel so if you are awaiting your driver, it can be bit of a task to find the driver or to wind your luggage between the cars. 

The Radh Hotel was the perfect place to locate ourselves for our part of the Sri Lanka trip that explored the cultural triangle. It would have been the perfect stay if not for some inadequacies but overall, I enjoyed my experience at the hotel.","Great location and friendly staff, but some improvements needed","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d15149838-r994507522-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"3264","316326559","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/da/c2/9f/firoz-u.jpg","2448","67","652","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firozu2018","Firoz U","20294382630F1CC0D19F98406B157940",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","firozu2018"

Dear mr line ,

Thank you for sharing your feedback. I deeply apologize for the challenges you encountered during your stay, particularly with our front desk service. Your experience does not reflect the standards we strive to uphold, and I take full responsibility for the shortcomings you faced.  

Regarding my absence, I was handling a family emergency, which prevented me from being present during your stay. However, I have personally emailed you to further explore the situation and ensure your concerns are addressed.  

I hold my team in high regard and take great pride in their dedication. Many of our guests have praised their friendliness and professionalism, which makes this incident all the more disappointing. Rest assured, we are reviewing this matter closely to identify areas for improvement and strengthen our training protocols.  

I also understand your frustration regarding the lack of alcohol availability at our hotel. While we do not serve alcohol on-site, there are several bars within a few minutes’ walking distance that our guests often enjoy. I regret that this was not communicated clearly to you during your stay.  

We would be honored to have another opportunity to welcome you back and demonstrate the level of hospitality you deserve. If you’re open to it, please reach out to me directly, and I will personally oversee your arrangements.  

Thank you again for your candor, and I hope to restore your confidence in our hotel.  

**Warm regards,**  *  
Hotel Manager

Merci d’avoir pris le temps de partager votre avis. Nous sommes désolés d’apprendre que votre séjour n’a pas été à la hauteur de vos attentes.

Les travaux en cours concernent la construction d’une piscine sur le toit, un ajout que nous espérons apprécié par nos futurs clients. Nous comprenons que cela ait pu causer quelques désagréments, et nous nous efforçons de minimiser l’impact sur nos visiteurs.

Concernant notre personnel, nous sommes surpris par votre ressenti, car notre équipe est souvent reconnue pour sa gentillesse et son hospitalité. Cependant, nous prenons votre retour très au sérieux et nous assurerons que chaque client se sente accueilli et bien pris en charge.

Nous regrettons également que notre cuisine ne vous ait pas convaincu. Vos commentaires sont précieux et nous aideront à améliorer encore nos services.

Nous espérons avoir l’opportunité de vous accueillir à nouveau et de vous offrir une expérience bien meilleure.

**Dear Dinesh 

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We sincerely apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations.  

We regret the disappointment with the deluxe family suite and any miscommunication about its features. While we’re glad we could accommodate your request for a room with a balcony, we apologize for the misunderstanding regarding the rate. We strive to be fair and transparent, and we will review this internally to ensure better clarity moving forward.  

We have noted your comments about the carpets in the common areas and are taking steps to address this as part of our ongoing improvements.  

Regarding alcohol, while we do not serve it on-site, we hope this provided an opportunity to explore the many bars within a short walking distance. We will ensure this is communicated more clearly to guests in the future.  

We’re pleased you enjoyed the coffee and dining experience, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a more seamless stay.  

Thank you for your feedback, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to discuss further.  

**Best regards,** 
Hotel Manager

The hotel refused to give us a lower rate for this room though they were on offer for much less on the day, which seemed most unfair. The carpets in the common areas looked tired.

The rooms were spacious, well-maintained, and extremely comfortable. The food was delicious, offering a variety of options, and the housekeeping service was commendable.

However, we did face some service issues. When we checked in, Mr. Abdeen, who was responsible for taking our luggage from reception to our room, refused to lift my handbag, stating that he could not carry a bag containing a water bottle. Additionally, he did not handle the luggage carefully, and my bag was nearly damaged in the process.

At the restaurant, Mr. Ashwin's behavior was disappointing. He repeatedly asked how many people were dining and the ages of the children. During final billing, he unnecessarily checked the passports multiple times for age verification. Worse still, he added extra persons to the bill assuming we wouldn’t notice, as we were a group. But we were very well aware of our count and cross-checked the bill, asking him to revise it. After being corrected, he responded by saying he would check the CCTV footage to verify, which was quite unprofessional and uncomfortable. As we were honest, he found nothing wrong.

Mr. Ashwin needs significant training in customer service and polite behavior. His attitude affected an otherwise wonderful stay.

Despite these issues, everything else—from the rooms to the food and housekeeping—was excellent. With better training for some staff members, this hotel can truly offer a flawless experience.

Would still recommend this hotel for its overall quality and amenities.","Got it!

First of all, when we came by our car, there was no doorman to open the hotel doors or even the back doors of the car. I went there in the third week of March for my best friend's birthday. We were 4 friends in total, and it was our treat for the birthday boy. To my surprise, there was no staff to ask about where Harbour Court was, since it was our first time visiting The Kingsbury. Our first choice was our usual hotel which is a luxury 5-star hotel in Colombo; I prefer not to say their name on here and it is a top ranked hotel on this platform. Yet there were no proper staff or the ones available were very busy with foreign guests. I think they have no interest in serving local Sri Lankan people, where we felt very discriminated against. After asking a person seated on the lobby chairs, who I think was a guest too, we finally found out. We went to Harbour Court. Again, they disappointed me. I made a reservation around 2 pm by calling the hotel for the dinner buffet and asked to reserve a table with a view, that means a 4-pax table near the big glass window. They told me they would surely reserve the relevant table near the window. But the girl at the restaurant reception reserved a table far away from the window and very near to the buffet, where people were busy picking food. It made us very stressed because it was crowded, and we couldn’t even have a little private conversation because people in the food queue could hear us.
OK, that is bearable, we can forgive it. But I was very amazed to see that in this kind of luxury fine dining, there are no waiters. For the whole crowded restaurant, I could find only 3 or 4 managers wearing coats who had no interest in serving guest's requirements, they were just talking and laughing with each other. I saw only one waiter in a waiter suit. We wanted cool water for our glasses after coming to the table with the food. We wanted to say this to a waiter, but there was only one waiter, and I saw maybe three people with ties and white shirts serving others, but they were busy serving the other half of the restaurant. We were wondering, where are these people who are working? These are not fake stories, and I too couldn't believe that we had to face these awful things in this kind of a luxury hotel.

Then, finally, after a few minutes of looking for anyone, a manager came. I can’t remember his name, but he was a bit bald-headed. After asking, he went to bring cold water. Then again, they failed to meet our requirement. They brought OLU water instead of normal filtered water with ice. I think the bottle costs 400 rupees, but with tax and everything, it should be around 600, I guess. The manager brought three OLU water bottles instead of what we asked; normal filtered water with ice. Is there any intention to cost guests more by making profits cunningly? We had to use these OLU bottles because if we reject them, we would have waited another half an hour looking for a waiter to bring us water. I want to mention that one of the managers came and offered us the drinks menu. One of my friends politely said we’ll order later in the eating session because we wanted to. Shockingly, this guy came again and again, insisting that we order some cocktails by being a big headache. He kept recommending different kinds of drinks, disturbing our conversations. Since it was my friend's birthday, I went to the reception girl and requested to sing happy birthday to my friend. I want to mention that on the occasion, there were other people having birthdays and two girls and one boy were singing happy birthday to them. It was unusual they were busy doing that. Somehow, even after two requests, they forgot to wish my friend. It would have made his day!!! After two requests, I stopped asking them to sing and I dropped that idea, thinking never ever coming to this hotel again, and I will not recommend it to anyone. 

I want to strictly ask that, don't you guys care about your guests??? The reason I say that is because including myself, we are big fans of egg hoppers. The action station was queued with a lot of people willing to get hoppers. I think they should put two or more chefs to do that.

After all these things, the main part of the buffet is food, right? I thought we would forget all these shocking disappointments after eating good soothing food with some mouth-watering seafood. But I don’t know the reason, shockingly, we were so unfortunate because the food was extremely disappointing. Steamed rice and biriyani were the only rice options. Not even fried rice was there. Is Kingsbury an Indian hotel like Taj Samudra??? Because 60% of the food was Indian food! The beef was very chewy and not even slightly tender, resulting in me giving back my plate with that low quality beef. My friends strongly recommended that Kingsbury dinner buffet has more seafood varieties than other hotels, but being a seafood lover, I could barely find any seafood. I was wondering where this so-called legacy of Kingsbury has gone. So disappointing! The only seafood was some butter-fried pieces. Thinking something is better than nothing, I ate them. Again, as usual, it was disappointing. They had a very thin small fillet of fish under a big butter-fried layer. 
To be more specific, there was only chewy low-quality cuttlefish and fish with big layers of butter and oil. I mean, what is this guys? How can you make people feel mislead and take huge amounts of money for these low-quality food collections while claiming a very high standard five-star hotel? Then we came to the dessert section. Being a big ice-cream lover, I straightly went to the ice-cream kottu action station. To my huge disappointment, the guy in the dessert section said very rudely, ""There's no ice cream kottu, and we can't provide it since the board of the ice cream kottu maker is broken and not freezing to be eligible to make ice cream kottu."" Guys, this reflects a lack of attention to basic hospitality standards.  Can’t you guys try to repair it as soon as possible and provide the specific dessert again? Instead of being rude to guests. Then I tried to get normal ice cream, but the same rude guy serving ice cream was pouring scoops as little as laddus. Only two little scoops. It was disappointing to see such limited portions being served, especially for a high end buffet. Then the small chocolate pieces were finished, and only dark chocolate and mint chocolate was left, and they were not restocking for people. It’s very sad to see two tables away from us getting a birthday singing with a small cake but not us.

So, thank you very much Kingsbury for showing your true colors!! I am not coming to Kingsbury again and will not recommend it to others. These positive reviews about this Kingsbury are also very false because after paying the bill this manager guy came and asked from the four of us to write a good review with 5 stars mentioning his name. I felt very sad about these guys begging for good reviews on this platform. Finally, to whoever reading this, I wanna say I strongly advise others to reconsider before visiting Kingsbury!","A Huge Dissapointment about this Kingsbury","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d3801214-r1013056155-The_Kingsbury_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"266","805110266","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/fd/01/fa/samson-de-s.jpg","266","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samsondes","Samson De Silva","EF9D761011797F3841C84717ED7BBC41",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","samsondes"

La vue des chambres et du restaurant est panoramique et magnifique sur tout les alentours du lac et sur le temple de la dent….
La piscine, même petite, est un joyau triangulaire à débordement, l effet de la vue quand on se baigne est spectaculaire et saisissant.
Les chambres sont spacieuses, modernes et bien agencées, avec grand balcon et immense baie vitrée coulissante, elles sont toutes avec vue. Literie parfaite, transat et fauteuils confortables sur le balcon, clim silencieuse, douche spectaculaire (à découvrir) , luminaires, décoration , rien n est laissé au hasard !
Seul manque un meuble pour poser la valise…
Il y a l’espace, mais pas le meuble.
La réception a l air libre ou presque est bien intégrée, le personnel partout souriant et accueillant.
Le restaurant est dans la même lignée, le buffet du petit déjeuner et du dîner est parfait , les cuisiniers et les chefs toujours aux aguets pour vous mitonner un plat supplémentaire avec le sourire. Seule la musique d ambiance mériterait une plus grande diversité et surtout plus actuelle !
Je ne regrette vraiment pas mon choix et je conseille à tous de séjourner ici, loin du tumulte et de la pollution du centre-ville accessible en tuk tuk (10minutes / 500 Rp, soit 1,50€).","Séjour parfait dans un hôtel splendide !","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r996543940-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1061","559899437","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/21/5f/63/2d/jeanchristophe211.jpg","1061","25","274","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanchristophe211","Jean-Christophe","6F5A369200096BB0D2A3E42EABB2C643",,"196606","Lattes, France","Lattes","jeanchristophe211"

On arrival you need to pay in full before going to your room so be prepared if you use Revolut or similar. As is often the way here, you get told nothing at check in and need to work out everything for yourself. Once we were processed and in our room we had half a roll of toilet paper and just 2 hangers for our clothes, which seemed a bit miserly. We ate 2 nights at the hotel. The first night we tried to order a cocktail in the restaurant bar but despite the cocktail menus, no-one there could make them so we went up to the rooftop bar and discovered they also do food up there. I ordered a pork curry which I couldn't eat as the meat was fatty and chewy. My wife ordered the crab curry and was amazed to find that, rather than being served with fresh roti or some other local accompaniment, it came with 4 slices of toast (cheap sliced bread). The following night a lot of places were closed due to the national independence day so we ate again at the hotel and there was a special buffet. It was not bad but when I tried some of the beef curry I had the same issue as the previous night and couldn't eat it. On the positive side, the views are amazing, but many of the staff are quite young and lacking in skills. Basic questions are hard to get answers to, eg ""is the breakfast a buffet?"". I believe there are probably better places to stay in Kandy, which is a very picturesque city with green hills around a pretty lake, but after 3 nights here we were happy to be moving on.","A little disappointing","2025-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d25367549-r992506911-Grand_Serendib_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"205","19820693","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/95/avatar021.jpg","205","21","66","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrPiggyMalone","MrPiggyMalone","947A90AAFD548823175E05C6FBD489BC",,"186424","Worcester, United Kingdom","Worcester","MrPiggyMalone"

Firstly, I had read a few reviews ahead of time, and it got good reviews, but I also made sure to check online for the menu.  It had several pictures of an extensive menu displayed (roughly 3-4 pages worth including burgers, pizza, etc.) yet when I sat down and asked the waiter for the menu he passed me a tablet with a single page (only 5 or 6 items on the menu).  I tried scrolling thinking there were more, but it would not scroll!  So I decided on the wok rice with chicken and pineapple juice.  The food preparation took a normal amount of time, and the pineapple juice was good, however, the wok rice with chicken was absolutely horrible.  There was next to no taste, and the only spice was the black pepper added to the chicken.  After spending 2 weeks in Sri Lanka and having some amazing food, this was by far the worst meal I had.  But it does not end there... after finishing I moved my plate to the opposite side of the table and waited.  It took about 15 to 20 minutes before the waiter finally realized I was done (and only because his coworker noticed and sent him over).  When it came time to pay (I had checked before eating that card was OK, which I was told it was) the waiter brought my bill over, did not show it, and took my card which he disappeared upstairs for 3-4 minutes and came back with my receipt.  At no point during my meal did the waiter come by and ask how the meal was, or if I wanted anything else.  This place was absolutely disappointing, and I was very upset with the lack of service and quality of the food.  Something else I noticed, I had been eating all across Sri Lanka for the last 2 weeks (including Colombo) and the only charges on my bill were service charge (mostly 10% of the bill), however, this place I noticed added a 'goverment tax' of almost a third of the bill which I had not seen on any other receipt I received over my entire stay in Sri Lanka.  I would not recommend this place.","Food and service was horrible, not to mention ridiculous prices  (along with an unknown charge)","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d13160059-r992103428-ME_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"412","51827286","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/16/d2/56/jim-b.jpg","550","17","43","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845JimB","Jim B","0FDFBFFBC2E485FB0A34416D008BA602",,"155019","Toronto, Canada","Toronto","845JimB"

We had an excellent stay at RADH Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming, professional, and attentive to every detail. The hotel itself is beautifully maintained, offering a perfect blend of comfort and elegance. Our room was spotless, well-appointed, and provided a truly relaxing experience.

However, during our stay, we were deeply ashamed to witness the way some tourists mistreated the hardworking staff. We saw an incident where a guest, after breaking several plates, refused to take responsibility and instead threatened to leave a negative review on TripAdvisor to avoid paying. The staff, despite being in an unfair and helpless situation, handled it with patience and professionalism.

As guests who appreciate good service and ethical behavior, we want to extend our apologies to the staff on behalf of responsible travelers. No one should have to endure such intimidation simply for doing their job. Hospitality workers deserve respect, and it is disheartening to see some guests exploit platforms like TripAdvisor to manipulate situations in their favor.

We highly recommend RADH Hotel and commend the staff for their dedication. Thank you for making our stay memorable—we will certainly return.","Great stay great staff","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d15149838-r992694749-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d0maniea","Caroline B","0BF1FC09621591D585057F3659FE559C",,"255055","Australia","Australia","d0maniea"

 disappointment. Wifi instructions seriously lacking clarity - an annoying start after a long day travelling. Telephone had numbers worn off on the keypad so calling for assistance very hard. Mini fridge door dropped and did not shut properly.  Shower had black mould at the base and in the silicone.  Mirrored pillar on balcony badly cracked. Carpet on landing area stained and scruffy. No hand towel in bathroom and my request for one failed. Noise from construction all day. Why build a roof top pool when simple things are not up to standard? Noise from kitchen area below at 6am.

Thank you for dining with us and for sharing your feedback. We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed the food and found the coffee perfect.

Regarding the government tax, we understand that it may have come as a surprise. As per Sri Lankan regulations, taxes are applicable to all restaurant bills, and we ensure transparency by listing them on our menu. However, we appreciate your suggestion and will review how we present pricing to make it clearer for our guests.

We also regret that some of the mocktails were unavailable during your visit. We strive to maintain a full selection, and we will work on improving this aspect of our service.

We appreciate your insights and hope to welcome you again for an even better dining experience.

Our experience at The Radh Hotel was truly delightful. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warm hospitality and attentive service. The hotel’s location is ideal—just a short walk from the iconic Temple of the Tooth and the peaceful Kandy Lake, making it a great starting point for exploring the city.

The rooms were beautifully designed, very clean, and equipped with all the modern comforts. We stayed in a room with a private terrace, which added a special touch to our visit. Relaxing outside in the calm surroundings was a highlight.

The on-site restaurant was excellent. The food was fresh, flavorful, and offered a lovely mix of local and international dishes. Breakfast, in particular, stood out with its wide range of delicious options.

One thing to note: there was some noise from construction work right next to our room. Thankfully, the staff responded quickly and stopped the noise when we mentioned it. However, it might be a good idea to check the status of construction if you’re planning to stay soon.

The staff were incredibly kind and professional, always going the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed.

Pros:
The colonial-style architecture and decor create a unique and appealing atmosphere.
The hotel is clean and well-maintained.
Its central location makes it ideal for exploring Kandy’s key attractions.

Cons:
Despite being heavily advertised, the house-specialty pizza was disappointing and didn’t meet expectations.
The price for the breakfast buffet was far too high considering the offerings, which didn’t justify the cost.

Overall, the hotel is a good choice for those who appreciate a colonial-style setting and a central location, but the dining experience could use some improvement.","Charming Colonial-Style Hotel in the Heart of Kandy","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d15149838-r982801452-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680nilsw","Nils W","ACC5A8417EDBD129B5F3B8B6A55FF1C0",,,,,"680nilsw"

The Accommodation is beautiful with stunning views of the fort. The staff are amazing and are truly attentive to all your needs. They go out of there way to say hello and guide you through the cuisine and hotel amenities. We had our own private pool which was luxurious. The only downside is the access road to the hotel (no fault of the actual resort owners). For my mind a hotel that is bringing in tourist dollars should be looked after however it is hard for any car to enter and exit. Additionally because of this you are stuck having to use the tuk tuks outside the hotel (again not associated with the hotel and scare away any other driver) rather then use pickme or uber. The local authorities should really look into making it a more hospitable environment outside the hotel and keep the tourists coming.","Only place to stay in Galle","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r1010542006-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390984","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg","1200","34","363","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381kyliec","Kylie C","C7EC70392B90884944EC9378440FB602",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","381kyliec"

We arrived to a warm, welcoming smile by Prasanna the baggage handler, and instantly felt at home! 
The check-in staff were also attentive, and provided us with maximum assurance and hospitability by kindly arranging an upgraded, Signature room! 

The welcome drinks also had plentiful cool and warm drinks to choose from and we were able to enjoy them in front of the truly beautiful view captured from the lobby floor. 

The signature room was the perfect room that overlooked the Galle fort, beach and the hotel garden and pool as well as clean facilities. 

The rest of the stay was spent on enjoying the set-menu meals, where all options were perfectly curated to the local and foreign preferences. Each meal from lunch to dinner to breakfast was able to be enjoyed because of the peaceful restaurant service provided by the restaurant staff such as Nihal Ranasinghe!

For those who enjoy exploring, the hotel garden had a convenient access stairway to the beach, a mini library, spa and a great outdoor view that wrapped around the beach coast letting you truly enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of Galle!

Overall, the staff, services and facilities provided by Le Grand Galle show that this hotel is definitely a must to return as it is family-friendly, traveller-friendly, and beautifully scenic!

The employees are so kind and caring. The pool and other facilities are perfect and dinner is subtle but substantial (well done to the Chef).

The music at the reception and bar is really nice and calming down resulting in a relaxed atmosphere. 

The staff is really kind and smiling. 
The shower in the bathroom has two types rainwaterfall function and normal. 
Buffet is diverse, with Sri Lankan and other styles.

Bad:
We paid for the superior room with Kingsize bed, and came late in the evening. Next morning, we wanted to change the room to a twin room. It was in a lot of aspects a downgrade. 

 We got multiples power outages like 4-5 times in the evening from 19.30h when we got back from our trip (having to shower in the dark). Also, a trail of ants was marking the roof above our heads in the bathroom. Most of the power outlets in the room were not working. We had to unplug other devices to use working power outlets. Another issue, there was no locker in the new room. 

We didn’t experience these things in our previous room. 

More general issue, the Wifi connection is really poor, still able to send text messages, but visiting websites takes such a long time.","Poor Wifi, power outages, nonfunctional outlets, ants; but calm, relaxing resort","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d447407-r1013084486-Sigiriya_Village_Hotel-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887wilbertv","Wilbert","A150BB4833020BC0FE59071B14CB6438",,,,,"887wilbertv"

We've tried most hotels in the area. And this was our second visit to this property. 

Highlights of the property - it's a very large and beautiful property designed by the famous architect Gefforey Bawa. There are also some lovely pieces of art forming part of the interior design. It is a also situated in a unique location with the sea on one side and the Bentara river on the other side. 

There are two wings. We've stayed in both. One wing is a little far away from the restaurants, reception, gym, kids play area etc. We booked a terrace room and were later upgraded to a luxury sea front room. But we could barely see the sea from our room in the first floor (didn't mind though since this was a free upgrade). This is because there is actually a small lane and a tree cover between the property and the public beach. The second floor probably gives better views. But the room was lovely! It was very spacious with a large balcony as well and had all the luxuries. 

They have a sizeable pool. The beach is public (You have to a cross a small lane to get to the beach) but clean. And the hotel does provide some beach chairs and umbrellas. 

They have a fabulous breakfast with a massive spread!!!! (It was actually the highlight of the visit 😉) For lunch, we went a la carte at their sea food restaurant. If I recall correctly, the extensive sea food menu was aviable only for dinner but they had their normal menu and what we got was quite exceptional. 

The dinner was not as fabulous as breakfast (especially the salads and desserts) but still quite good. One pet peeve was that the main restaurant had only a small area which was air conditioned. The rest of the area didn't even have fans. It was extremely humid the day we visited and coupled with the heat from all the cooking, we were sweating buckets, so much so that we kept an alarm on our second day and came very early for breakfast to get a spot in the air-conditioned section. 😀

Both breakfast and dinner had an extensive spread of local, Indian, East Asian and Western dishes. The staff weren't particularly friendly but were quite efficient except for a minor hassel related to our booking.

All in all, highly recommended if you are just looking to laze around (i.e. eat, sleep, swim) in comfort. [P.s they do offer painting classes, yoga, third party managed excursions in the river if you are looking for more energetic options.]","Ideal getaway","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r1009267396-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Pro.html",,"1311","805114383","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/fd/12/0f/caption.jpg","1311","4","787","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltales2023","Traveltales","1E44B8C9F669FACC1240252DB23EBE06",,"13968411","Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka","Rajagiriya","traveltales2023"

Serenath and his team go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay.

The rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and well appointed.

The large bath with a view out to the ocean is amazing!

The housekeeping team make sure your room is immaculate.

The reception staff very welcoming, friendly and helpful.

The waiting and kitchen staff are very efficient, friendly and make sure that your food is just right for you and are happy to deal with any special requests.

The food was exceptional and the fruit juices were worth the wait for them to be prepared from ripe fresh fruit. The Thambili and passion fruit juices are highly recommended.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're sincerely sorry that your experience during the Kandy Perahera did not meet your expectations, especially as it was a significant occasion like your honeymoon and your wife’s birthday.

We would like to address the concerns you've raised:

1. **Ants in the Room**: We apologize for the ants you encountered. However, upon a thorough inspection, we noted a small number of ants, which we promptly addressed. Our housekeeping team is diligent in maintaining cleanliness, and we regret that this issue affected your stay.

2. **Early Arrival and Room Readiness**: We recommended early arrival to help you avoid the road closures and other inconveniences associated with the Perahera. You arrived at 11:00 AM, and while there was a brief wait, your room was ready as soon as you finished at the restaurant. We strive to accommodate early arrivals and regret any delay you may have experienced.

3. **Entry and Exit Restrictions**: The Kandy Perahera is one of Sri Lanka’s most sacred and celebrated religious events. The festival, which honors the Sacred Tooth Relic, brings together millions of devotees and visitors. As such, road closures and restricted access are part of the regulations to ensure the sanctity and smooth conduct of the event. While these restrictions are beyond our control, we appreciate your understanding of their importance. Being in Kandy during the Perahera is truly a rare privilege, and we hope that amidst the challenges, you were able to appreciate the unique cultural significance of the event.

4. **Construction Noise**: The noise you experienced was due to Perahera-related activities on the streets, not hotel renovations. The festival brings a vibrant but sometimes noisy atmosphere to the entire city, which we try to mitigate for our guests as much as possible.

5. **Local Conditions During Perahera**: The closure of certain attractions and the restrictions on alcohol service are part of the cultural observance of the Perahera. These traditions are deeply rooted in the local culture and are integral to the festival's authenticity. We understand that this may have impacted your experience, but we hope you can appreciate the importance of these customs during such a special time.

6. **Customer Service**: We are disappointed to hear that our service did not meet your expectations. When you checked out, you mentioned that you had a nice room and seemed satisfied with your stay. Our records show no formal complaint was made during your stay or at checkout, which is why we were unable to address your concerns in real-time. We strive to provide excellent service, and your feedback will be used to improve our communication and service delivery in the future.

We regret that your experience during this culturally significant time was not as enjoyable as we hoped it would be. We understand your concerns and would like to offer you a special discount on your next stay as a gesture of goodwill.

Thank you again for your feedback. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back under more favorable circumstances.

Warm regards,

The Radh Hotel, Kandy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30 Colombo Street, Kandy 20000 Sri Lanka","Kandy","Sri Lanka","20000",,"30 Colombo Street",,"15149838","7.29415","Kandy, Kandy District, Central Province","80.63873","The Radh","342","4.5","6","7","19","74","236","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304138-d15149838-Reviews-The_Radh-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html","http://www.theradh.com","2024-08-18","OTHER","1","Do not visit during the Kandy Perahera.

Do not visit during the Kandy Perahera! We had Ants in our room and we were trapped outside of the hotel for 6 hours until 11:30pm. There was also constant loud construction noise all day. 

We were told to arrive early to avoid any 'inconveniences' due to road closures. We arrived early and our room was not ready. Once we got to the room we found ants and the wrong baggage was taken to our room. 

What was most frustrating is we were never told that we would be unable to exit or enter the hotel after the festival started. To make matters worse it was incredibly crouded, it was hard to get tuk tuks or taxis, local attractions were shut, lots of restaurants were shut with the ones open not serving alcohol. So for 6 hours there was little for us to do.

When we raised our complaint with the Radh after, their customer service was shocking. They argued that there were 5 ants as if it was acceptable and that they messaged us to say 'arrive before 2pm to avoid inconveniences due to road closures'. This was not a warning about entry or exit after the festival started.

Overall, it caused undue stress and upset on our honeymoon & my Wife's birthday.","Poor.

Great hot shower and they use Spa Ceylon which was nice.

Handed 2 pcs of shirt to the hotel for washing and it was returned within hours which was fantastic and it was only 250LKR per pc.

Breakfast was a semi-buffet style there's fruit, cheese and cereal available, and you can order on top rice and curry, or western breakfast. The portion was huge.

My mother and I had an amazing stay at Mandarina Colombo, and we couldn’t be happier with the service we received. From the moment we arrived late at night, Pubudu and Rehan made check-in seamless and welcoming, ensuring we were comfortable after a long journey. Similarly, during our late-night checkout, they made the process just as smooth.  

A special thank you to Leon, who went above and beyond to help us plan our 3-day itinerary. His insights and recommendations truly made our trip memorable, and we appreciated his patience and local knowledge.  

The hotel itself was fantastic—clean, comfortable, and in a great location. The staff’s warmth and professionalism made all the difference, and we highly recommend Mandarina Colombo to anyone visiting Sri Lanka. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!","**Exceptional Service and Comfortable Stay at Mandarina Colombo","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12002902-r997454222-Mandarina_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cruiser64051878293","Cruiser64051878293","8069984092CB336D938736C492782145",,,,,"Cruiser64051878293"

Firstly the stay was great. Checkin wonderful, the room was really spacious and clean, with fantastic views over Kandy from the balcony. 
The infinity pool was fabulous but too cold for swimming in the day we visited. 

The restaurant however was not up to try same standard. One of the meals we ordered was a burger which arrived cold. We complained and it came back seconds later, but clearly the whole plate had been microwaved as the coleslaw was now also warm. The restaurant needs to be brought up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel.","Hotel great.

I highly recommend the hotel for foreign tourists who fancy the exotic coastal landscape of Sri Lanka.","My fascinating stay in the coasts of Benthota","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r1015643488-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390771","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321chathurangaw","chathuranga w","E34CB44CB1D4566752C6335AC73C6722",,,,,"321chathurangaw"

Whatever you do. Don’t book it!!! Pay a little extra and go somewhere else. 

Staff were terrible re service and level and quality of service. I would ask for ice and would wait 30-40 mins before having to follow up on where the ice was. When I’d ask sometimes they’d say they didn’t have any. Which is ridiculous for the size of the hotel. 

Left my room at 7am ,left sign for fresh bedding/ room tidy. Got back at 2.30pm nothing done. Then called and said someone there in 5 mins. 20mins later called back again. Another 20 mins still nothing had to go ask someone down the corridor to help. 

Food terrible and tasteless. Hotel rooms dated and OLDDDDD and not very clean at all!! In addition be prepared to not have a plug socket anywhere near the bed. 

Only good thing was checkout and the beach.","DO NOT BOOK HERE","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d315672-r1015414730-Ekho_Surf-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387402","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4182ZHchristyb","Christy B","4F00A3CE87DDAD22188049DF8BF11DEA",,,,,"U4182ZHchristyb"

From the moment we arrived, he was incredibly kind, friendly, and genuinely attentive to every little detail.

Pasindu has that rare mix of professionalism and warmth — always nearby when we needed something, but never intrusive. He remembered our preferences, made thoughtful suggestions, and had such a calm, positive energy that made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

It’s rare to come across someone who takes such pride in what they do. You can feel it in how he speaks, how he serves, and how he treats guests — with real respect and care.

We arrived in the evening, and the two staff members at the front desk gave us a warm welcome. We were offered a welcome drink, cold towels, and a refreshing welcome gesture with three different types of treats. They handled everything quickly and efficiently.

Kasun assisted us with showing the room and completing the payment process. He also gave us detailed information about the hotel. From the moment we arrived, he was extremely helpful and kind. We truly appreciated the service we received from Kasun.

Not recommend to use. ","Value","1","Rooms","1","Location","4","Cleanliness","1","Service","1","Sleep Quality","1","We stayed at Le - Grand Hotel, Galle from May 11th to May 12th, 2025, on a Full Board, (Double) basis, and unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected from a 5-star hotel.

🔹 Location & View:
The only highlight of our stay was the stunning view of the Galle Fort. The hotel’s location is excellent close to the Galle fort with beautiful scenery.

🔹 Room Issues:
The room allocated to us was not in good condition. The main door lock was faulty, and although a technician was sent to fix it after i made a request to rectify, it took about 45 minutes, disturbing our privacy and taking away from our short one day stay.
Additionally, the balcony door wouldn’t close properly and remained unfixed during our stay creating a serious security and comfort concern.

🔹 In-room Amenities:
Despite our booking being for 2 people on FB basis, the room was only arranged and stocked for one person, only one bottle of water, single sets of tea/coffee, shampoo, body wash and etc. I had to repeatedly call, request and remind staff to provide necessities what we required for 2 people.

To make matters worse, one of the towels provided was damaged, which was shocking and unacceptable from a hotel claiming to be 5-star. (Photo attached)

🔹 Dining Experience:
The dinner buffet had very limited variety and the food quality was poor. The breakfast buffet was even worse. Certain items like sausages and eggs were hidden and not freely offered unless specifically requested. We asked for two cheese omelets, but after waiting for nearly 30 minutes, we received only one, and it didn’t even have cheese.

🔹 Checkout Experience:
Our checkout was scheduled at 12 PM, but since lunch was only served from 1:30 PM, we requested a late checkout, which was denied. We were left waiting outside until lunch started.
Adding insult to injury, instead of a buffet lunch (which was part of the FB plan), we were given an à la carte menu, as the hotel claimed low occupancy. During this time, staff behavior was unwelcoming. they looked at us as if we were loitering, which made us feel very uncomfortable and disrespected.

🔹 Overall Summary:

- Poor room condition and maintenance
- Insufficient in room amenities for a double occupancy
- Damaged towel provided. This is totally unacceptable and disappointed (Photo attached)
- Low quality food and lack of verities in buffet offerings
- Poor service and unacceptable attitude by some staff when we were waiting for the lunch despite FB booking
- No flexibility with check-out (Even we booked FB basis)

Our stay at Le Grand Hotel, Galle was extremely disappointing and not worth the premium pricing and the 5-star rating. We would not recommend this hotel, especially if you’re expecting comfort, proper service, or value for money.","Extremely Disappointing Stay at Le - Grand Hotel, Galle, Sri Lanka– Not Worth the 5-Star Rating","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d14033359-r1007794454-Le_Grand_Galle-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833chamikak","Chamika K","3052C4FCEA2289FB37281488B3B1959A",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","833chamikak"

The location is truly special, one side of the hotel offers a stunning lake view, and you can walk all the way through the property to reach the beautiful beach on the other side. The pools are lovely, and the pool bar is cool. The team there is friendly, attentive, and they even remembered our previous orders, which made us feel genuinely welcomed.
The buffet for both breakfast and dinner were excellent, offering a wide variety of tasty dishes with something for everyone. The setting, overlooking the lake, made the dining experience even more enjoyable. The selection covers most cuisines, so there's always something new and delicious to try.
Overall, this hotel stands out for its thoughtful service, beautiful setting, and exceptional amenities. We would gladly return and highly recommend it!","Outstanding!","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d15292088-r1006377068-Cinnamon_Bentota_Beach_Signature_Selection-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Pro.html",,"450","442933127","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/66/9f/87/avatar.jpg","450","12","245","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mirnakh99","Mirna Khalil","7571282B5434041A8C05E9B7F9ACBB81",,"294008","Qatar","Qatar","mirnakh99"

The beachfront location is stunning, offering breathtaking views and a truly relaxing atmosphere. The staff were exceptionally warm and attentive, always ready to assist with a smile. From check-in to check-out, the service was seamless and professional.

The room was clean, well-maintained, and comfortably furnished, with everything I needed for a pleasant stay. I especially appreciated the attention to detail and the effort to create a welcoming environment. The food was another highlight—delicious, fresh, and with a good variety to suit all tastes.

That said, a few areas could use some improvement. The Wi-Fi connection was a bit inconsistent at times, and a few more vegetarian options on the menu would be appreciated. Also, the poolside could benefit from a few more shaded lounging areas.

Overall, EKHO Surf exceeded my expectations. It’s an ideal place for both relaxation and adventure, and I would gladly return. Thank you for making my stay memorable and enjoyable.

Dinner by Chef Thiran Fernando was a standout — he customized the meal to our taste and it turned out to be one of the best meals of our entire trip.

Another unique experience was the Ayurvedic consultation with their in-house doctor before our wellness session. It added a deeply personal and thoughtful touch, and made the whole experience feel truly holistic and rejuvenating.

The property is spacious, quiet and serene and the lawn by the lagoon is a great space to chill. The rooms are exceptionally large and very comfortable (we were in a luxury room in the ground floor overlooking the lagoon). The menu incorporates both healthy and regular options and all the dishes we tried were delicious and beautifully presented. It was especially  nice to see a lot of imaginative fusion dishes incorporating local ingredients (especially recommend the Negombo Coconut Cake and the woodapple smoothie). But the most impressive thing about the hotel (as always) was the outstanding staff. The service is really top-notch. My parents are elderly and therefore have some mobility challenges and specific dietary needs. The restaurant team (Aruna, Imashi, Ranmini, Nadeesha and Pasindu) went the extra mile to make sure that all their needs were fulfilled and that they had an enjoyable stay. Their genuine kindness and attentiveness made my parents feel truly welcomed and at ease. A warm thank-you also to the amiable Ravindu from Housekeeping for his warm and efficient service and for taking such good care of us all! His thoughtful care left a lasting impression on our stay and is much appreciated. The spa is well-appointed and our therapists Nuwan, Mahel and Insam were clearly skilled and well-trained. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Thank you Jetwing Lagoon for another wonderful stay!

Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb, dafür idyllisch an der Lagune und eine Straßenüberquerung vom Strand entfernt. In der unmittelbaren Umgebung war jedoch nichts. Das Hotel ist schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber sehr gut gepflegt. Mit seiner Farbgebung und seinem Stil wirkte es auf uns eher wie eine Reha- Klinik. Die Zimmer waren sehr groß, sauber und wirkten in ihrem Stil eher nüchtern. Vom Abendessen waren wir enttäuscht. Wir hatten uns für Kotelett entschieden. Dieses war sehr klein und mit hohem Fettanteil. Dazu gab es eine kleine Kartoffel. Es entsprach eher einer Vorspeise als einem Hauptgang. Das Frühstück bot eine große Auswahl vorwiegend auf asiatische Gäste abgestimmt. Eierspeisen und z B. Hoppers wurden frisch auf Wunsch zubereitet. Wir buchten uns noch zwei Massagen und bekamen eine der übliche ""Streichel- Wohlfühlmassagen"" im guten Preisverhältnis. Das Personal war stets sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Für unseren Kurzaufenthalt ein entspannter Urlaubsausklang. Für einen längeren Aufenthalt würden wir hier jedoch nicht buchen.

The atmosphere, enhanced by live music and colonial charm, made our stay especially memorable.

The service throughout the hotel was warm and friendly, including from General Manager Suresh Abbas, who was often visible and engaging with guests.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. Although we had booked three rooms, the front office declined our request for a late checkout on just one room unless we paid half the room rate, which felt a bit inflexible. Some parts of the hotel are showing signs of age—for example, the carpet along the corridor is quite worn and would be better removed if it can’t be replaced.

We also had a safety concern with the shower setup over the bathtub, as there was no anti-slip mat provided. Fortunately, the hotel responded promptly and moved us to another room the next day upon request.","Hotel with a colonial charm","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r1015644121-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"720","409394475","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/66/dd/2b/balasubra.jpg","720","62","100","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balasubra","balasubra","79A48443114ADA1D3ACF44841CCDA105",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","balasubra"

During that time, I’ve stayed in private villas, hostels and family homes. For my final two nights in the capital city, I wanted some luxury with a colonial touch. An iconic landmark that would hold a lasting memory. 

For over 160 years, Galle Face Hotel has blended colonial charm with modern elegance, earning its place as the Grande Dame of South Asia and the most iconic destination in Colombo. Celebrates such as Steven Spielberg, Che Guevara, Earnest Hemingway, Sting, Sade, Robbie Williams, Lord Mountbatten and Richard Nixon have stayed here. 

The buffet is fantastic and I’m not a fan of these at all. Service is impeccable and staff go above and beyond to ensure you have a memorable stay whilst here. They’re proud to work here. The pool is unfortunately salt water and not chlorinated. The views are spectacular and for once I never left the hotel. This very unusual for me. 

The passionfruit frozen daiquiri is to die for as is the cheesecake. The mutton Rogan Josh was delicious, the sweet selection, gin & tonics and of course the Lion draught beer. This was impulsively booked right at the last minute. My room was fit for a prince, overlooking the Indian Ocean and Galle Face Green. Spectacular and what an outstanding front of house team. A touch of class, sophistication and elegance.","A Touch Of Class.","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d2038179-r1015072073-Galle_Face_Hotel-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"2048","687801733","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/ff/05/85/caption.jpg","2048","121","767","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinmarley","Justin Marley","26E5121774960DFEE9176B38A98B07E1",,"186460","Cardiff, United Kingdom","Cardiff","justinmarley"

While the resort has its flaws, one standout was the exceptional service provided by Imasha at the beach club department.

A hotel with a great view (may not be applicable for all rooms) and location. We are happy with everything except few observations and suggestions - we needed triple occupancy. Because of the extra bed the room became congested with our luggages. So for triple occupancy a bigger room should have been allocated. The shower area is almost half of the room whereas there is separate toilet and hand-wash area. The infinity pool is just awesome. However, the size especially the width is so narrow that it's rather an area to see the view than swim. Generally out of their 4 lifts 2 remain operational at any time. As there lobby is in 1st floor and there is no stairs except probably fire exit, the wait time is quiet high in rush hours.

The room key kept on deactivating and every time had to go down to the reception. one thing the hotel can improve is the waiting time for the lifts.  it takes ages to get a lift. Even with 4 lifts but with 27 floors, it's busy during peak hours.

I spent one day there. The rooms were very tidy and clean, and the food was delicious.

I’d like to thank the reception team for providing me with an early check-in. Their service is highly recommended.

With conversation with the manager, I noticed that some could be identified as misunderstanding or miscommunication however overall, I don't think this quality of service is acceptable in 4 star hotel. I am now regretting that I spoke with him because he was not trying to do something to make me feel better, rather I felt as if he blamed me and treated me like a silly customer who is trying to take an advantage of the situation. This made me feel very miserable. He walked away at 8:50 am stating that ""I have a meeting at 9"" and did not show the willingness to speak any further.

As a Japanese, I felt really disappointed that such poor quality of service is provided by the Japanese corporate. I admit that the facility, location, some of the staff members are great here. Especially Aidan at reception was over and beyond - when I addressed the same issue, he genuinely treated me with compassion and empathy and validated my feelings, saying ""Is there anything I can do ma'am"". Aidan worked really hard so that we can extend our stay in the same room as both me and my husband became sick and wished to do so. 
Housekeeping supervisor Suraj who cleaned our room in the fifth date of our stay was also kind, attentive and extremely accommodating. We appreciate him for bringing extra water bottles from downstairs for us as we were recovering from our sickness. I felt that Suraj was the one who finally provided us with a right level of cleaning service.

I can see some of the negative reviews which I sometimes doubt about but now I can truly understand how people who wrote these felt. They are mostly about staff's attitude and the quality of cleaning that as the leading the cause of disappointment. These are all about management and process issues, not staff members.","Disappointed about the management here","2025-06","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23958991-r1011016673-Granbell_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail656614","沙織 松","43E7D8B854FEAFC4AEBA796D2FACAE01",,,,,"Trail656614"

My family and I stayed at the Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya on Friday, May 9th, 2025, for two nights. We have been visiting this hotel for more than 30 years. It’s a very special place to us, and we’ve always had beautiful memories here since we were children.

The hotel looks lovely now .It’s been beautifully refurbished. The garden is still stunning, and the whole place feels very warm and homely. We always choose the Grand Hotel when we visit Nuwara Eliya.

This time, most of the staff were friendly and welcoming, especially at the entrance. But sadly, our experience was affected by the front office. The lady who handled our booking was not very friendly, but we didn’t pay much attention at first. However, our biggest disappointment was with the front office manager a lady whose name starts with ""K.""

She was extremely rude, unfriendly, and arrogant from the start. Her attitude was cold, her body language was dismissive, and she spoke to us as if we were in a police station. She was not flexible, didn’t smile, and treated us in a very unpleasant way. We didn’t feel like guests – we felt like we were being questioned or told off. It was honestly shocking.

We kindly ask the management to please speak to her. Guests come to the hotel paying for a relaxing and enjoyable stay  not for free and definitely not to be treated with such a bad attitude. Her behaviour completely ruined the warm and homely feeling we’ve always loved at this hotel. We have travelled many times, even abroad, but we have never experienced such rude treatment from a front office manager anywhere else.

The rest of the staff were lovely. They were kind, professional, and respectful exactly what we expect from a hotel like this. They helped make the rest of our stay more pleasant.

Special thanks to the team at the Thai restaurant — the food was fantastic, and the staff, especially Chrithana and Anthony, were excellent. They were friendly, caring, and made us feel very comfortable. Honestly, the Thai food was better than anything we’ve had in Colombo! The breakfast was also great , fresh, tasty, and well presented.

We truly love the Grand Hotel and have so many memories here. Please don’t let one staff member take that away from loyal guests like us. We hope to return again, but we do hope the front office service improves.","We Love This Hotel – But Very Disappointed by the Front Office Manager","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579206-r1013824896-The_Grand_Hotel_Nuwara_Eliya_Heritage_Grand-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391608","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","1200","8","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462ishadia","Ishadi A","B9AE74C80DB521CEC32DE196E75D13D7",,,,,"462ishadia"

We enjoyed dining at Grand Indian, Grand Thai, Magnolia, and Barns Hall buffet, all of which offered high-quality food at reasonable prices. The only minor downside was that tea was somewhat pricey, which is surprising for a tea-producing country.

It is certainly one of them. 

I have traveled extensively and was pleasantly surprised over and over again during my two stays at the Marino Beach Hotel.   Why?  Staffing and service; rooms and  guest amenities; and unexpected extras.   

Staffing and service: the staff at Marino Beach hotel is plentiful, responsive, welcoming, and well-trained.   They exude self-respect and respect for their guests.   There was always someone available when needed at the concierge desk, dining room, check-in, and for special requests.   In fact, the hotel has a ""hostess"" in the lobby who greets you immediately when you enter or come off the elevator and answers questions or directs you where needed.  The manager sits at a desk right in the lobby, so they always know what is going on on the floor and can help as needed.   The staff teams in each area seem to have a chain of command, but everyone also cheerfully pitches in and appear to enjoy each other's company.   How did they achieve this positive culture so consistently throughout the organization?   I don't know, but I think other organizations could learn a lot by studying them. 

Rooms and amenities:  Whoever designed the Marino Beach Hotel took the best features from every other 5-star hotel and put them all in one place.  My favorites: 1) There is great lighting in the bathroom and even a lighted make-up mirror!  The bathroom also features a separate tub and walk-in shower; a drying line; hooks for your towel; lots of toiletry supplies of all kinds; easily accessible towels; and clear walls so it feels spacious, but also has an electric shade if you want to wall off the bathroom from the bedroom.  The sinktop has room for all our stuff.  The water pressure is excellent and it's easy to adjust the water temperature.   The bathroom is perfect. 

2) There is balcony with a sea view from every room and two comfortable chairs, which is also a great place to dry your bathing suit. 

3) The bed is large and comfy, and each side of the bed can control its own reading light, a bedside light, and the room lights.  Wow!   

4) There is lots of storage in the room: a large closet with drawers and plenty of hangers; bedside tables with two spacious drawers in each; and other various nooks and drawers for your stuff.    There is also a lot of tabletop surface.   

5) The room is large, nicely appointed and spotlessly clean.  You can control the temperature.  It has sunblocking drapes as well as light white drapes.   The room has a refrigerator and a safe, both of which work easily.   There is a water boiler and a selection of tea and coffee with condiments.  The space feels great. 

6) The hotel itself has a stunning and large infinity pool on the roof, with different areas for seating -- at the edge of the pool, in the water; in sunbeds with curtains;  and sunbeds in the garden.   Even when there were a lot of people a the pool, you never felt crowded.   And there are three hottubs!  Enough for everyone!  The pool even has a smaller, separated area, which is where the families tended to hang out.  The smaller pool felt safer for kids, I think.  

Unexpected Extras:
This is where Marino Beach Hotel especially shines and delights guests.   

1) There is a FREE, 3-hour city tour that covers many of the major sights in Colombo, and gives you time to get off the bus and actually visit the sites.  The hotel pays for entrance fees.   Unfortunately, my husband and I did not do the hotel's city tour because, before we arrived in Colombo, we had scheduled other touristy things that filled our days.  But when we talked with guests who did the hotel's city tour we were very sad that we had toured with other organizations.  The Marino Beach Hotel tour sounded better than anything we had done. 

2) The Hotel owns a BEACH AREA with a restaurant, sunbeds, and a beautiful clean beach only 10 minutes away.  There are hourly shuttles to the beach area.   FANTASTIC. 

3) There are sodas and water in the refrigerator, and cookies and peanuts on the counter for guests to consume. . . free of charge. So sweet. 

4) The hotel restaurants are all top-of-the-line.  In fact, we ended our tour in-country a day early so we could come back to Marino Beach and enjoy the pool, the gym, and especially the fantastic restaurants.   On the 10th floor, there is an Ocean Grill and a Chinese/Thai restaurant; you can order from both menus.   The sea bass at the Ocean Grill with lemon butter sauce was TO DIE FOR.    All their entrees come with a choice of sauces.  My husband had a great hamburger.   The breakfast buffet has too many  options; we always ended up stuffing ourselves.   Be sure to reserve the breakfast buffet when you reserve your room -- it costs twice as much if you have to buy breakfast separately. 

Finally, I will tell you that the Marino Beach Hotel will be listed as a 4-star hotel in the websites like TripAdvisor.  It is a 5-star hotel or better, but the government of Sri Lanka requires a minimum room charge for 5-star hotels that is higher than what Marino Beach charges.   We felt like the Marino Beach Hotel was a fantastic value.   You just won't go wrong in any way at this place.  At least, that was our experience.","One of the best hotels in the world.

The hospitality was exceptional — the team was always friendly, attentive, and ready to assist, which made traveling with kids so much easier and stress-free. The hotel’s peaceful atmosphere and beautiful surroundings were perfect for a family getaway.

We also loved the food! The restaurant served a great variety of delicious western, indian and Sri Lankan dishes that everyone enjoyed, including options suitable for the little one. Every meal was fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.

All in all, Hotel Sigiriya offered us the perfect blend of comfort, excellent service, and tasty food. It truly made our family trip special.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

While we are pleased to hear that you found our staff to be friendly and that you enjoyed the buffet on your final night, we are truly sorry to learn that the overall condition of your stay did not meet your expectations — particularly as this was the last stop on what had otherwise been an amazing holiday in Sri Lanka.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the cleanliness and maintenance issues you encountered in your room. The inconsistencies you noted, including missing amenities and the presence of an old invoice, are unacceptable and fall far short of the standards we strive to uphold. Your feedback has been shared in detail with our housekeeping and operations teams for immediate review and corrective action.

We understand how important a clean and well-maintained environment is, and we deeply regret that we did not deliver on this during your stay. Your comments serve as an important reminder of the need for consistent attention to detail across all guest rooms.

Although we did not meet your expectations this time, we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again in the future and provide you with the high standards of comfort and care we are known for.

Unfortunately the posed pictures do not reflect what the rooms were like in reality. 
All our 3 rooms on the 2nd floor facing the ocean were dirty and had mould on the floor and robes in the cupboards. 
Also the rooms were not made in a consistent standard. 
Our room for example (317) had no robes, laundry bag, coffee for plunger and phone directory on the phone. Also there were no welcome biscuits in our room that the other 2 rooms had. 
An old invoice from the previous guest was also left on the mini bar fridge. 
The buffet food was excellent on the last night which was great. The staff also very friendly.

Right from check-in, the hospitality was outstanding. Kapil was really great in taking care of the hospitality. A special mention to Tharushi, who went above and beyond by offering me a complimentary upgrade to a suite. Her warmth, professionalism, and genuine care made an immediate impression and set the tone for my entire stay. Thank you, Tharushi & Kapil, for making me feel so welcome from day one!

The suite itself was spacious, stylish, and equipped with all modern amenities—ideal for a long-term guest like me. It had everything I needed to feel comfortable and productive, including fast Wi-Fi, smart lighting, and a cozy ambiance.

Location: Perfectly situated near the Dutch Hospital Precinct with easy access to restaurants, historical landmarks, and the city’s vibrant culture, while still offering peace and quiet inside the hotel.

Facilities and Service:

Impeccable housekeeping and cleanliness throughout the stay

Friendly, efficient staff always ready to assist

A rooftop bar with great views—perfect for relaxing evenings

In-house dining with a solid mix of local and international dishes

After staying nearly three months, Fairway Colombo truly became a second home. The service consistency, warm staff, and thoughtful touches made every day pleasant. I will absolutely return and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Colombo for business or leisure.

This is a No Star Hotel,

Don't wish anyone esle to go thru this.....

After excellent experience in various hotels in Sri Lanka at Bentota, Kanday, etc, we are going thru this horrible hotel, atrocious staff at Fairway Hotel in Colombo.

1. We were asked to leave from dinner hall located on 9th floor by one of the waiters named Silva. Pic of my untouched dinner plate and the waiter -Silva is attached here. See his expression talking to hotel guests.

Seems, guests with appetite for insults are welcome here.

2. This hotel doesn't provide bathroom slippers. Given the level of service or rather lack of it, they should provide boots!

3. Rooms are too small . If ur above 5'-8"" This hotel is not for you or ur family.

4. Staff at reception is too young & inexperienced. Be readyto help yourself, as these guys give guests directions to approach some other hotel staff to address needs!.

5. Hotel doesn't provide water . One has to buy water from hotel each time. Get ur water stock before you check in this hotel!

6.Dont waste time ordering for food from ur room, they don't serve anything!. U r expected to dial 3 different numbers , and keep check on all of them.....

My wife is still tracing my dinner food order with hotel staff at 11 at night!!!!

So good luck to u if u stay here !","Horrible & Atrocious","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d10750243-r1012439933-Fairway_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoardingPass303988","BoardingPass303988","C899F7B7DBA5726D33666DAAF3DD8605",,"776955","Jalgaon, India","Jalgaon","BoardingPass303988"

And we're so glad you enjoyed the bird-watching too; it's one of our much in-demand activities. While we are over the moon with all the positive aspects of your stay, we do regret the inconvenience you experienced with the coordination around activity arrangements. Clear communication between departments is essential, and it's disappointing to hear we fell short in that area. Your feedback serves as a timely reminder to reinforce this across the team, and we’re treating it as a valuable opportunity to improve.

It's wonderful to know you appreciated the breakfast spread and those wide, open views towards Sigiriya. For a hotel that's approaching three decades, Heritance Kandalama has aged rather gracefully, retaining the old elegance. As for our ever-curious neighbours, the monkeys do have a habit of helping themselves to anything left unattended, part of the charm and challenge of living so close to nature. Being mindful of this fact, we leave gentle reminders to be cautious. We’re glad you made the most of the in-house dining, and we hope the peaceful seclusion added to the experience rather than limiting it. We’d love to welcome you back for another visit.

Heritance is a destination hotel it was the one time in a 19 day tour we wished we had more time in the resort. I won't go into all the details about the place it is well documented, one of the things we really enjoyed was the wild life Monkeys and Birds at our backdoor especially in the morning. All rooms look out and are private we were lucky to be looking out to a bush covered slope full of wildlife. Not really a bucket list moment but sitting in the bathroom doing your morning business with a monkey 20 feet away looking at you is probably a once in a life time experience.

If you do stay here allow time to enjoy the resort great views, great wildlife, lovely infinity pool right next to a great little cafe and bar.

The hotel itself is stunning, blending seamlessly with nature, views, elephants and rocks. Rooms were good size, comfy bed and lovely bathroom.

The staff were helpful and courteous throughout our stay. 

Unfortunately the breakfast buffet was not good, 2 mornings the chicken curry not cooked properly.  The al-la carte dinner was mixed in with the buffet people, worst situation, horrible atmosphere  and the meals the smallest we have seen.  My husband was very hungry after the meal.

We decided on the second night to eat at the open air cafe and this was such a blessing.  Ambience perfect, food delicious and the food was top-notch with plenty of variety and excellent taste. So much better than upstairs.

We did face an very important issue during our stay.  There are no usb ports or spare electrical outlets anywhere in the rooms. We had to unplug a bedside lamp only to find our convertor was too large as the outlets were right on the floor, so usb cables could not be plugged in.  Contacted staff and they immediately bought us a special box to plug our cables into, which was appreciated.  Next morning senior management confirmed not all rooms had been renovated and they were a number of these rooms with the same issue. So beware if you are in one of those rooms.

The views were amazing from the hotel, we got to see the pools but because we were on tour and not at hotel until late each night we were unable to utilize them.

This hotel was one of the better ones of our tour.

However, we did face some discomfort during our stay due to the air conditioning in our room. It was a particularly hot season, and the AC was fixed at 28°C, which made the room quite warm and uncomfortable. Although the staff made efforts to resolve the issue, they couldn’t do much as it’s part of a central AC system.

Additionally, we noticed that common areas such as the Kanchana Lounge didn’t seem to be air-conditioned either—possibly due to low occupancy during this period—but it did make the heat a bit more noticeable.

Despite the AC issues, the hotel delivered in terms of service, food, and ambiance.

Because of our past experience I returned this year with my friends and family in a large group of 16 persons of whom 6 are over 70 years of age.

The design by Geoffrey Bawa is sheer genius. The unobtrusive presence of the hotel on the landscape and its apparent merger with its surroundings, it’s beautifully ventilated corridors and strategically positioned rooms along with its magnificently framed views make each visit more rewarding and revelatory than the last.

The service, the rooms and the food were as outstanding as ever. We were a large group with different dietary requirements and preferences, and the hotel took care to cater to each one of us individually. Not only this, the pasty chef Mr Thalin Malinda and the dining room manager Mr Sarath organised cakes to celebrate the birthdays of members of our group. The hotel tour by the naturalist and in-house hotel historian Mr Nalinda should not be missed. 

However, there is one incident which now endears this hotel to us even more and shows its special character. While on elephant safari over an hour away from the hotel a member of our party who has an external heart pump suddenly realised that she had only 40 minutes of battery life left and had forgotten her spare battery in her hotel room and without which she could not survive.

While she rushed from the elephant reserve to the hotel, the hotel manager Mr Gamini took the battery from her room and drove in his personal vehicle to meet the patient half-way and they managed to replace the depleted battery in the very nick of time even after the beeping had already begun.
This was service over and beyond the call of duty or any expectation we could’ve had!

If I could bestow this hotel the *best hotel in the world award* I would.

From the very beginning - planning everything a year in advance from abroad - the team was kind, responsive, and extremely professional. They helped us organize room blocks for our guests, finalize the venues and menus, and thoughtfully plan details for the wedding day.

Most of our guests stayed at the hotel for the week leading up to the wedding day, and it was truly a serene, one-of-a-kind setting that allowed everyone to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of Sri Lanka. The staff showed an exceptional level of care and hospitality the entire week - we’ve never experienced anything like it.

On the day of the wedding, everything went perfectly. The timeline was smooth, the logistics were seamless, and we felt fully supported from start to finish. We were able to truly be present and enjoy every moment.

We couldn’t be more grateful to the team for the experience they gave us as a couple and for the beautiful memories they helped create for all our guests. Highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a meaningful, well-executed wedding experience.

It’s a massive property, and the rooms were incredibly spacious—well beyond our expectations.

The only downside was the dining experience. The buffet, particularly during dinner, was quite average with limited variety. Many of the dishes had a subtle bitter aftertaste, which was a bit off-putting. Given the overall standard of the hotel, we had higher expectations for the food, but unfortunately, it didn’t quite deliver.

For a closer look, I made a tour available on YouTube search @theflyguyplus or ""Colombo’s Most Stunning Hotel View | Granbell Hotel Sri Lanka Review""

The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the city with gorgeous views of both the ocean and the skyline, especially from the rooftop pool and lounge area. The room was clean, modern, and well-kept by hardworking housekeeping staff.

That said, there were a few quirks worth mentioning for future guests. 

The in-room safe was far too small to fit a standard 13-inch laptop, which might be inconvenient if you're traveling with tech. And the front desk staff? Let’s just say they fully embraced “island time”...service was friendly but not always prompt. It added a bit of charm and humor to the stay.

If you're hoping to do remote work during your trip, this may not be the right hotel for you. The wi-fi in the room was quite weak, and there really wasn’t enough space in the common areas to set up a laptop comfortably or plug in for power. While the lobby and lounge areas had better Wi-Fi, they weren’t particularly designed for working.

Bottom line: This is a lovely hotel for a vacation or short stay with great ambiance and views. But if you need a solid work setup and fast in-room internet, you might want to consider other options.

Would I stay again for leisure? Yes.
Would I stay again to work remotely? Probably not.","Beautiful Views & Friendly Vibes – But Not Ideal for Remote Work","2024-10","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23958991-r1009209781-Granbell_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1026","779619030","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2e/78/0a/d6/caption.jpg","1024","0","20","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theflybyguyplus","theflybyguyplus","6E6833A737B05806D6D6FE48EEB26385",,,,,"theflybyguyplus"

The rooms are great, and whilst they may appear modest in size, they are very reasonably proportioned and more like mini-suites with walls providing separate sleeping, washing, and clutter areas.   I really liked the smart Japanese toilet and the wide windows everywhere, from which to admire the view.  
The bathroom is big – almost the size of the main sleeping area – complete with a wonderful large open rainfall shower and wide (but quite short) bath.  
The outdoor pool at the top (27th floor) is sensational – possibly the best infinity pool I have swam in, see picture. 

The restaurant is located on the 10th floor, which is smart as it not only provides a great ocean view but reduces the pressure on the lifts. Breakfast is good although a surprise not to see real (pork) bacon which is available in other Colombo hotels.
There are, however, two downsides and one irritant.  The lifts are a big downside,  – there are only four and they are enough, especially at peak periods.  The lift is a “smart lift” so when you get in after having waited a while, it actually apologises to you for the wait – which means it also knows the wait is too long. 
The second problem is that the location it is too close, almost on top of, the local train station and whilst this is great if you are a train geek, its not so good if you enjoy sleeping in the morning.  On one side of the building, you can hear the platform announcements, and your room is in the direct blast of the train’s horn which will reverberate through the windows – you cannot sleep through it.   However, on the other side of the hotel (low last numbers xx01 – xx07), it’s a different story, much quieter.  As you may have guessed, I changed room and it was so much better. 
And the irritant – it’s the glow from the room temperature controls in the wall. These are fine in the daytime, but at night its too bright, necessitating a sleep mask on night one and an improvised piece of paper over the screen on night two.","Wonderful","2025-05","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23958991-r1007002176-Granbell_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1564","509744697","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1e/62/16/39/717simonc.jpg","1564","294","798","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717simonc","Simon C","9CACE9D9288AB164642D8881D0E34D11",,"3442091","Ashtead, United Kingdom","Ashtead","717simonc"

Unfortunately the bed was very stiff and uncomfortable.

The room and common areas including the gym, rooftop pool and jacuzzi were all very clean! Service at the rooftop was quick and helpful, staff even helped me take a bunch of pictures which is always appreciated as a solo traveller! Roomservice was also good.

Service at the front desk was so-so. As I arrived the employee commented on how heavy my bag looked but did not offer help. Check-in took quite some time and when I went down to ask for a bathrobe I was told to go back to the room and call housekeeping. 

When leaving I had ordered the airport shuttle, I asked staff where the car would pick me up and they only said ""downstairs"". Went downstairs, asked several cars and a bus if they were the shuttle but the weren't. Also asked the employees by the garage but they did not speak English and couldn't help me. Had to go back upstairs to the reception only to recieve the plate number. While the employee was on the phone with the driver I asked for the color of the car, but she didn't ask and once again I had to go outside looking for the car. Finally an employee from the reception walked with me to find the car.

I booked the shuttle and paid more than doube a Pickme to ensure a smooth and comfortable transit. If I had a do-over I would have booked a Pickme as this would have been quicker and cheaper.

All in all a good stay, but don't expect too much hospitality.","Great view, okay service","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d23958991-r1005876432-Granbell_Hotel_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","21","130","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E_Ronja","Ronja","44B7C1794D346C1248D87F240A3CDE3E",,"189839","Malmö, Sweden","Malmö","E_Ronja"

We are truly grateful for your gracious review. It brings us immense joy to know that your visit with us was a memorable one.

Your kind words will be shared with Dhanajaya, Kelum and the entire team—they will be deeply honored by your recognition.

We would be delighted to welcome you back for another indulgent escape. During your next visit, we invite you to explore our signature dining destinations: 1864, Fire Beach, and Traveler’s Bar—each offering a curated culinary journey, thoughtfully designed to reflect the elegance and spirit of GFH.

We are also thrilled to share a glimpse of what’s new: our beloved King of the Mambo has undergone an inspired transformation and will be relaunching ""Queens of the Mambo"" - a night of Cuban Beats and Bold Flavors topped off with free flowing cocktails for the ladies!  Likewise, Fire Beach has being reimagined to elevate your seaside dining experience to extraordinary new heights.

We eagerly await the pleasure of your return, where luxury, warmth, and exquisite experiences await.

With sincere appreciation,

Noel – GFH

Greetings from Jetwing Lagoon Wellness! 

Thank you for your heartfelt and detailed review. We are delighted to hear that your stay not only met but exceeded your expectations in every way.

It’s wonderful to know that the tranquility of the resort, the care from our associates, and the attention to detail across every department made a positive impression. Your kind words about Nuwan, Sunetha, and our Ayurvedic doctors have been shared with them, and they are deeply touched. Our team always endeavors to offer genuine, personalized care, and it's rewarding to see their efforts recognized so thoughtfully.

We are delighted that you appreciated the holistic approach to wellness we strive for at Jetwing Lagoon Wellness, from the Ayurvedic consultations to the cuisine, and that you found the food both flavorful and healthy. It’s also great to hear how seamless your experience felt — our team enjoys ensuring the guest experiences flow naturally, and your feedback reassures us that we are on the right path.

Your observations about the warmth and attentiveness of the team — from security to housekeeping — are the kind of experience we hope every guest walks away with. We are honored by your recommendation and truly grateful that you have chosen to share your experience with friends, family, and customers.

We would be absolutely delighted to welcome you both back again in the future. Until then, we send our warmest wishes and gratitude.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

The resort is so tranquil,  the food is amazing,  the manorism of the the staff is out of this world, a total contrast to the attitude of most UK employees,  they literally can't do enough for you,  and their kind nature seems to come from the heart.

My Wife and I were treated by Nuwan and Sunetha in the Spa for the weeks duration. I have never met such peaceful and respectful people, what an amazing culture. 

Each morning we have traditional ayurvedic medicines and a consultation with the ayurvedic doctor, one of two doctors who are super friendly,  understanding and knowledgeable,  hey and guess what.....they don't kick you out after minutes,  you can converse with them for as long as you like and they tailor your days treated to suit , literally out of this world attitude to health and nutrition.  We now have both doctors WhatsApp details. The doctors literally could not believe how long it takes to get an appointment in the UK or that you can only have 5 minutes with a doctor per appointment.  The uk medical system needs a massive shake up

The attitude of the staff is the same throughout,  whether it is reception,  restaurant or kitchen,  everyone knows your name and room number. They always communicate between departments,  so if you book a tour,  they automatically adjust your meal time and treatment without you having to think about it.

The 100m pool is so clear and warm.

The room service is so quick and tidy

The food is next level flavoursome and super healthy.

Even security are friendly. 

Will definitely recommend to friends,  family and customers 😀","Body holiday amazing retreat","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d2510666-r1006922867-Jetwing_Lagoon_Wellness-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388731","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg","1200","21","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1250BAleet","Lee T","4787B564A91C39FE6FA099CCA71A1225",,"186364","Sheffield, United Kingdom","Sheffield","G1250BAleet"

Thank you for sharing such a wonderful review of your recent stay with us.

We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed the timeless charm of our historic hotel, along with the modern comforts we strive to provide. It's lovely to know that our location served as a convenient base for exploring Horton Plains and the surrounding tea country—two of the most scenic highlights in Nuwara Eliya.

We’re also thrilled that you had the opportunity to dine at several of our restaurants, enjoy our signature high tea, and savor a good cup of coffee at our coffee shop. Your appreciation of our beautifully maintained gardens is the cherry on top.

Thank you again for your kind words. We look forward to welcoming you back for another memorable visit.

When I first came in to the hotel I asked them whether all three meals will be on buffet, then they said they cannot confirm it but we will be able to change it if needed from half board to full board. So I made a half board booking. Today when I came to know that today’s lunch too will be a buffet, so went to the front desk and informed them to change it to Full Board basis, they said ok. After an hours time like they says that there accounts department had informed them that we cannot change the meal plan. So I requested them that I would like to speak with the Manager, they said he would meet me in 5mins. I stayed for 15mins but the manager did not come but one lady who was in the reception comes and says that the Hotel cannot Change a meal plan from Half board to Full board as there accounts department informs them. A very bad experience in one of the best hotels where even the Manager cannot come and solve a simple situation such as this and keeping guests waiting outside their office. The very reason that we have come here over the years is the hotels reliability, which seems to be down the drain now.","Worst Experience","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579206-r1006780992-The_Grand_Hotel_Nuwara_Eliya_Heritage_Grand-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"50","298458706","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/ca/1e/52/kushan-c.jpg","50","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kushanc2018","Kushan C","C0F773C69A87871BADF3048EC8B99007",,,,,"kushanc2018"

The extensive gardens are very lovely and very well maintained, a perfect feast for the eyes with flowers, well-manicured lawns and fountains. Our room was spacious with a nice view the gardens. We did not require a fan or AC because of the chill weather, but the room heater was useful during the cold nights. Bed was comfortable, amenities were good and the bathroom was spacious and modern with plenty of hot water. 
Staff at every level were good, efficient, courteous and very friendly. A small issue with a plug point in the room was attended to efficiently. Frazer and his concierge crew were brilliant, he helped us find transport to visit some local attractions. Staff at the restaurant were also very nice and helpful.
Food was exceptional at breakfast and dinner with a wide variety in the buffets. There were many dishes not commonly found at Sri Lankan hotel buffets and they were uniformly tasty. 
Highlight for us was the live music by Trio Topaz on Saturday night. Beautiful music, variety of tunes and styles and warm personalities of musicians, plus an unexpected guest spot by Umara. 
Few points to improve though - replace plastic water bottles with reusable glass bottles in the rooms, provide a non-slip bath mat in the shower tub, improve water pressure in the shower and train restaurant serving staff to be more attentive to customers and talk less among themselves.
Overall, a lovely hotel providing exceptional service and a very different experience.","Beautiful hotel and gardens, exceptional service and food","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579206-r1006135855-The_Grand_Hotel_Nuwara_Eliya_Heritage_Grand-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1440","675319588","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/40/8f/24/sharm77.jpg","1440","134","142","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharm77","Sharm","5F2C2D65195E9B2568D32EB42473CF35",,"2674028","Ragama, Sri Lanka","Ragama","Sharm77"

We also adored the rooftop pool, bar and garden, which was great for enjoying the sunset.

The breakfast was great there was a big selection of local and International food- all of it was freshly cooked and delicious.

The rooms are always beautifully clean and well-maintained. We especially love staying in the Signature Room with a stunning sea view – waking up to the ocean is pure bliss. 🌊🛏️

The housekeeping team is always efficient, friendly, and incredibly accommodating, and we find all the staff – from front desk to room service – to be warm, helpful, and professional. Their hospitality is truly unmatched.

Breakfast is another highlight – there's so much variety and flavor, it’s the perfect way to start the day. 🍳🥐☕

In the evenings, we love unwinding at the Sunset Bar – the view is breathtaking and it’s the perfect spot to enjoy a drink as the sun sets. 🌅🍹 And for a cosy, laid-back vibe, Floatz Pub on the 9th floor is a great place to relax and enjoy the night. 🍻🎶

From the beautiful rooms, stunning views, and top-notch facilities to the consistently friendly and accommodating staff, Marino Beach Colombo never fails to impress.

Mr. Sarath at the dining area was just as wonderful, always greeting us warmly and making sure we had everything we needed during every meal. The entire team made us feel genuinely cared for.

We stayed in both the Sigiriya Wing and Dambulla Wing, and each side had its own magic! If you’re a nature or wildlife lover, you will absolutely love the Sigiriya Wing. It’s surrounded by beautiful forest and feels like you’re part of nature itself. The Dambulla Wing, on the other hand, gave us breathtaking views of Kandalama Lake — a view we’ll never forget!

The food was absolutely delicious with a wide variety to choose from — every meal was a treat.

This was truly a memorable experience and we can't wait to come back! Thank you, Heritance Kandalama, for making our stay so special.

My stay at Heritance Kandalama was nothing short of extraordinary! Designed by the renowned architect Geoffrey Bawa, this eco-luxury hotel blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, offering a breathtaking experience in the heart of Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle.

Location & Ambience
Perched on the edge of the Kandalama Lake, this stunning hotel is surrounded by lush greenery, rocky cliffs, and abundant wildlife. The architecture is a masterpiece—built into the mountainside, making it feel like an extension of nature itself. The views of Sigiriya Rock Fortress in the distance add to the magic of this place.

Rooms & Comfort
The rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and offer spectacular lake or jungle views. The floor-to-ceiling windows bring nature right into the room. I woke up to the sound of birds and the sight of monkeys playing in the trees outside my balcony. The luxurious bathroom with a rain shower and a deep bathtub made my stay even more relaxing.

Dining Experience
The buffet at Kanchana Restaurant was one of the best I’ve experienced, offering a mix of Sri Lankan and international cuisine. The quality of the food, fresh ingredients, and live cooking stations made every meal special. The rooftop dining experience with panoramic views of the lake was truly unforgettable.

Facilities & Activities
Infinity Pools – The iconic infinity pool overlooking the jungle and lake is breathtaking, perfect for a relaxing swim.

Ayurvedic Spa – A must-try! The treatments were rejuvenating, set in a serene environment.

Nature Walks & Bird Watching – The hotel is home to many bird species, making it ideal for nature lovers.

Cycling & Excursions – The hotel organizes tours to Sigiriya, Dambulla Cave Temple, and Minneriya National Park for wildlife safaris.

Service & Hospitality
The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. Every request was met with a smile, and their hospitality made me feel truly welcome.

Best Time to Visit
The hotel is beautiful year-round, but the dry season (May to September) is ideal for sightseeing and wildlife experiences.

Overall Verdict
⭐ 5/5 – Heritance Kandalama is not just a hotel; it’s an experience. Whether you’re looking for luxury, nature, or culture, this hotel offers it all.

What an amazing place! The bedroom was roomy, cleaned daily  and the bed was very comfortable. The food was great with lots of different dishes  to choose from every day- I'm vegetarian and there was lots for me to choose from. There was masses for meat eaters too. 
All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly- nothing was too much trouble. Special thanks to Asanka and Modasanka who made sure our room was comfortable and clean- all the staff were gracious though, we just didnt catch their names!
 We tried all 3 swimming pools and found them all fab but would have appreciated some shaded areas around the poolside, but that is a small quibble as the ambience around all the pools was calm and peaceful-the views were good too. 
We really enjoyed seeing the monkeys ( macaques and langurs) from the balcony (and made sure to keep our balcony door locked when we were out as the macaques were very clever and determined little critters!).
We went on the jungle walk with Narinder, the resident naturalist and on another day took a tuk tuk to the Cave temples at Dambulla which are so beautiful. We also went to Pophams arboretum (near Dambulla) and thoroughly enjoyed our visit there. Just taking walks around the hotel and to the eco area  was enjoyable too.
We appreciated all the wildlife ( eg lizards, birds, butterflies) around the site and for us that was the 'icing on the cake' and ensured our stay gave us memories to last a lifetime.","Amazing hotel, fantastic food and gracious staff.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r1000668458-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452387558","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg","1200","0","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4516XNlesleyb","Lesley B","5FEC8BA00C53829056A70021AF3B12AA",,,,,"A4516XNlesleyb"

We had a wonderful stay at Marino beach hotel in Colombo. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with genuine warmth and kindness. The staff, especially in the restaurant area, were incredibly friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home throughout our stay.
The large infinity pool area was a highlight—beautifully maintained and perfect for relaxing while enjoying the peaceful, calm surroundings. The serene environment added to the overall experience, making it the ideal place to unwind and recharge. 

What made our experience even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff — they surprised us with a delicious cake for our anniversary. It was such a warm and personal touch that made us feel truly celebrated.
Highly recommended for anyone looking for great hospitality and a tranquil getaway.

Thank you for choosing The Grand Hotel for your 3-night stay and for taking the time to share such a thoughtful and comprehensive review.

We are truly delighted to know that you found our property “truly grand” — from the breathtaking grounds and charming architecture to the variety of dining options and the overall ambience. It’s heartening to hear that our reception team made a warm first impression and that you appreciated the comfort of our spacious rooms in the cool climes of Nuwara Eliya.

We also value your candid feedback regarding the service at the à la carte restaurant and breakfast buffet. Please accept our sincere apologies for the lapse in attentiveness you encountered. This is certainly not reflective of the high standards we strive to uphold, and your comments have been shared with our operations team to ensure improvements are made.

Thank you once again for your kind words and constructive insights. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back for an even more seamless experience in the near future.

Warm regards,
The Management

The grounds are nothing short of amazing and are the first thing you notice when you drive up to the hotel.

The reception staff were welcoming and this is where you start to get a taste of the old world charm of the hotel. It rambles over 3 wings and 3 floors with lots of different nooks and crannies all oozing charm.

The rooms were large and comfortable. Although  there is no air conditioning or fan it is not really needed in the cool climate.

There are quite a few eating options with the a large dining room buffet, separate Al a Carte restaurant, Thai (downstairs); and an Indian Restaurant and Cafe in the gardens. We tried the Indian , the  Al a Carte and the Cafe and found the food very good.

The only slight disappointment is the service staff at the Al a Carte and Breakfast Buffet. The service was okay but not what you would expect of a luxury hotel. At times the staff were often inattentive, missing in action or chatting to other staff. At breakfast only one waiter was serving tea and coffee in a very large dining room and I found I was not the only guest chasing a staff member down to try and get my coffee in the morning. This did not however detract much from our overall stay (just something for management to address)","Truly a Grand Experience","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d579206-r1005451282-The_Grand_Hotel_Nuwara_Eliya_Heritage_Grand-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,,,,,"106","108","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703grahamr","Graham R","C3DF14C892A4D0DCC5141D578F870C7F",,"255068","Brisbane, Australia","Brisbane","703grahamr"

Greetings from Jetwing Lagoon Wellness!

Thank you for sharing your review. We are thrilled to hear that your stay at Jetwing Lagoon Wellness was both calming and comfortable, and that you felt well taken care of throughout your stay.

It’s great to know that Chef Danushka’s meals left a lasting impression — I’m sure he will be pleased to hear your feedback. We are also glad to hear your comments about Indika and Nuwan at our wellness center, and I’ll be sure to pass along your compliments to them as well.

I’m equally glad that Imashi and Malindu’s service added to your overall positive experience and I’m sure they will be touched by your recognition.

Thank you again for recommending us, and we look forward to welcoming you back to Jetwing Lagoon Wellness to unwind and reset.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

herzlichen Dank, dass Sie sich die Zeit genommen haben, Ihre Eindrücke Ihres erneuten Aufenthalts im Jetwing Blue mit uns zu teilen. Es freut uns außerordentlich, dass wir Sie auch bei dieser Reise wieder von unserem Haus überzeugen konnten.

Ein besonderes Dankeschön für Ihre wertschätzenden Worte über unsere Teammitglieder. Es erfüllt uns mit großer Freude zu hören, dass Sie sich durch Niroshan so herzlich betreut gefühlt haben. Sein Engagement, seine Freundlichkeit und sein hoher Anspruch an Servicequalität spiegeln genau die Werte wider, für die wir bei Jetwing stehen. Wir werden Ihr Lob mit großer Freude an ihn weitergeben.

Ebenso bedanken wir uns für die freundliche Erwähnung von Rochell und Benoit aus dem Guest Relations Team. Dass Sie sich durch sie nicht nur professionell, sondern auch persönlich gut aufgehoben fühlten – und sogar in Ihrer Muttersprache Benoit kommunizieren konnten – freut uns ganz besonders.

Ihre Anregung hinsichtlich einer festen Zuordnung von Roomboy und Servicekräften während des gesamten Aufenthalts nehmen wir gerne auf und prüfen dies im Rahmen unserer Qualitäts- und Serviceoptimierung.

Es war uns eine Ehre, Sie erneut bei uns begrüßen zu dürfen, und wir hoffen sehr, Sie bald wieder im Jetwing Blue willkommen zu heißen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us. We deeply regret to hear that your stay at Jetwing Blue did not meet your expectations, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and discomfort you encountered.

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the condition of the room upon your arrival and for the flooding caused by the blocked balcony drain during the heavy rainfall. This is certainly not the experience we aim to provide our guests, and we are truly sorry for the distress it caused you.

We take all guest feedback very seriously and have already addressed the drainage issue with our maintenance team to ensure that such occurrences are prevented in the future. Additionally, we are reviewing our room inspection protocols to guarantee that rooms are fully secured and in optimal condition before guest check-in.

We understand how frustrating it must have been to deal with these issues, especially after a long journey, and we are very sorry that we failed to offer the comfort and care that our guests deserve. Your experience is not reflective of the standards we strive to uphold, and we are taking your comments as an opportunity to improve.

Should you consider giving us another chance, we would be grateful for the opportunity to offer you a more pleasant and restful stay.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback following your recent stay with us. We are truly delighted to hear that you enjoyed the stunning main pool, the extensive breakfast buffet, and the warm hospitality of our team.

We’re especially pleased that our staff could assist your husband promptly with his dental needs and support you with your lost reading glasses. It’s heartening to know that our team, including members from Customer Relations and the dining room, made a positive impression on your experience. A special thank you for highlighting Fernando at the pool – we will be sure to share your kind words with him and the rest of the team.

We also appreciate your constructive comments regarding the bathroom cleanliness and the lighting on the internal staircase near room 228. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the mould in the shower and the condition of the rattan blinds – we understand how important attention to detail is and have addressed these concerns with our housekeeping team. The lighting issue has been reported to our engineering department to prevent future incidents. We also hope your husband’s ankle is recovering well.

Take the half board option, and try to secure a room in the Sigiriya wing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We stayed three nights in a Luxury Room in the Sigiriya Wing. The Heritance Kandalama is a massive and incredibly unique hotel - over 900 metres from one end of the Dambulla wing to the other end of the Sigiriya wing. 

The hotel is incredibly popular with large tourist groups (coaches and coaches worth) so if you are planning to stay here, book very early. We had a lot of difficulty securing a room at the hotel and were unable to book directly as they were sold out. We secured a room via a third party site, but not the one we were hoping for. We were on the third floor and had a partial lake and Sigiriya view. 

We had an issue with our room upon arrival (despite at least five pre arrival emails to the hotel), however it was resolved quite quickly after check in. 

The rooms are dated, but very comfortable and with good amenities. Everything worked fine and the AC and the bedding were great. The different types of resident monkeys visited our balcony and outside our bathroom daily which we quite enjoyed. 

The property and gardens / landscaping are beautiful and extremely unique. The infinity pool has incredible views over the lake and towards Sigiriya and the rooftop pool with the base of the pool the bed rock the hotel is built on is extremely unique and very cool. 

As the hotel has so many tour groups, it is very busy early in the mornings and in the evening, but super quiet and peaceful during the day when they are out.

We did the half board option which is highly advisable considering the isolated lakeside location. Breakfast was great every day, even when very busy with a good range of options. Dinner was great the first night, however the quality and range of options was a little poor on the second and third nights. 

We arranged transport out to Sigiriya for sunrise and for an elephant safari through the hotel and both were fantastic with good quality drivers and vehicles.

We found all staff at the hotel absolutely exceptional and friendly. The hotel bar charges in rupees which makes drink prices quite reasonable. 

We would absolutely recommend the Heritance Kandalama and really enjoyed our stay.","Heritance Kandalama brilliance","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d315685-r998219411-Heritance_Kandalama-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","29","94","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petergY9057JV","Peter G","C9D25E938AD56FE83BED5F4C7AD6A68A",,,,,"petergY9057JV"

From the moment we arrived, we were in awe of the striking architecture—this hotel is truly one of the most beautiful buildings we’ve ever seen. Designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa, it is perfectly sympathetic to the surrounding forest, blending seamlessly with nature and offering breathtaking views at every turn.

The food at Heritance Kandalama was amazing—a brilliant buffet. The variety was exceptional, and the quality was even better. We particularly loved the hoppers, daal, and the delicious selection of breads and fruits. There were also plenty of international food options for those who wanted them, ensuring that everyone’s tastes were satisfied. Every meal felt like a treat, and we enjoyed trying the local specialties every day.

The hotel’s three pools were a highlight, with the infinity pool offering the most breathtaking views of the nearby lake. It was the perfect place to unwind and take in the serene, peaceful surroundings. The entire hotel felt like an oasis—lush, beautiful, and incredibly calming. We spent time relaxing by the pools, soaking in the views, and enjoying the natural beauty all around us.

The nature surrounding the hotel is extraordinary. We loved watching the monkeys play and observing the wild birds that seemed to be everywhere. The sounds of the forest added a peaceful ambiance, making it easy to relax and feel truly connected to the environment. And the sunsets! They were simply incredible, casting a golden glow over the lake and the forest, creating a memory we’ll cherish forever.

The service at Heritance Kandalama was another standout feature. The staff were brilliant—professional, friendly, and attentive. They clearly take pride in their work and are great ambassadors for the hotel. This was our first experience of Sri Lanka, and we couldn’t have been made to feel more welcome. The staff were not only helpful but also genuinely interested in us, always going the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and their warm hospitality made our stay even more memorable.

We also had the privilege of experiencing some incredible nearby attractions. One of the standout experiences was walking with a monk. This meditation experience, where we visited caves and received the monk’s wisdom on the side of a mountain, was truly moving. It was a privilege to be in such a breathtaking setting and learn about Sri Lankan culture and spirituality.

We also climbed Sigiriya and Pidurangala, both of which were unmissable. While the sites can be crowded, the views from the top, especially at sunset, were absolutely worth it. The Dambulla caves, with their ancient and solemn atmosphere, made us feel like we were stepping back in time. The sense of history surrounding us was palpable, and we felt privileged to visit these sacred places.

Overall, Heritance Kandalama provided the perfect setting for a peaceful retreat—luxurious, connected to nature, and full of exceptional experiences. The combination of striking design, amazing food, brilliant service, and the chance to connect with nature made this stay unforgettable. We absolutely loved every moment and can’t wait to return.

The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff were truly exceptional. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to outstanding service. Elwin helped us with the check-in process and graciously gave us a tour of the property, including the charming herb garden and a visit to the rooftop—just in time to witness a stunning sunset.

Unfortunately, the dining experience fell well below expectations. We had booked a half-board package, but after trying the dinner buffet on the first night, we chose to dine elsewhere at our own expense for the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was equally underwhelming—disappointingly, even a simple omelette wasn’t prepared well. We struggled to find a single dish that was enjoyable at either meal.

While the hospitality and overall ambiance deserve high praise, the quality of the food significantly detracted from our experience. I sincerely hope management addresses this issue, as it prevents an otherwise excellent hotel from earning a full five stars.","Pleasant Stay with Outstanding Staff, But Disappointing Food","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g644047-d23262280-r1011799981-Araliya_Beach_Resort_Spa-Unawatuna_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","1","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suresh_1417","Suresh R","191400DD3CAB29ED6B8CB435B73A5E65",,"4358015","Applecross, Australia","Applecross","suresh_1417"
