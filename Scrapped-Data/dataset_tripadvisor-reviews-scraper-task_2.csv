From the spacious, well-designed rooms to the tranquil infinity pool and stunning views, everything about this 5-star property made our stay feel truly special and relaxing.","Perfect blend of luxury and nature, with warm, attentive service and delicious food","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r1011904097-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,"959","708708489","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2a/3e/08/89/rmj-c.jpg","959","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636rmjc","Rmj C","5D06873584AB21BD4E98D47B745643A5",,"668534","Kurunegala, Sri Lanka","Kurunegala","636rmjc"

We are truly heartbroken and deeply sorry that your experience at Jetwing Lake was one of distress and violation. What you endured is unacceptable, and no guest should ever have to face such a situation especially not within the space that should offer complete privacy and comfort.

While no apology can undo the pain caused, we want to assure you and all future guests that this incident was treated with the utmost seriousness at the highest levels of our organisation.

The team member involved was immediately terminated, and the full cost of your stay was refunded. Our Managing Director personally reached out to express our deepest apologies, and a formal review of our protocols was launched across all Jetwing properties.

As a family-run company with over 50 years of service, our people have always been our greatest strength — but in this case, we failed to uphold the values we stand for. Your courage in sharing this, despite your pain, will help us do better. It is our responsibility to ensure that no other guest ever feels unsafe or disrespected under our care.

We remain sincerely sorry, and we thank you for giving us the opportunity to address this however difficult it may be.

Ayubowan! (May you live a long life!)

Nalin Herath
Manager

I hesitated to share this out of embarrassment, but I believe it’s important for future guests to be aware, especially solo female travelers or groups of women.

During my stay, while I was in the shower, a male housekeeping staff member entered my room. Despite the unmistakable sound of running water, he proceeded to go deeper into the room and look through the clear glass door, seeing me in a state of complete vulnerability. It was extremely evident that someone was in the shower, but he wanted to look anyway. The sense of violation and trauma I felt in that moment is hard to put into words. I wanted to leave immediately, but it was our last night there so I just told myself to get through this one night.

The hotel’s initial response was wholly inadequate. They offered to comp our dinner and “upgrade” me to a similar room with a larger balcony and better view, as if that could somehow rectify what had happened. It wasn’t until after my tour agent intervened did the hotel refund the full cost of my stay.

The follow-up correspondence from the hotel’s General Manager included the usual assurances: that this was an isolated incident, and that staff training would be improved. While I truly hope they follow through on these promises, I feel that basic staff protocols, such as not entering a room when someone is in the shower, should not require additional training. They are common sense. Please, do better.","Deeply Troubling Incident!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r1011737435-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","27","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilohapril","April W","F657C3FF1CAB4F522F38C2D37A510A8F",,"298570","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kuala Lumpur","aprilohapril"

The hotel is big but it manages to keep a very personal approach to the clientele and, as with most of Sri Lanka, you are greeted by friendly staff with huge smiles!!  Our group were accommodated in rooms away from the main building which are spacious and well equipped.  Because some of them are quite a walk from the main building there is a fabulous service where you are taken to and collected from your room.  The walk  to the rooms is a pleasant one past the lake and through the trees where you will see many birds and small animals but after a long day sightseeing the lift to your room is very welcome!!

I was  unwell one day and stayed at the hotel and was visited 4 times (!!!) by 2 different doctors.  The attention I had was amazing.  After leaving the hotel I had messages from the female doctor, Iranga, asking if I was better and enjoying my holiday.  The Reception Manager, Imalka, who always came to the room to see me with the doctor, also text me during the rest of my trip to ask if I was ok and enjoying the trip.  Amazing and thank you to them both!!!!  Your kindness will never be forgotten.

Rooms were serviced well, the food was good, the location was stunning and very convenient for visiting all the various sights in the area and all the staff were truly exceptional.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Sri Lanka but what really did make it special were the Sri Lankan people themselves and nowhere epitomised this more than at the Anantara.All the staff from those working on the grounds through cleaners,restaurant staff to front of house were friendly,helpful and usually happy to engage in conversation.You are made to feel especially welcome when dining at Journeys where we enjoyed chatting with Tachila,Thisari and others,often fairly new staff but very pleased to be working there.The manager of the pool bar,Greshan,was probably the nicest person we met in Sri Lanka and his story of surviving the tsunami we will never forget,thanks for the G&T’s!Likewise to the ‘beach boys’ Nuwan,Heshan and others who ensured our place on the grass for sundowners and just couldn’t stop smiling and laughing.Great guys.Front of house was Thisal who was at the end of all our WhatsApp’s sorting out laundry,drinks and every other request.Thanks
The grounds are immaculately kept with people sweeping from sunrise to sunset and contain many different trees,shrubs and plants as well as animals and birds,well worth taking a closer look at to appreciate.Don’t miss the man who climbs the impossibly high palm trees with just a bit of rope between his feet,chopping down coconuts.
The whole complex sweeps close to the shoreline and is bookended by the Il Mare Italian style restaurant high up overlooking the cliffs and wonderful on an evening to Verala Asian themed restaurant shaped to mimic 2 coconut shells and very impressive.We ate there 3 times and were expertly looked after by Rizvi enjoying watching the chefs with their clanging blades making the kotthu or other specials.
The beach in front of the hotel can be challenging to swim in and not for the inexperienced but the adjacent public beach Goyambaku is safer but still great fun for bodyboarding.
Our all inclusive package allowed us a one hour spa treatment which is very classy and we also enjoyed the high tea experience.I wanted to try a surfing lesson and the hotel have a company called Tropic surf which is located on site and run by Shaun and Lainey which take you to a safe and quiet beach some 20 minutes away by tuktuk.Great fun,very tiring but no good if you’re 63 and unfit!
The Anantara is very much a 5 star experience.","5 Star experience","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r938397950-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","1","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion459387","Companion459387","AF3F03D5E928E6DDE4A60957A4C30D8F",,,,,"Companion459387"

There are places you visit... and then there are places that live on in your heart long after the journey ends. My stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle was, without a doubt, one of the latter—a soul-soothing, heartwarming experience that lingered well beyond the check-out date.

Please forgive the delay in sending this note; due to the whirlwind of a demanding schedule, I was unable to share my reflections sooner. Yet not a single day has passed without fond memories rising gently to the surface—the sound of waves echoing through the palms, the taste of spice-laced southern cuisine, and the unforgettable warmth of your team’s hospitality.

From the very first moment I arrived, I was enveloped in a sense of serenity and grace. The resort didn’t just meet expectations—it quietly, elegantly redefined them. There’s a rare kind of magic at Anantara Peace Haven—one that lies not only in its sweeping views of the Indian Ocean or its lush, fragrant gardens, but in its people. It is your team that turns luxury into something profoundly human.

I must extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Ms. Thisari Nawoda, whose leadership and attentiveness infused every element of my stay. Ms. Thisari is not only a consummate professional but also a true ambassador of Sri Lankan hospitality. Her ability to anticipate needs, resolve requests with poise, and engage guests with genuine warmth is a gift few possess. It was clear to me that she doesn't just manage a resort—she nurtures an experience. Her quiet presence seemed to ripple through the team, creating an atmosphere of calm attentiveness and joy.

To the incredible staff, whose names I wish I had written down one by one, you each made me feel as though I were the only guest on the property. From the gentle housekeepers who maintained my villa with care and respect, to the smiling faces at breakfast who remembered my coffee preferences without being told twice, every detail felt personal. Not scripted, not rehearsed—real.

What truly stood out was the flexibility and thoughtfulness offered during my stay. Despite arriving with a somewhat unpredictable schedule and changing needs, your team never once made me feel like an inconvenience. Whether it was adapting meal times, arranging transport at odd hours, or simply offering a quiet space for me to catch my breath, your collective grace was unwavering.

The villa itself—an oasis of comfort—was designed not just to impress, but to restore. The harmony between refined architecture and natural beauty created a space that felt both elevated and grounding. Every sunrise I watched from that private terrace was like a quiet promise that all would be well.

And the cuisine... what a journey that was! Each meal was a celebration—vibrant, soulful, rooted in the local soil yet layered with creativity. Your chefs are not merely cooks; they are storytellers, serving chapters of southern Sri Lanka on every plate. I felt nourished not only in body, but in spirit.

As I look back, what touches me most is that Anantara Peace Haven never tried to “impress” in the way many luxury resorts often do. Instead, you chose to connect—to the guest, to the land, to the moment. And that is where your true magic lies.

Please accept my sincerest thanks, not just for the unforgettable stay, but for the way you made me feel—seen, cared for, and at peace.

To Ms. Thisari Nawoda and every team member whose efforts made my stay so special, thank you. I carry your kindness with me.","A Long Overdue Note of Heartfelt Gratitude","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304142-d8116054-r1013083516-Anantara_Peace_Haven_Tangalle_Resort-Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",,"2048","808144125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/2b/4c/fd/caption.jpg","2048","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer24083070679","Sahan Mackenzie","6158F94E7DC4A8F1D6E87916322D8E11",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Explorer24083070679"

There are a host of activities throughout the day which are complimentary and one of the best experiences was the morning nature walk with Rashmi; a marine biologist who does discovery tours working with the resort.

The property is big, and it has a classy and luxurious feel. It is very well maintained.

All the staff members are extremely friendly and welcoming, which immediately sets the tone for a pleasant stay.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Upgrading to a club room makes sense as it gives you access to the very comfy lounge on the 9th floor.

The hotel offers many dining options to cater to different palets. The food is delicious throughout these different venues.

They have 2 swimming pools. Both are big and very well maintained. Great for kids and adults alike.

The hotel is connected to a mall, which makes it very convenient when you have small things to buy to keep in the room.

One of the things we liked the most in this hotel is that it is children-friendly. We could take our 6 year old son wherever we wanted in the hotel, without having to worry about age restrictions.

All together, a great hotel that I highly recommend!","A great hotel to stay in Colombo!","2025-06","NONE","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r1015507773-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"960","92577431","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/84/9e/97/anand-pakiam.jpg","757","5","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anand_Pakiam","Anand Pierre P","EB62AD261A986A035F6AAC524C93A1D3",,,,,"Anand_Pakiam"

It is situated on top of a hill with spectacular views of the surrounding countryside and tea plantations.
The facade of the building is as it was when built. The interior has had a refurbishment and the accommodation rooms made bigger from the original but still in style with the original.
Staff are attentive with immaculate uniforms and always helpful.
R. Thanushan in the Hethersett Bar went over and above with his service.
Pathmaraj has been with the Heritance for 29 years and gave us a wonderful tour of the gardens under his control.
Absolutely immaculate.
The downside is the hotel is in the middle of nowhere with a very narrow road leading to it. Unless you had access to a tuk-tuk you are stuck there. The accommodation was included in our trip however the food was very expensive for the quality and quantity. Hotel very over staffed as well.","Stepping back in time","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r1011158497-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","7","15","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithfT4476KM","Judith F","0ACBD3FDDCEE5B11788BAEBE1F901E0E",,,,,"judithfT4476KM"

The rooms were spacious and well equipped...comfortable bed.  The roof top bar had a fantastic view of the city and Lotus Tower.
A good sized gym with plenty of space,  machines and weights.
The pool was absolutely beautiful,  clean and big with a beautiful sea view.  
The staff throughout were so helpful.  Devna at reception was wonderful and helped us to get a few hours extended on our departure at no extra charge...this helped so much! She also showed us how to join a site that had hotels all over the world that we could stay in and earn point and get discounts on our food and beverage...lovely lady!!!

I had the pleasure of staying at Cinnamon Red, and I must say that it truly exemplifies the best of Sri Lankan hospitality. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff who were always ready to assist with a smile. The hotel’s central location in the heart of Colombo made it incredibly convenient for exploring the city, yet it still felt like a peaceful retreat after a long day.

A special mention goes to Thiloka at the front desk. Her helpfulness, knowledge, and genuine understanding of guest relations were simply outstanding. She went above and beyond to ensure my stay was as comfortable as possible, providing excellent recommendations and handling every request with grace and professionalism. Thiloka is a shining example of what makes Cinnamon Red such a wonderful place to stay.

If you’re looking for a hotel with exceptional service, a great location, and true Sri Lankan hospitality, Cinnamon Red is the perfect choice.

We booked in advance and paid half of the total cost to book a table for 10. When we went restaurant was packed and we didn’t have a table reserved!! Waiters there said another group sat on our already reserved table so they will prepare another table and give us. The whole concept of reservation is that customers don’t have to wait. Eranga who came to us with a massive attitude saying why can’t you’ll wait for 5 minutes and asked me not to make a scene and keep quiet. Very disappointed about the customer service and how we were treated when it’s their fault not reserving a table after paying for it. Management should train their staff on how to talk to customers.

As someone who makes it a habit to catch up on both national and international news each day, having access to television news is an essential part of my routine no matter where I am.

On the second morning of my stay, I realized that the television in my room wasn’t functioning properly, likely due to poor signal caused by the rainy weather in Colombo. While it was an understandable issue given the conditions, I hoped it could be resolved.

That’s when I met Mr. Gayan, the room boy assigned to the 20th floor, where I was staying. From the very beginning, Mr. Gayan left a positive impression. On my first day, he greeted me warmly in the morning, checked in to see if the room was in order, and made me feel genuinely welcome.

The following day, I happened to see him near the lift and casually mentioned the issue with the TV. Without hesitation and without needing any technical support, Mr. Gayan came to my room and quickly fixed the problem. I was truly impressed by his initiative, skill, and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure guests have a comfortable experience.

It was in that moment I realized how talented and multi-skilled the staff at Cinnamon Red truly are. Mr. Gayan is a shining example of hospitality done right a professional who not only understands his role but embodies the values of care, efficiency, and excellence.

Overall, my stay at Cinnamon Red was truly enjoyable. The food was exceptional, the ambience was refreshing, and above all, the staff were remarkably attentive and genuinely kind. Thanks to people like Mr. Gayan, my stay became a truly memorable one.","A Memorable Stay at Cinnamon Red – Thanks to a Remarkable Employee","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r1014076525-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388955","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chandulah2025","Chandula H","2AABECCABAD0C7B1A2B174771A316399",,"293961","Sri Lanka","Sri Lanka","chandulah2025"

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with grace and warmth. The resort is breathtaking — surrounded by nature, beautifully landscaped, and set against the backdrop of the stunning southern coastline. It offered the perfect balance of luxury, tranquility, and Sri Lankan charm.

Our room was spacious, spotless, and elegantly decorated, with thoughtful honeymoon touches that made us feel truly special. The view from our balcony was absolutely serene, and every detail reflected the resort’s world-class standards.

The food was exceptional — from breakfast to dinner, every meal was a delight. We also loved the range of activities and the peaceful atmosphere of the pool and gardens. Most of all, we were touched by the kindness and professionalism of the staff, who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable, relaxing, and memorable.

The facilitates are lovely and the sunset pool was great for us as a couple, however as this is the adult pool maybe more policing is needed. The room was nice however we did have a small critter problem with a large insect found in the bed and quite a few insects around the room. 

We were staying over the Sri Lankan New Year which the hotel had on events for, this led to the hotel being very busy and might have caused some of the problems we faced such as a lack of service (waiting a very long time for drinks and meals, along with the problems from housekeeping). We booked day trips through the hotel which were good however overpriced and the day tours were just drivers and whilst friendly enough were not particularly knowledgeable about where we were going and maybe a lack of communication between the hotel and drivers along with rather over-enthusiastic descriptions of the trips. 

The hotel recommended a city tour of Hambantota which consisted of the botanical gardens and bird zoo which we were unaware of, we had to pay 4,500 as foreigners for the bird zoo, which turned out to be birds in small cages - we did not enjoy this. The driver then told us the botanical gardens had a long wait time and he didn’t recommend it, so we paid $60 to be driven to two locations only 15 minutes away, one of which was very disappointing. 

The food was average, as a vegetarian there was a lack of options to choose from at some of the restaurants, however a good dinner buffet selection. The Sera is quite overpriced especially considering the quality of food we received. 

The grounds are beautifully maintained and the safaris are worthwhile as there is fantastic nature. I would recommend as a short stay for the safaris.","Good for a short stay","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1015317684-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",,"1018","736139712","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e0/99/c0/caption.jpg","1014","5","41","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9894DValiciab","Alicia V","CFBB1B2471D63B589CA95497BE2D599A",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","W9894DValiciab"

We booked a suite category room with an ocean view and the disappointment began there...the ocean from our room was barely visible...and upon frequent calls n discussions they gave another room just above the room provided...now what we can see is a trace of ocean n that too at a distance...
Also it was located at a noisy place near the pool, we wanted a peaceful place to reside in...so we had to adjust in the room which 
1. Does not offer an ocean view 
2 located at a noisy place...
The image updated on the website, does not match the room we checked in...

As it was a vacation, we let it go as we didn't want to spoil our mood. 
We are vegetarians and mentioned that at the time of booking and check in. If a 5 star property is accepting bookings for vegetarians then they should make proper arrangements for the Indian vegetarian guests... unfortunately their Indian chef was on leave and we could not find anything on the menu that can be eaten by us, except a cheese pizza..
One night for dinner we had that barely as we are not pizza lovers, second night we again got a pizza but it came 45 min post giving na order n that too very cold as if someone forgot to serve it...
 The food was the biggest challenge in the hotel, it is at a remote location so a tuk tuk or a cab does not come easily. The hotel charges hefty if we book a car through them. Hospitality and service is 0 especially at restaurants. 
What one expects from a hotel, a classy room with a great view, good food and hospitality, especially when you book a higher category rooms, which charges 30k-35k INR per night.

Pathetic Rude Staff",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our experience at Shangri-La Hambantota was far from what one expects from a luxury resort and left us with a lasting sense of frustration and disbelief.
We were travelling with young children after a 12-hour journey, hoping for a smooth and welcoming check-in. Instead, we were met with one of the most disorganized and poorly managed check-ins we’ve ever encountered. Despite informing the hotel in advance and requesting an expedited process, there was simply no manpower or urgency from the staff. Mr. Kamindu at the front desk was completely clueless and indifferent, showing little regard for basic hospitality. When we requested an upgrade, he first claimed there was no availability and moments later said upgrades were available for a price—an inconsistency that spoke volumes about their priorities.
The rooms allocated to us were at the very end of a long corridor, at least a 5-minute walk from the lobby—highly inconvenient for a family with small kids. Worse, the rooms were in noticeably poor condition and in no way reflected five-star quality.
When we raised these concerns with the duty manager, Mr. Lakmal, the situation only deteriorated. Instead of listening or showing any sense of accountability, he was rude, dismissive, and shockingly arrogant. He refused to help, refused to acknowledge the genuine concern of accessibility for a family with children, and instead blamed us for not requesting a “more convenient room” at the time of booking. He even had the audacity to suggest we pay for a higher category room if we wanted basic convenience.
It was a masterclass in how not to handle guest issues. Mr. Lakmal’s attitude was not just unprofessional—it was shameful for someone representing a global hospitality brand. Basic courtesy, empathy, and common sense were completely absent.
This experience has not only left us disappointed but also deeply disillusioned with the Shangri-La brand. What should have been a relaxing family getaway was marred by sheer negligence, apathy, and arrogance from key staff.","Extremely Disappointing Stay – Arrogant Management & Substandard Service","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1013906528-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",,,,,,"0","14","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162atits","Atit S","26A0091F0AE263CABEC80929725AA5A0",,,,,"162atits"

In general, THAT OPINION HAS NOT CHANGED! 

The service provided by the entire staff, from Housekeeping, Dining, Bar, Pool and Reception right up to the senior management has, once again, been outstanding, so whilst not wishing to ignore any of those people, I will say a very sincere personal ""Thank you"" to Lahiru and Keshara, together with those other members of the Housekeeping Team, who went the extra mile to maintain our large suite (TY also for the upgrade!), at the earliest opportunity when I took my wife out onto the balcony to clear the room. I must also add my thanks to Receptionist Nadee, who actively helped throughout both our stays to date, and in my planning of this second stay, and for taking the time to talk directly to my wife at every opportunity to ensure that she was being well looked after by the whole team.

Notwithstanding all that effort, the overall management of our holiday by Riu Head Office (HO) turned into a farce. First off, our Emirates flight from Birmingham UK was cancelled following a heavy landing by the arriving EK39, so we were provided with hotel accommodation overnight and flew on EK40 the following day. As soon as I knew that we were not flying as scheduled, I contacted Riu HO and advised them of the delay.

Unfortunately, when we finally got to Sri Lanka, I discovered that our Riu HO booked transfer had not been rescheduled; indeed, I learned later that the taxi for our original arrival had waited on time and we had been logged as a ""no show"". After almost 3 hrs waiting in the Arrivals area of the airport, the hotel staff kindly sorted a replacement transfer, so we arrived at the hotel well over a day late.

With our previous stay in mind, and a further kind upgrade to exactly the same suite which has a large sea- and pool-facing L-shaped balcony,  I asked for the pool staff to provide a beach bed on the balcony, to allow my wife to relax without having to negotiate the other guests around the pool area. I was rather surprised to hear that it wasn't now Riu HO policy for beds to be used on guests’ balconies, regardless of personal circumstances! 

As a company based in the European Union, I am sure that Riu must be aware of the need to acknowledge Disability and Accessibility legislation, so it seems petty that they cannot address a simple topic such as this on a case by case basis. Might I suggest that the simple expedient of providing a bed to any disabled guest is unlikely to cause any adverse comment from the rest of the guest population!

With my second 30 night stay, I have now become a Riu Diamond Class member, and have already booked a Summer stay with the Company in Cape Verde - let's hope that commonsense (if not the required duty-of-care!) prevails, and that we can gets the cooperation that my wife's condition warrants.

!n the meantime, my sincere thanks and best wishes for the future for all of you at the Riu Sri Lanka, and we do hope to see you all again soon💕😎👍

Please be aware that the ‘24 hour all inclusive’ offer is misleading- only one restaurant was open the night we went and the ‘all night’ restaurant consisted of a small cafe with left over dry sandwiches and pasta.

The dinner buffet at Rita Panna was terrible. Every single food item we tried was tasteless and bland. Even basic food such as calamari were chewy and overcooked. Moreover, there were flies circling the buffet food and staff took no interest when we pointed this out.

The staff were friendly, however the ambience was bizarre for a 5 star hotel.. we were surrounded by clowns and waiters in dress up costumes, we well amateur dancers in the dining area. This would be expected in a family style cruise ship, not a ‘5 star’ hotel. 
Staff were also constantly mopping and sweeping throughout the restaurant whilst we were dining.

The hotel is also catered towards Russian tourists. It felt like we were in a pub full of rowdy, drunk people; not a relaxing sea side resort.

On a positive note, the rooms were clean and spacious. And our request to check out the night we arrived due to our dissatisfaction was met by the hotel manager.","Disappointing, overpriced  and misleading","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1014329383-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391715","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg","1200","1","10","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sn_ds93","sn_ds93","7746454FA331B2D4B1FB66EC50982ADE",,"255100","Melbourne, Australia","Melbourne","sn_ds93"

Er lag dus veel rommel in het water er gaat ook nooit een stofzuiger over de bodem van het zwembad en ook nooit gezien dat het water wordt gecontroleerd. Dit zie je bij andere Riu hotels eigenlijk elke dag gebeuren.
Ook de keuze in eten was beperkt en ook niet echt smakelijk, behalve als je na 1 van de andere restaurants gaat die je moet reserveren.
Het personeel was wel echt heel vriendelijk dat moet gezegd worden.
Kamers waren ruim en zagen er prima uit.","Er zijn veel betere Riu hotels","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1013758517-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","2","30","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam40385643255","Roam40385643255","63003D9A72017CEEB59E5E4327EE7B98",,,,,"Roam40385643255"

The food was exceptional for an all inclusive and snacks were constantly available outside of normal meal times with amazing cocktails, beer and wine available practically 24/7.  
The facilities are amazing for children with a kids club catering for 4-12 year olds which our 3 loved and was ran by the lovely Madu who kept them entertained with crafting and games. There were also children's shows and discos in the early evenings. 
There are 3 pools, one for only adults with a swim up bar and a further children's pool with slides and waterfalls. 
The buffet food was amazing and a selection of local, and international with a noodle bar and Italian counter and a carvery with amazing selection of fruits and puddings at each sitting and wine, beer and soft drinks available at mealtimes with our glasses being topped up by the excellent Roshan and Sameera.  Our family was also made to feel special by Marshall who always took the time to make sure we had a table and were well taken care of.
our room was a family suite which was spacious with two twin beds and a large double with two bathrooms with a bath and walk in shower.  It was kept impeccably clean by our lovely cleaner Mayura who delighted the children every day with different towel animals.   
On our final day we were also granted a late checkout for free which was a nice touch. 
The hotel can get quite crowded on the weekends when many locals come to stay but this did not diminish our enjoyment and the only other minor point is all the floors in the hotel tend to be quite slippy which was a bit of a problem for my wife who was walking round on crutches after a knee injury. 
We did several trips while we were there, all organised by a tourist guide, Kamal, who is located at a stall outside the entrance to the beach.  He was much cheaper than many of the other tours offered and we had several amazing trips to buddhist temples, tea plantations, turtle sanctuaries and river safaris and he took great care our us and the children.  He can be contacted on 0094777-072608 and i would thoroughly recommend him for any trips. 
Finally there are shows every evening by the entertainment team which varied from local dancing to a rendition of grease!!!! and many local bands performing really good covers of popular songs.  
All in all the country of Sri Lanka was amazing with welcoming and friendly people and amazing sights and the hotel did not disappoint at all, I  would return there in an instant.","Amazing country, hotel and experience!!!!","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1012818292-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","14","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul_Manchester68","Paul_Manchester68","860ABBE9AF65B027A0C3D93B4AEC61E1",,,,,"Paul_Manchester68"

Das Hotel sieht von aussen durchaus gut aus, wenn man die Kleinigkeiten nicht entdecken will.
Die Fotos sagen schon einiges aus, es wird sich bemüht, die Anlage sauber zu halten.
Ist bei der Menge an Krähen aber fast utopisch. Wie andere auch schon schrieben, kaum saubere intakte Liegen zu finden.
Immer aufpassen wo setzt man sich hin. Sonst ist Kleidung waschen angesagt....

Das Hotel wird wohl von den meisten Reisenden für 1-2 Nächste gebucht, wir waren wohl die Ausnahme mit 6Nächten.
Das bedeutet dann auch keine! Abwechslung beim FrühstücksBüffet!

Wir sind sehr früh gelandet - um 6:30Uhr schon im Hotel angekommen.
Klar da ist noch kein Zimmer fertig.... Es wurde gleich ein EarlyCheckIn angeboten, für schlappe 75USDollar?
Dafür darf man dann sofort auf ein Zimmer - Frühstück gibt es aber dennoch nicht? Das kennen wir auch schon anders.

In meinen Augen ist Management fehl besetzt, die Mitarbeiter sind im Service sehr bemüht, im Rahmen ihrer Möglichkeiten,
aber FrontOffice? pffff
Frage von mir wurde mal gestellt, wo ist die nächste Apotheke? Antwort - 50 Meter die Straße runter...
Ja da hängt ein Apotheken Schild, ein Supermarkt, SimLaden und Apotheke in einem Zimmerchen....
Es wurde aber keine Unterstützung angeboten? Sollen wir etwas besorgen?? Nichts! Und das von 3 Personen mit eher Langeweile hinter dem Counter.
Für 5 Sterne Hotel - da kennen wir anderes...","Eher nicht buchen","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r1008080128-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391071","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg","1200","6","44","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833michaelr","Michael R","4DE1BED2F751127505FDEEAECD6A345C",,"198509","Weiden, Germany","Weiden","833michaelr"

It's the most magnificent area, with plenty of shade, but during our stay they had moved chairs to allow you to at least sit, but we were there to relax after a week of nonstop sightseeing in Sri Lanka, so sitting upright in a chair was not the plan.  That said, our room was wonderful with a fabulous bathroom and stunning sea view.   The hotel is fresh and modern and from the marvellous welcome at Reception on arrival to the friendly efficient staff in the Restaurant we loved this hotel.  We opted for the Half Board deal and were delighted with the extensive buffet breakfast, with live cooking stations for eggs & hoppers and fresh juices etc.  Dinner was Table Service (which we loved) chosen from a Menu to suit all tastes each night, beautifully presented by excellent Servers.  We really enjoyed the Bar for pre-dinner drinks with its relaxed atmosphere, floor to ceiling windows and sofa with footstools seating facing out to sea.

We have been around to many places but the hospitality and kindness of the employees here is truly exceptional. Thisari Navoda and Madhavee Seekhuge were very welcoming and enhanced our experience at Anatara. Sean, who arranges the dinners was great to us. We did our nature walk with Rashmi and she was very passionate about the animals and marine biology surrounding the resort. Shane from Tropic Surf was very helpful to us. There are so many others that I can’t recall the names of, such as the individuals from the Spa, or from the restaurants or from the shops. But everyone was amazing to us.  The private beach is beautiful. The views from the clifftop are breathtaking. Having dinner at the El Mare or just hanging out on the clifftop during the sunset is stunning. The infinity pool is great. The overall design and preservation of nature within the resort is a marvel.  For kids, there is a kids club and a game room. There is also a nature walk where they can see some of the animals in the resort. Overall, it’s spectacular and a must to visit this place.

The common spaces are fantastic with many factory details left in tact.  While the rooms are slightly dated and could benefit from more power outlets, they had to fit hotel rooms into a tea factory.   The views are spectacular and as an added bonus, the grounds are still a working tea plantation.  Most meals are buffet style - we were happy with the selection, though a bit more fresh fruit would have been appreciated.  The staff are kind and helpful.  

The area itself does not have a lot of attractions, so you need to know where you are going and why.  If you like rolling hills, serenity, and tea (emphasis on tea), you will love this place.  If you are looking for action and/or lots of activities, this may not be the place.

Krishna who showed us round the tea factory on the hotel grounds and Mohanraj who was on the front door and we had a lovely chat with. 
I cannot recommend the evening meal enough in the railway carriage which was such a lovely experience. The food was superb. The conductor and chef were  lovely and so friendly and helpful. It is well worth every penny the standard and presentation of the food was incredible. We also enjoyed the buffet one night and the live singing. 
Would highly recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a winding road up to it but well worth it for the views and the temperature is definitely a bit cooler here.","Heritage Tea Factory","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d496624-r1000670764-Heritance_Tea_Factory-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8938EWjuliec","Julie C","CB30F01423A6A6E844934E08677C394D",,,,,"S8938EWjuliec"

The staff were all so proud of their service; polite; extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the history of the Tea Factory.

Turndown service was memorable and the effort to craft an elephant from towels was very special from our floor room boy Jayapraka.

Room and bathroom were very nice (bed was hard). Only complaint - no air con, only a very noisy ceiling fan. I know it's cooler in the mountains, but it was still warm (luckily, the windows opened and there was a cool breeze).

Not only did we get to visit the onsite organic tea factory and fields, but the original engineering is in place, and running, which thrilled my husband!
We had the most magical wedding anniversary, including a gastronomic experience onboard the  TCK6685 classic railway carriage, complete with Conductor, personal Chef and live music, and a surprise cake just for us! The train even moves! Worth every £ for the evening!
A massage and whole body cleanse in the Spa, given by the wonderful Ari, was heaven sent.
The hotel rooms are beautiful,  converted tea factory spaces; extremely opulent and a great two nights sleep.
The Gardener gave us a personal tour of the English garden, which was perfect. There are plenty of hiking, tea picking and other activities on offer.

Our family had been traveling quite a bit, so we were looking to relax and enjoy the amenities offered at the hotel.  From start to finish, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed the tea experience - learning the process of tea-making from picking to processing to tasting.  We also enjoyed High Tea on the terrace one afternoon.  Everything was delicious and there was so much food provided, we didn't need much dinner that evening.  Our favorite experience was the dinner in the train car our first night.  We didn't know what to expect, but the experience was beyond anything we had imagined.  The food, once again, was delicious, and the uniqueness of the traveling train experience was a delight.

The history alone with all the stories of the  factory to read  and machinery to see was very interesting. Room was to a good standard and had heaters etc and the views of the hills with tea plantations and the village near by was a treat to have from our bedroom. Their is a small tea factory tour to take and can pick some tea leaves like a real tea pickers.Food was very tasty and plentiful with a set  menu dinner though first 2 courses were from a buffet.

Starting from the reception, room service, pool, restaurant and even the staff who are not customer facing are so friendly.  Out of all Kanishka in Bojunhala restaurant is the BEST. I need to mention him as he was very kind, supportive and friendly. Keep up the good work and smile always. And to mention the food is very tasty. They had a wide variety of food selection with many action stations. Chef Ladies in the hoppers station are very friendly.

1. die ""Hardware"": das Hotel hat während unseres Aufenthalts gerade seinen 9. Geburtstag gefeiert. Für ein Hotel dieses Alters ist es in einem sehr guten Zustand und wird ständig renoviert und instandgehalten.
Zimmer:
Die Suite ist mit 96m² sehr groß, hat ein tolles Wohn- und Esszimmer, ein Schlafzimmer, Ankleide, und ein Bad mit Badewanne und Dusche. Doch das Beste an der Suite ist der unglaubliche Ausblick vom 3.Stock aus (Level 4) auf den Adults-only-Pool, den tollen Garten und das Meer.- einfach perfekt.
Hotel:
Das Haus hat 2 Flügel mit Zimmern  mit der Lobby in der Mitte. Alles ist elegant und großzügig.
Garten: 
Der Garten (Meerseitig) ist eins der vielen Highlights des Hotetels:
Er ist sehr gepflegt mit einem Adults-only-Pool, dem Lagoon-Pool, einem Kinderpool, einem Wasser-Erlebnis-Bereich, und vielen anderen Aktivitäten. 
Auf der Landseite befindet sich der hauseigene 18-Loch-Golfplatz, traumhaft gepflegt, ein Muß, auch wenn man nicht Golf spielt.
Restaurants:
Buffetrestaurant: Bujunhala:
Das Hauptrestaurant ist recht groß und dadurch nicht ganz gemütlich. Eine Unterteilung mit leichten Stoffen würde hier schon mehr Atmosphäre schaffen. Sehr liebevoll gestalteter Kinderbereich mit eigenem Minis-Buffet.
Hier wird sowohl das Frühstück, was sehr gut ist, als auch das Abendliche Dinner-Buffet serviert. 
Alacarte-Restaurant Sera: gemütliches Restaurant, 
Cocktaillounge Gimanhala: das Gimanhala wurde leider die ersten Tage unseres Aufenthalts umgebaut/renoviert.  Nach Wiedereröffnung durften wir hier den High-Tea geniessen.
Golfclub und Bar Ulpatha:
Ein echtes ""Schmankerl"": direkt am Golfplatz genießt man hier einen Cocktail bei Sonnenuntergang, aber auch tolle moderne Küche. Gegen 16:00 schaut dann auch der ein oder andere Pfau auf der Terrasse vorbei und geht mit den Gästen auf Tuchfühlung.

2. Die ""Software"":
Uns ist wieder die  Freundlichkeit und der Professionalität aller Mitarbeiter aufgefallen.
Herausragend war Navindu im Restaurant Bojunhala, der -trotz teilweise viel Trubel- immer freundlichst und aufmerksam war, wie wir es sonst nur in der Spitzengastronomie gewohnt  sind.
Auch der Koch Dilan hat uns sehr mit seiner tollen Küche verwöhnt.
Im Ulpatha wurden wir speziell vom dortigen Teamleiter mit aussergewöhnlichem Service umsorgt. 
Danke an dieser Stelle, auch an das gesamte Team.","Urlaub im Paradies","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1027209-d8869502-r1012405192-Shangri_La_Hambantota-Hambantota_Tangalle_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip13392635386","DayTrip13392635386","164EEE44C2D858284365E171A04DD3DD",,,,,"DayTrip13392635386"

Thank you for your detailed feedback. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment experienced during your stay.

We deeply regret the issues with pool access, vegetarian food options, allergen labeling, and responsiveness from our team. Your concerns are valid, and we have already taken corrective action—including improving vegetarian offerings, clearer food labeling, better communication, and addressing maintenance and service delays.

We truly value your input and are committed to making immediate improvements. Should you give us another opportunity, we would be honored to provide you with the level of hospitality you rightfully expect from Shangri-La.

But only fakes them selves as 5 star. 
1. At check in we found out that main pool was close for the maintenance. We requested them to Atleast give us usage at adult pool , that also they said no, they tell use the baby pool for famiily , which was only 2.5 feet depth. We even requested room upgrade for which they told me it will take 2 more hours to ready those rooms. Which 5 star property does this. I have been to Mariott Welagama and Taj Bentota both were amazing but this Shangrila Hambantota is worthless in customer experience. 
2. Food I suggest only book if u are NON VEGETARIAN EATER. The. Buffet have very limited choise for vegetarian and Indian vegetarian there were only 3 items on menu. . 75% items are non vegetarian . Trust me guys Indian vegetarian will die with hunger here , Jain people please avoid this place the whole area smells of meat and fish products. No proper exhaust. Vegetarian specially jain this hotel is strict no no . The chef was pre informed about our dietary requirement . But we got 1 extra paneer vegetable for all that effort. The chef did favour on us by making that also. We requested to Atleast give one vegetarian pizza because we had no option on buffet to eat, but they said the pizza is not on buffet and chargeable. What type of hospitality is this . The manager should understand that they already have limited option and not able to eat and inspite of supporting they asked for money. Disgusting hospitality and the manger is worthless being a five star. . 
3. Morning breakfast had 3 veg items . Only inspire of head chef knowing there are vegetarian guest also after all discussion following dinner in the night. , still they could not bake us 1 or 2 eggless pastries. After some talk chef managed to do a favour again by bringing some from kitchen. These guys provide but first they spoil the mood by saying not there and than do us favour by providing little . They make channa masala and when u asked what to eat with , they told me with thick dosa. Is he really a chef or what . Who eats channa masala with dosa . They could have baked some puris with channa masala . Senseless and weird. Just hiding their inability to cater properly. 
4. No proper tagging of allergies on food items . Things that contain eggs are just named and no sign of any allergiens in food being a 5 star is shocking . Did they hire head chef someone from 3 star hotel . Some items have eggs and it’s mentioned other have eggs and still not mentioned . Is it some sort of joke. 
5. WiFi sucks . Rooms air conditioning sucks . Property is under lots of maintenance . 
6. Duty managers are sleeping and unresponsive. They keep u wait for 15- 20 min to meet with them. Like they have paid us money to come here and attend them. 
INSHORT ITS A PARADISE FOR NON VEGETARIAN EATERS. Vegetarian should refrain from booking. You pay so much in name if 5 star property and they have such low standard for customer satisfaction 

Shangrila Team please mention on website that u can’t provide and cater to vegetarian. Buffet should have Atleast 50% veg on menu. Including pastries also. Go green and start serving vegan and vegetarian. Just saving papers and washing powders won’t make u green.","POOR VARIETIES OF VEGETARIAN FOOD.

Throughout our stay, every member of your staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. The F&B team at your restaurant delighted us each day with an impressive variety of delicious dishes—every meal was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.

Our room was immaculately maintained, with all facilities in perfect working order. The housekeeping staff paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring our space was always pristine and inviting. Equally noteworthy was the spotless condition of the entire resort: the sparkling pool areas, lush gardens, and common areas all reflected your commitment to cleanliness and excellence.

We would also like to extend our gratitude to the management team for regularly checking in on us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Your proactive approach and genuine interest in our comfort did not go unnoticed and made us feel truly valued as guests.

Today is our last day, so I thought I would write a review. From when we arrived to the whole time here, it's been amazing. The staff go above and beyond for you. The housekeeping team is excellent, making you feel very at home. Our room was spotlessly clean every day. The gardens are perfectly done and kept to a high standard. The pools are clean, and at this time, it's very quiet, so no rushing for a sunbed in the morning. The buffet gives a wide choice of food, and we love the themed nights. For myself, the Asian let itself down. It was cold food, and the food was not restocked or freshly cooked. We did go the 8.30 sitting, and it just felt they hadn't recovered from the previous sitting, which was a shame. But overall, this hotel is perfect and would highly recommend it. Also, I would recommend going around to see the island and experience the Sri Lankan culture.

I’d like to especially highlight the incredible hospitality of three individuals who have truly made this holiday unforgettable.

Harsha, the sous chef, has been a standout from day one. Every day, he’s taken the time to walk me through the local ingredients and flavours, sharing his deep knowledge and passion for Sri Lankan cuisine. When traditional Sri Lankan curries haven’t been on the buffet, he’s gone out of his way to prepare something special just for me—each dish full of bold, authentic flavours that you simply can’t find outside of Sri Lanka. His food has been a genuine highlight of the trip, and I only wish he’d open his own Sri Lankan restaurant in London—I’d be first in line. Harsha’s talent, warmth, and dedication to his craft have made my dining experience here unforgettable.

Marshall has been a fantastic host at every mealtime, always welcoming us with a smile and taking a genuine interest in our family. He’s also been kind enough to educate me on cricket and the IPL—so much so that I’ll be following the Mumbai Indians from now on!

Malinda, the head waiter, has been the epitome of professionalism—always attentive, friendly, and consistently delivering a high standard of service.

Alongside the brilliant kids’ club team, these three individuals have helped make this a holiday we’ll cherish for years to come.

මම දැන් ශ්‍රි ලංකාවේ රිඋ හෝටලයේ සිටින අතර මෙහි සේවය විශිෂ්ටයෙන් ඉහළය. මේ නිවාඩුව අමතක නොවන අයුරින් හැඳිනවමින් සිටිපු විශේෂ පුද්ගලයින් තුන්දෙනෙකුගේ සන්සුන් සහ ආදරණීය සේවාව ගැන විශේෂයෙන් අවධානය යොමු කරන්න කැමතියි.

මාර්ෂල් සෑම ආහාර වේලාවකදීම අපව හිනැහෙමින් පිළිගනිමින්, අපේ පවුල පිළිබඳ සැලකිල්ලක් දක්වමින් ඉතාමත් ආදරණීය ලෙස හැසිරුණා. ඔහු මට ක්‍රිකට් සහ IPL ගැන දැනුමක් ලබා දුන්නා—දැන් ඉදිරියට මම මැම්බායි ඉන්ඩියන්ස් (Mumbai Indians) කණ්ඩායමටම අනුග්‍රහය දක්වනවා!

මාලිඳ, ප්‍රධාන 웨ටරයෙක් වශයෙන්, ඉතාමත් වෘත්තීයමය ලෙස, හැමවිටම අවධානයෙන් හා උණුසුමෙන් සේවය කළා.

මෙම තුන්දෙනා සහ ළමයින්ගේ ක්ලබ් කාර්ය මණ්ඩලය සමඟ, මේ නිවාඩුව අපේ ජීවිතයේ දිගුකාලික මතකයක් බවට පත්වී ඇත.","10/10","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1010947205-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","4","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157jamesi","James I","78B7E2989F6128F3BCEBDCBCF1F19F4C",,"503869","Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom","Hemel Hempstead","157jamesi"

vielen Dank, dass Sie uns gewählt haben und für Ihre Bewertung. 

Da uns ein hoher Servicestandard sehr am Herzen liegt, tut es uns schrecklich leid über Ihre Erfahrung zu lesen und es ist Ihr gutes Recht, dies hier auszudrücken. Danke für die offenen Worte! Wir werden im kommenden Meeting aufarbeiten, was wir alles Ihrer Meinung nach nicht gut gemacht haben und daraus lernen. Versprochen! Sehr gerne hätten wir uns gewünscht, dass Sie eine bessere Erfahrung gemacht hätten und wir werden uns weiterhin um Qualität bemühen. 

Wir hoffen, dass Sie uns in der Zukunft eine weitere Gelegenheit geben werden, damit wir beim nächsten Mal Ihre Erwartungen erfüllen dürfen.

Naja Blonde Kinder wie in unserem Fall aus Deutschland werden gerne ohne zu fragen Fotografiert und von dem Personal und den Besuchern betatscht. 
Man gewöhnt sich daran auch wenn es nervt.

Das Essen war gut aber jetzt nicht überragend. 

Was überhaupt nicht geht sind folgende Dinge: 

20€ Aufschlag für eine Stunde längeres nutzen des Hotelzimmers, dies wurde anderen deutschen in der letzten Woche berechnet.

Einheimische werden super behandelt was ok ist aber die leute führen sich noch schlimmer auf als manche Russen, es werden becher im Pool rumgeworfen und ausgespült, das Personal sieht es sagt aber nichts.
Es wird an den Wochenenden extra alles schön für die Einheimischen hergerichtet und am Montag dann wieder abgebaut.

Zimmerservice war wirklich gut.

Hotel hat dringende Renovierung nötig, egal ob die falschen Fliesen verlegt wurden (extreme Rutschgefahr) Fassaden Schäden, Stromausfälle oder sonstiges. 

Wir werden beim nächsten Urlaub wieder nach Hikkaduwa gehen.

We left our windows open at night to listen to the ocean. The pool is beautiful and not crowded although the weather was hot. Buffet meals with Sri Lankan dishes on one side and western dishes on the other. Very tasty curries. We had a boat trip on the Madu River to see 64 small islands, including cinnamon island where we learned more about the growing and harvesting of cinnamon. The highlight of this trip was sailing through the mangrove caves. I just repeat that in Sri Lanka they definitely train their hotel staff well, all very friendly and efficient.

We decided to take a chance, hoping for nice, less UV intensive weather and low-touristic moment of the year. We specifically choose this hotel because we are loyal fans of the Riu brand. From the moment we arrived, it exceeded our expectations. Despite the season, the weather was wonderful. Occasional rain showers, and cloudy skies were actually a very welcome refreshment. The service was impeccable. Every staff member was professional, warm and genuinely friendly. We felt really taken care of. The hotel itself is stunning and caters beautifully to both: families and adults only. There is one big common pool, one sporty pool, one adults only and one, slammer for kids only. The food was delicious, especially the Asian  cuisine. Each dish was full of flavour. Cleanliness was another strong point, bot in the common areas and in the rooms. The spa was also easily accessible, with plenty of staff available - no need to wait long for the treatments. Right outside the hotel, there was a convenient Tuk-Tuk / taxi stand, making it easy and affordable to travel to nearby attractions and shopping. The hotel has two shops, one more affordable with all kinds of souvenirs and clothes. 
Whether you are travelling alone, with the kids or adults only mode - the hotel will offer a variety of solutions to spend your time.
We are already thinking about coming back! It is a perfect destination for a two weeks holidays, and we wholeheartedly recommend.","Rain or Shine - Riu Delivers","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1010291919-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389949","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlicjaB96","Alicja B","5E55B1BE8088F2DE008B4A940E5CD4AD",,,,,"AlicjaB96"

The hotel was really nice, the food was delicious, and the staff were incredibly polite – just as I had read in all the reviews prior to my trip. I have to agree, it was all true!

I particularly want to praise the room service. The room was always clean and tidy, and the daily towel art was fantastic! Each day, after breakfast, we were greeted by different towel creatures like crocodile, penguin or a rhino! These amazing creations added a special touch to my stay. It was the room boy Supun, under the supervision of Kaushal, who could create all these - I am adding some pics below. Amazing, right?

Another person who made our stay memorable is Githmi. Githmi is the girl who greeted us at the door to the restaurant before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She always had a pleasant smile on her face, was very nice, and very polite. Githmi's warm welcome made us enjoy the delicious food even more!

Thank you, Riu Sri Lanka, for making our visit memorable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a delightful and unique experience.","Relaxing stay with impressive service","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1010140234-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenkag544","Lenka G","F83F2BE378A33FA9F03F00BBD9F0E5AC",,,,,"lenkag544"

Hotel was super quiet as it's low season, which suited us great , plenty of sunbeds to choose from, and on a couple of days had the whole pool to ourselves.
It does get a lot busier at the weekend with the locals visiting 

As lots of people have already said the sea is rough especially this time of the year , with red flags all the time so if your looking for sea swimming maybe this isn't the place for you at this time of the year. 

Weather was super hot around 30 degrees each day but expect some rain and storms and it to be overcast most days as it is the start of monsoon season 
We experienced the best storm I have ever seen, 

The hotel and grounds are kept immaculate  ,with plentiful wildlife 
We saw large snails ,chipmunks, lizards and even monkeys in the trees at the front of the hotel 
the staff from the Front desk to the housekerping team were some of the friendliest people I have even met in all my years of travelling, nothing was too much trouble. 

The superior sea room i would say has the best views as you can see the entire grounds as well as the front row sea view 

If you are looking for evening shows, we never saw one as a couple of times we went to the show area for 9pm , there was only a few people, so I think the shows got cancelled 
They did have singers in the lobby area 

Food is very tasty. However, buffet does do the same sort of food each night 

The only negative I will add coming at this time of year and im unsure if this is just a seasonal or year round thing is the al carte  restaurants,  2 are only open 1 time per week and the steak resturant open twice , and although they advertise beef tenderloin steak they only had beef strip steak 

Very limited choice on cocktails and if you are used to staying in other rius in the carribbean as we are they don't seem to offer any of the creamy style cocktails or branded alcohol,  wasn't to much of a problem just had to stick with wine 

The tuk tuk drivers on the front of the hotel  are ok just negotiate a price when telling them where you want to go, 

If you prefer to eat outside of the hotel get a tuk tuk to aluthgama to the pier 88 resturant you won't be disappointed,  just be careful if the tuk tuk driver waits, he may want to join you at your table as this happened to us  twice,  just politely say would you mind leaving 
And they will sit outside 

Also the tuk tuk drivers on the beach might take you to places you have not asked to go like a temple or turtle sanctuary / jewellers  seems they must get some sort of back hand for taking people to spend there money we asked to be taken to 1 place which should have taken half hour and didn't get to our actual destination for 2 hours with all the unscheduled pitstops . 

I would definitely return to this hotel

We have shared feedback with the responsible department for an appropriate follow up as we hope to see you again in one of our worldwide hotels in the future!

Chose these properties . 
Request all Indian and vegetarian guest please don’t take this hotel . You will die of hunger. We had only one option of brown bread and dosa in whole buffet to eat . Eggs in everything . They don’t know to bake without eggs.  Mariott and taj are much better in providing meals .

While it has been a pleasant experience, this hotel is more commercialised compared to the others we stayed in. The room was very clean with stunning sea views, but sadly lacking in a hairdryer that we had to ask for and wait 15 minutes while it was delivered. The pool area is good and the swim up bar is a very nice touch. The buffet at breakfast and dinner has a fantastic choice, but sadly the hot dishes were not very hot and a bit of a disappointment. Compared to our other hotels the service in the restaurant was average at best. When checking out 2 of the lads at the desk asked for a mention in our review. Sorry but from my point of view, all you really did was take my money for drinks and a meal and I didn’t receive any service from you. Would I praise every checkout assistant whenever I went shopping at the supermarket, I think not.","A nice place to stay","2025-04","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r1002316287-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","3","19","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darren2300","Darren","F1F74938C28B42E87FD6F10A72FC4FED",,,,,"Darren2300"

Rooms did indeed have an excellent sea view , so for once that promise did live up to the hype.  Rooms are good, if a little shabbily finished around the edges in bathroom/shower.   Air con works well, good shower. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (we did arrive early), but they had changing rooms to allow us to sit by pool, we spent most of the day in the garden / pool area for the afternoon, very pleasant. Pool has a small swim-up bar. Towels provided.  It didn’t bother us but there were a lot of crows round, I guess if you were there for a few days their call may get on your nerves after a while. Went for a walk on the beach. Great beach, but beach is pretty littered which is a shame. We asked for a-la-carte for dinner, but somehow in communication issues they ended up giving us the buffet which I guess they push as its easier for them. So if you don’t want the buffet, make sure you are understood.  It was pretty good but was a lot of food! Wine is expensive. Staff need to sell amenities a bit more, I didn’t know there was a gym (no-one mentioned it) until we left and we only found the roof-top bar by mistake!   But all in all, a perfect stop for one night at start of tour.","Fine hotel relatively near airport to start tour of Sri Lanka.

Wir haben die 2 Tage sehr genossen, vor allem das reichhaltige Frühstücksbuffet, alle sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Shan verbreitet grundsätzlich gute Laune in der Lobby und ist sehr hilfsbereit, wie auch der Rest der Angestellten.
Keine 100m Fußweg entfernt befindet sich ein sehr gutes italienisches Restaurante, dass nach dem scharfen Essen der letzten 2 Wochen eine Wohltat für den Gaumen war.
Wir würden dieses Hotel definitiv jedem Empfehlen.
Minimaler Minuspunkt: Um eine Liege zu ergattern, muss man um 10 auf der Liegewiese stehen oder typisch deutsch um 8 reservieren.

Beautiful view out over the pool and lake. Lovely balcony, where you could hear the sounds of nature around. Very tranquil. Friendly and attentive lovely staff, very helpful. We were greeted with a refreshing towel and drink on arrival, check in was easy and we were helped with our bags. It’s a beautiful hotel in lovely natural surroundings. Our bathroom and room was lovely. They gave us a little cake for our honeymoon and a honeymoon message on the bed. They helped surprise my husband with a birthday cake with his name on it. The pool was clean and the perfect temperature. Highly recommend this hotel. I got a foot massage in the spa which was very relaxing. There is lots of options for the food and it is to a very high standard. We visited Minneriya national park and Sigiriya rock while staying here.

The hotel is a lovely oasis just outside of Dambulla.  We had a ground floor room with access to the pool which suited us perfectly.  The room itself was large with a huge bathroom containing both a bath and a walk in shower.  Bed & pillows were both really comfortable.

We were out each morning but returned in the afternoon and made use of the sunbeds and pool which were always quiet (no blaring music & no fight for a bed!) & had beautiful views of the lake. 

Breakfast is buffet style with lots of choice & well prepared.  We stayed on a B&B basis but ate in the buffet restaurant each evening as the choice & quality was so good.  I don't think there was anywhere within walking distance that would have been an option.

The gym is small but well equipped.  

All of the staff were friendly and attentive.  We noted that this hotel has a few trainee managers that seemed to go the extra mile to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay, in particular was Ishodha (not sure about the spelling!) who was especially attentive.  Good luck to him, he has the makings of a fine hotel manager!

We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish, quality stay in this part of Sri Lanka.","Where style, comfort and quality collide","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r1000677427-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,,,,,"5","62","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aroundincircles100","Aroundincircles100","54A0C60D88A5CD97F427F4F05CE14D28",,"186254","Exeter, United Kingdom","Exeter","Aroundincircles100"

Modernist style, beautifully appointed room & grounds. The staff are genuinely helpful & friendly. 

The buffet & room service are great.

We were lucky to get a top floor room in the building not overlooking the pool, in the wing looking to the lake & trees, so were entertained by the monkeys visiting our balcony, along with the squirrels & birds. We could easily see birds including fish eagles & kites. Most of the monkeys run away except a couple of them, so don’t leave food or clothes on the balcony… we were amused that a male knew where to look for food through the window.

There are birdwatching & other tours which we didn’t have time for but wish we had done.

The pool is 70 metres long, & warm, with a bar near it. The gym is very good. 

A ride to Dambulla town is about 15 minutes.

If I had to comment on a negative… the light switches are in very strange places!

The hotel room was lovely overlooking the lake in the garden block. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with a great shower and bath with a view. It was lovely sitting out early evening watching the monkeys playing in the trees,listening to the peacocks and many different birds. I could have stayed there forever with the view. 
The buffet restaurant had lots of choice for both breakfast and evening meal. Lovely to sit outside for both and listen to the wildlife. Loved the different closed areas for starters and dessert which prevents birds flying in to steal the food.
We found the hotel to be both clean and comfortable and staff welcoming and pleasant. 
I would definitely recommend and sadly not enough time to spend enjoying the facilities due to a tight schedule of our tour however we did make use of the wonderful swimming pool which had a lovely view of the grounds.
Unsure if there is any entertainment in the evening as we were shattered and retired early to get ready for another adventure the following day.

It has very comfortable, large open rooms. The staff are one of its greatest features. Whilst I was there all of the staff were most friendly and went out of their way to be helpful after the first day I was greeted by name by staff who came to me to ask if all was well and could they assist. Morning breakfasts were a joy as the staff remembered my preferences . Samantha and Dumith are only two of the names of the wonderful staff who made my stay so perfect.
The restaurants are all excellent, in particular my favourite was Lagoon with its stunning display seafood, all of which could be cooked in multiple ways. 

I had a problem changing the details of my booking. I was booked via keytravel for 4 nights but wanted to break this into 3 + 1 with a night away in the middle to visit Kandy. You would think this would be a simple change. Keytravel were useless and couldn't do it. Cinnamon Head Office stonewalled it with stupid comments about their policy for third-party bookings. As a head office, they were totally customer-unfriendly and stupidly tied to a nonsensical policy. As a senior academic in hospitality and tourism for 41 years I have never come across such stupidity. They would fail any of my classes on customer care.
I was appalled at the lack of customer orientation and care by Keytravel and Cinnamon Head Office.
 It was only when I contacted the hotel sales department directly that Shaun Windsor very professionally took ownership and instantly resolved the nonsensical problem. 
I should not have needed to jump through hoops for such a simple request; keytravel and Cinnamon Head Office should hang their heads in shame.","Wonderful hotel, amazingly helpful staff, Excellent restaruants.

Hotel is the new, everything works great, rooms are clean and modern-styled. I took the room with half-sea/half-city view and the view was wonderful!
The quality of service is at the highest level. Nice and clean pool on the rooftop.
Breakfast, lunch and Dinner was not included in the price. I went for a dinner to the buffet: the food was fresh and tasty. I ordered some drinks: they were also delicious. Price reasonable: tea + fresh + dinner about 5k 🤩 Staff member Ajith was very kind and attentive. There was living music! The musician was very professional and created a wonderful atmosphere for the dinner.

The team really made this holiday, Gehan from the animation team was the best and had the best interaction with all the guests.

We had 14 full days here (still here now) and every day was just perfect. No problems whatsoever from the most amazing team who work SO hard. 

Room (3030) excellent, the views over the beach and sea made morning and sunsets even better… ask for this room when staying here.

Team- THE BEST! We have stayed in plenty of Riu Places but this is the best service and standards we have ever had. 

Drinks- Definitely room for improvement but Lion Beer was fresh and good quality. Wine different in every restaurant but good quality. 

Only downside to the whole holiday was the hotel are trialing the locals to attend over the weekend in the low season which is an amazing idea and well deserved but they are so rude towards the team and guests. We were pushed out of the way at food, eating with their heads from the buffet, the wife gestured too and a fight at reception. The team couldn’t do enough to rectify the situations but it’s one to be aware of over the weekends at this hotel.

We did (are) having the best time and would recommend to anyone despite the few minor issues.","Hotel Sri Lanka… Honest Review","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d10039170-r1008933882-Hotel_Riu_Sri_Lanka-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandermZ7194VN","Alexander M","369D54DC9963B4292814941801661D88",,,,,"alexandermZ7194VN"

- show drain festers a foul smell

- Food is choice poor and served lukewarm. Would fail any food inspection. Left me with an upset stomach for most of my stay, and my journey home extremely was uncomfortable due to this. 

- Staff are very attentive 

- Management do not trust workers heard from the manger and reps within the hotel to make sure smart devices and valuables are locked away.

- The cleaning head also asks for reviews on how the cleaning staff did daily. Cleaning is done a strange hours, and the constant check ups became annoying.
 
- putting your belongings through airport type security screenings on arrival and every time you re enter the hotel- if you plan on doing excursions please be aware of that. 

- difficult to regulate the temperature in the room.

- Room was not ready on arrival after travelling for over 28 hours being made to wait another 3 hours to gain access into the room 

- Late noise disturbances late into the evening 

- temperature of water in shower changes rapidly and i got scolded by the temperature of the water 

- Hotel entertainment is poor, the have the same acts rotating so if you’re spending more than week here you will pretty familiar with the schedule.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay at Shangri-La Hambantota. We are truly pleased to hear that you enjoyed our beautiful property, beach access, and the culinary experience — especially the personalized attention provided by Chef Dharmendra Shah. Your kind words will certainly be shared with him and the culinary team; he’ll be delighted to know he made a positive impact on your stay.

That said, we are sincerely sorry for the inconveniences you experienced with housekeeping and the air conditioning in your room. It is disappointing to hear that these issues affected your comfort, and we fully understand how unsettling that must have been.

We are pleased to note that our Rooms Division Manager had the opportunity to speak with you personally at the time of your departure regarding these concerns. Following your report, our engineering team did attend to the air conditioning, and we hope it was brought back to a satisfactory level during your stay.

With regard to the pest issue, please accept our sincerest apologies. While regular pest control is indeed carried out across the resort, it is likely that recent fumigation activities in nearby room blocks may have caused cockroaches to appear temporarily in your room. We understand how distressing this must have been. Our housekeeping team has since conducted a thorough deep cleaning of the room in your presence, and we have taken immediate corrective action to prevent any recurrence.

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, and we assure you that maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness, comfort, and guest satisfaction remains our top priority.

We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future, and provide a seamless experience that reflects the true standards of Shangri-La hospitality.
Till we meet again please take care.

We had our dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We are vegetarian so were not sure if we would enjoy the buffet dinner.

Chef Balbeer, made us feel at home, clearly explaining all the different vegetarian dishes. Once he realised, we don't eat eggs, he said no worries and prepared rotis which we thoroughly enjoyed along with very tasty curries. Chef Balbeer went out of his way to prepare perfect potato bhajias, which my wife and I enjoyed.

The whole of the restaurant team provided service with a smile and would like to mention Ganesh for his exemplary service.

The answer is a definite no!! It should be half the going rate as it is quite tired, service is okay with a downside if everyone looking for a tip.

Food is rather average so lower your expectation. With only 50 rooms they cannot put on a big spread so menu is a little limiting.

Added activities such as tea leaf picking and the factory tour or the tea processing is a nice touch. You blink then it’s over!! Now what do you do??

Firstly the highs . The wonderful staff . They are amazing and the restaurant food is superb . The girls in the spa are lovely and Mohan who took us on a 2 hour walk through the tea plantation was knowledgeable and kind . 
Sadly that’s it . The hotel is tired . The rooms  are dated . Nothing looks like it has been refreshed since the hotel opened . With the most outstanding setting there are no deckchairs . Anything soft to sit on would have been appreciated. 
Maybe they think people come for one night and move on , but this is a place to stay for a couple of nights for rest .

We were greeted with a lovely gesture, and it was clear that a lot of effort had gone into making us feel welcome.

The rooms were very comfortable and had all the facilities we needed. Although the beach was a bit rough, we still enjoyed it. The pool was very relaxing and had ample space to swim around and chill.

Thisari was our host, and she was extremely helpful and clear with all her instructions. She was always reachable and assisted us in booking the nature walk and the canoe ride—which, to be honest, we might have skipped if she hadn’t convinced us. And what a great decision that turned out to be!

Suresh at the restaurant was also very helpful, friendly, and witty. He made sure we were having a good time and regularly checked if we needed anything. He even took our photos without any hesitation, which we really appreciated.

The nature walk was a lovely experience. Even though we are locals, it’s definitely a must-do—it gives you a fresh perspective on the surroundings and is also very informative. Konara, our guide, was punctual, friendly, and clearly passionate about what he does. Although he knew we were locals, he still made the walk engaging and interesting.

Overall, I would give a 10 out of 10 for the location, the people, the service, and the memories.","Was a wonderful experience. The location, cleanliness, people and the service was 10/10.

We stayed at six hotels over nine days in Sri Lanka and experienced the warm hospitality the country is known for, but the staff at Anantara were exceptionally generous with their time—and their sincerity felt truly genuine. 

From the moment we arrived, we received a warm ceremonial welcome. The check-in process and tour of the grounds were handled with elegance, and our room was clean with a lovely view. 

A special shoutout to Ms. Thisari, who made our stay truly memorable. She was not only helpful but also thoughtful with every arrangement, going the extra mile to ensure we were comfortable throughout.

Suresh, one of the staff at Journey Restaurant, was also a delight. He greeted us with the biggest smile each morning at breakfast and was always attentive to our needs. During one of our dinners, another member of the waitstaff (I’m so sorry I didn’t catch your name!) noticed my husband sneezing and offered to brew us a pot of black tea with ginger and honey. The tea was delicious, but what touched us most was the attentiveness and sincerity behind the gesture.

One afternoon, while enjoying in-room dining in our garden, a beautiful peacock came and stayed with us until we finished our meal. It was one of the most magical moments of our trip.

Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle exceeded all our expectations and gave us the perfect ending to our Sri Lankan adventure. Highly recommended!

After visiting the south west and south of the island, this time we decided to have a bit of convenience of the airport-proximity and stayed at Heritance Negombo for six nights in four rooms for the group. 

The hotel is perfectly located at the Negombo beach with nice surroundings and easy beach access. The lawns are very well kept. All rooms are sea facing and spacious enough. 

That’s where I run out of the positives for this place unfortunately. Comparatively, this was our worst Sri Lankan hospitality experience. Kindly let me begin:
- despite booking months in advance with requests to allocate rooms together (as travelling with 80+ old parents), albeit in the same wing, we were given rooms apart. The duty manager gave us sloppy excuses when challenged. The other request regarding birthday of a group member was completely ignored.
- one room wasn’t ready at checkin despite we arriving at 5pm. The cleaning was down in a haste with room full of mosquitoes when handed over to us. 
- the restaurant was shambles to begin with. On day one, over dinner, we were completely ignored over the other Caucasian guests with order not arriving for well over an hour. While we thought that this was an exception, unfortunately the trend was to be seen everywhere. 
- Most guests use this as one or two night stay at the start or the end of their tour. Having booked it for a long stay, we were astonished to see that breakfast spread was exactly the same every day which was a haphazard array of assortments with poor quality. Offerings at other similarly priced hotels in SL is far superior. 
- The staff lacked attention to detail and hardly acted to customers’ requirements. On regular occasions, meal (or general) requests were lost, miscommunicated or mismanaged. It reflected lack of proper training even at supervisory level. 
- My parents were left locked out of their room at 11pm for more than 30minutes due to low battery reflecting poor housekeeping but it was not that what irked us but the behaviour of a staff member who questioned us if we were valid guests for the room despite three time card renewal by the reception. 
- The restaurant menu lacked variety especially if you have dietary restrictions. My parents who were vegetarians just had couple of items on the whole a-la-carte menu to order from (imagine this is Sri Lanka which has abundance of vegetables and fruits). Even the SriLankan menu was sparse. There were no coconuts (even at outdoor bar despite being on the menu) or bananas (at breakfast) to be found during our long stay with excuses galore (again don’t forget this is land of bananas and coconuts but this place either finds Sri Lankan authenticity too demeaning or a nuisance to be bothered with). The cafe and Italian across the road, which was part of the hotel, again had very limited menu which meant that they hardly had any punters despite being at prime location and wonderful setting. 

On the whole, it was an underwhelming experience to say the least. It seemed that the management is trying hard to cater to western clients forgetting the fact the clientele are there to have an essential Sri Lankan experience.  The food offering is poorly thought through. And it might sound controversial but perhaps, they don’t want coloured guests, so I would avoid this place if you are not white as the experience reminded us of a colonial mindset (I know I’m saying this in 2025 but that’s how we felt).","A big disappointment!","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d8073048-r998766173-Sentido_Heritance_Negombo-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","66","153","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Excaliburr","Excaliburr","12786A0DEF447BD767C3C189C3A1D82C",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","Excaliburr"

Thank you for your review following your recent visit.

We regret to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations and would like to address your concerns.

Kindly note that we have conducted a detailed internal review, including checking CCTV footage and staff records. Our findings indicate the following

•	Check-in Experience: Contrary to your statement, no guests were seen cutting the line or being prioritized. Your check-in process took 12 minutes, and the delay was solely due to a missing identification document from your group, which was later resolved with a digital passport copy.
•	Recheck-in and room availability: At no point were you informed that the hotel was fully occupied. Your rebooking was successfully made via our online platform at 09:00 hrs, and our team began assisting you upon your arrival at 10:00 hrs. CCTV footage confirms a 17-minute recheck-in process with no other guests at the counter during that time. However, we acknowledge that the process may not have felt as seamless as expected, and we regret any frustration this may have caused. 
•	Room cleaning: We regret if our housekeeping interaction felt unprofessional and will follow up with the relevant team to ensure improved communication going forward.  
•	Food delivery: Please note that, as an operational procedure, we do not handle outside food deliveries due to health and safety reasons. Guests are required to collect such orders from the entrance. We apologize if this caused any inconvenience.

At Cinnamon Red, we take every concern seriously, but we also stand by our team when the facts and documentation do not support the allegations made. It is disheartening to see a review written with such harshness, particularly when many of the claims are not substantiated.

Nonetheless, your feedback has been noted and shared with senior management.

Rude service. ","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","1","Sleep Quality","5","I’m honestly furious with how badly this hotel has gone downhill. I used to rate it 5 stars. I used to recommend it to friends and family. But after this recent stay, I’ll never come back — and I hope management takes this seriously because things are falling apart fast.

To the management:
You desperately need to retrain your staff. Whatever standards you once had are clearly gone. Hospitality isn’t just about rooms — it’s about respect, service, and care. Right now, none of that exists here.

Let me break down the four situations that made my stay a complete nightmare:

1. Check-in was a disaster.
It was slow, disorganized, and beyond frustrating. I waited for ages while others cut the line with the staff just ignoring it. It set the tone for what turned out to be an awful stay.

2. Lied to about room availability.
I asked to extend my stay — they told me the hotel was full. Turns out, that was a lie. I checked online right there and booked a room from their own site. When I showed this, they gave me the runaround, wasting my time and acting like they were doing me a favor. Unbelievable.

3. Rude and unprofessional housekeeping.
When I requested cleaning the next morning, the cleaner showed up and started interrogating me about when I checked in and why the room needed cleaning again. Then he blamed the reception team like it was my fault. I’m here to rest, not get caught in your internal mess.

4. Food delivery drama.
I ordered food via Uber Eats, and the driver brought it to the entrance. I asked the staff to collect it from reception — totally normal, right? Nope. The outside crew refused to even let the driver park. One staff member, Manohara, insisted the driver just wait until I came downstairs. Even after I made it crystal clear to just take the delivery, the way they treated the driver — and me — was downright rude and dismissive.

I’m angry. I’m disappointed. I’m done with this place.
This hotel used to feel welcoming — now it just feels like a joke. If anyone in management actually cares, fix this. Fast.","Getting Worst","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d6912248-r1006682243-Cinnamon_Red_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"50","303821508","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/1b/f2/c4/sasanka-w.jpg","50","1","16","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669sasankaw","sasanka w","686894AD618F2CBBEB737348F5F90BC1",,,,,"669sasankaw"

The hotel is set a little away from the main road and offers a peaceful retreat.  The staff are helpful and always have a smile on their face.  
Our room was luxurious with a great view of the lake, garden and pool.  Although we didn’t use the pool, it looked very inviting.
There are indoor and outdoor bars and a large open restaurant adjacent to and opening onto the garden.  There is an A La Carte or buffet option: both offering delicious food and a variety of options.
This is a hotel where large tour groups may use, but the space is plentiful.  We found this not to be off-putting.

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Jetwing Lake! We're thrilled to hear that you had such a fantastic stay, from the warm and welcoming greeting to the stunning room upgrade. It's always great to know that the little touches, like the politeness of the staff and the gorgeous view from your balcony, helped make your time even more special.

We're also glad you enjoyed the food, especially the Sri Lankan dishes and the Egg Hoppers! The atmosphere with the fire torches really adds to the experience, and it's great to know that both your dining experiences and the excursions, like the visit to Sigiriya Rock and the safari at Minneriya National Park, were memorable.

Your comments on the cleanliness, eco-friendly initiatives, and the professionalism of the staff truly reflect the essence of what Jetwing Lake aims to provide. We’re so happy you had the chance to appreciate both the service and the sustainable practices. We hope you’ll return to one of the Jetwing hotels for more amazing experiences, and we’re delighted that you had such a great time overall.

Thank you again for the thoughtful review, and we wish you many more unforgettable adventures!

Ayubowan! (May you live a long life!)

On arrival we had the politest greeting with drinks & snacks, received a tour of the hotel and was shown to our room - a complimentary upgrade to the super deluxe.  When the young lady asked if it was ok to come into the room and then took her shoes off, we knew we were on holiday and we knew this hotel, and Sri Lanka in general, was going to be epic. 

After getting our head around the size of the room, the gorgeous view from our balcony over the pool & lake, the huge bathroom and the secret cupboard (I'll leave that as a surprise) we headed for a wander around the lake and to the bar for a celebratory drink where we were met with the same high level of service from the bar staff. One drink quickly turned into three or four.

Dinner time was fantastic and we dived into anything & everything Sri Lankan - all of it tasted so good.  We were half board for info and the food was buffet style for us. They lit fire torches outside adding to the atmosphere. Safe to say we slept well on night one ready for our first excursion of the holiday the next day.

Jetwing Lake is perfectly located for Sigiriya Rock which we went to the following morning. We then had a few hours relaxing by the amazing pool watching the birdlife, and then in the  afternoon we had our first safari close by at Minneriya National Park.

Our second evening and the following breakfast was just good as the first. During this breakfast we also ventured into the world of Egg Hoppers.  You have to try them!  The lady cooking the Egg Hoppers deserves a shout out for her friendliness, and cooking skills of course. 

The setting is beautiful and unlike anywhere we had stayed before and the level of cleaniness all around the hotel & gardens is definitely worth mentioning. Our room was spotlessly cleaned during our stay. Every member of staff we spoke to was polite & friendly & professional, from cleaners & gardeners to reception & restaurant staff. The sustainability & eco side of the hotel is also worth mentioning and it was nice to stay somewhere which has a real commitment to it.  Most of it you don't see but the little things, like water & bathroom condiments being refilled in glass bottles, I'm sure makes a noticeable difference.

From Jetwing Lake we went on to stay at Jewtwing St Andrews and Jetwing Yala later in the holiday and each of these hotels, although both different in style, was equally as good. I would highly recommend staying at any of these Jetwing hotels.","A great start to the best holiday ever!","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304133-d10626289-r995263288-Jetwing_Lake-Dambulla_Central_Province.html",,"1160","415960459","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/cb/0d/8b/dancfrench.jpg","1160","142","285","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dancfrench","dancfrench","400BC6928430BDB7FF40B081D0099F65",,"186291","Stroud, United Kingdom","Stroud","dancfrench"

While the hotel itself is beautiful and the location is stunning, my overall experience was disappointing due to a lack of proper communication. One of the key things guests should be aware of is that buffet meals are only provided if there are more than 50 guests staying at the hotel. Otherwise, meals are served as a limited set menu — something I was only informed about after I checked in, despite booking my stay a month in advance. 

This isn't just about the buffet. It's about how the lack of transparency can affect the entire guest experience. When you're paying a premium price, there should be more consideration and flexibility around such matters. 

I’ve stayed in other hotels across Sri Lanka — even during the fuel crisis — and they still managed to provide buffets and excellent service, regardless of guest count. So it’s disappointing that a hotel of Jetwing’s reputation doesn’t communicate clearly or make such efforts. 

To be clear, I don’t blame the staff — they were friendly and did their best. But this is a management issue. Guests should be informed of important service limitations ahead of time so they can make informed decisions. 

Again, it’s not just about the buffet — it’s about how such things, when poorly handled, can negatively impact what could’ve been a memorable stay.","Beautiful Hotel, But Poor Communication and Disappointing Guest Experience","2024-07","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1013621756-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dushyanthadeshan","Dushyantha D","2ABDBF7AAB7550A31CEF9E342E63E01F",,,,,"dushyanthadeshan"

The welcome with king coconut water was a refreshing touch after arrival. The rooms are spacious, well-furnished, and equipped with excellent amenities. Its commitment to sustainability is impressive—arguably one of the best I've seen.

I stayed in a sea view room, which was fantastic. It was just after the full moon—clouds moved across the sky, occasionally letting moonlight shine through. The atmosphere was serene, and I deeply enjoyed the solitude.

There are two swimming pools: one ideal for families, and another 25-meter lap pool that I especially appreciated—something I’ve rarely seen in hotels. Swimming there while listening to the crashing waves and watching them break into white foam was a unique experience.

The staff were warm and professional. Dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and very well arranged, offering a wide variety.

Overall, this was a memorable stay—one of the best in recent years. I definitely plan to return for a longer visit.","Exceptional Stay – A Solitary Moonlit Sojourn by the Sea","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1013066472-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"50","267254915","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/ed/fc/83/khairul-i.jpg","50","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84khairuli","Khairul I","F76091C400C0A621E7982845593806CD",,,,,"84khairuli"

From the moment we arrived, we were met with genuine warmth, attention to detail, and an atmosphere that perfectly blends luxury with the heart of Sri Lankan hospitality.

We were graciously welcomed by Umesha, whose kind and professional demeanor set the tone for the rest of our stay. She also hosted our afternoon tea, a serene experience overlooking the ocean with a lovely selection of teas, pastries, and savory treats. Her thoughtful care made the moment feel truly special.

Dining was consistently excellent across all three restaurants. Under the steady leadership of Awilse, every meal was served with precision, warmth, and attention to detail. The food was incredible—beautifully presented and rich in flavor.

Our children had an amazing time thanks to Imasha and Arushana, who organized creative activities like seashell jewelry making, stick figurines from coconut palm leaves, and a fun ice cream treat. They made our kids feel welcome, valued, and entertained throughout the stay.

The pool experience was another highlight, especially with Buddhika ensuring everything was clean, safe, and comfortable. The fact that the pool is filled with fresh, pure water from on-site wells was impressive—it made swimming feel even more refreshing. At the pool bar, Nimesh and Danidu stood out with their friendly and attentive service. Always serving with a smile, they made sure our family had everything we needed while relaxing poolside.

My wife also enjoyed a phenomenal spa treatment, which she described as peaceful and deeply rejuvenating.

Each night, we returned to a perfectly prepared room thanks to the daily turndown service—a small but impactful luxury that added to the overall comfort of our stay.

One of the standout experiences was the complimentary tuk tuk tour to Jetwing Kurulubedda, their sister property nestled in the jungle. The serene surroundings and breathtaking views of the six villas made for an unforgettable afternoon. We were served a unique and refreshing mangrove apple drink, crafted onsite and unlike anything we’ve tasted before.

Thanks to Imasha’s recommendation, we also enjoyed a guided tour of Galle Fort—organized entirely by the hotel. From the transport to the knowledgeable guide, it was the perfect way to experience the fort’s rich history without any hassle.

Adding a cultural touch to our stay was the traditional Kandyan dance performance hosted one evening at the hotel. It was a vibrant and captivating experience that brought Sri Lankan tradition to life right on the property.

One final note that truly impressed us was how well-maintained the resort is. We regularly observed quiet upkeep and repairs happening throughout the property—especially important for a beachfront hotel. It showed us how much care and pride the team takes in preserving the beauty and quality of Jetwing Lighthouse.

This resort is more than a destination—it’s a complete experience. Every team member, from the front desk to the bar staff, went out of their way to make our family feel at home. We left with full hearts, cherished memories, and an eagerness to return.

If you’re visiting Galle, do not miss the opportunity to stay at Jetwing Lighthouse. It is, without a doubt, a gem of Sri Lanka.","Jetwing Lighthouse – A Thoughtfully Curated, Unforgettable Stay for the Whole Family","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1011838190-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","0","25","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer06676152924","KM","5550512BA1E8ABA840D313692CEA60A0",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Dreamer06676152924"

Architecture:
Amaranthé Bay was built only 10 years ago, built for comfort with an American type of architectural design, similar to the Hilton or the Marriott.  Luxury and spacey, high tech but elegant.  Quality materials, the hard wood floor was a feature that I appreciated very much.  Sunlight fills the room all day long, the jacuzzi room could easily serve as a sauna.  The balcony with quality wooden chairs and table was comfortable to sit and watch the sunset plus the view of the lagoon and way over the yonder.  I loved the touch screen light control panel for all the lights throughout the 50m2 suite, the sitting room was spacious, the king size bed was comfortable, the big mirrors with surrounding led soft lights…big shower with rainforest shower head, good pressure and load of hot water.  
The towels are big and fluffy as they machined dry and not sundry, hence, it was a joy to dry myself with these towels.  I don’t mind sundry but machined dry feels like I’m at home in the states.  Amenities/toiletries were nice and handy, 2 one liter bottles of water daily more when we asked for more.  
Good housekeeping, a team of two male staff the whole time we were there.  They were very friendly, helpful and very polite.  
The ground was immaculately clean and well kept, ground keepers constantly on the move keeping the garden beautiful.  The pool guy was super friendly, helpful and thoughtful, no minute detail could escape his attention.  

Overall, the whole complex was very well designed and maintained, of course, it’s a tropical country with high humidity so there ought to be some damage to the paint but I noticed that they do their best with the up-keeping.  

Now the food was another matter entirely, there was absolutely no consistency.  One day it was fine from the buffet breakfast when there were more guests then the nest day same breakfast buffet but it was not well cooked or well prepared.   One time, the milk rice was cold and as hard as a rock.  Unbelievable!
The dishes weren’t authentic enough for us especially the level of spiciness, knowing that their dishes were prepared to serve guests that are not used to spicy dishes.  Hence, we made it clear to the kitchen staff that we wanted authentic spicy Sri Lankan dishes, it worked but as soon as there was a difference chef or not our usual server to take note then it all went back to square one again.  Well, needless to say, we were disappointed in the dishes they have in the menu.  Fixed menu when there weren’t enough guests, buffet when the hotel is busy.  

Though, we must give credit where credit is due, the management and the staff were very kind to accommodate our requests, they even took the dinner order ahead of time to make sure all was in order.  However, as soon as there was a change in staff or chef rotation, all the work went out the window.  There was a huge lack of communication, consistency and discipline.  
We enjoyed massively the accommodation but we were very disappointed in the dishes that they served.  We had high expectations before we arrived to Amaranthé Bay as we stayed at 4 Sri Lankan hotels before arriving to this lovely hotel and we had amazingly delicious and authentic cuisine until then.    We would return but will be eating elsewhere unless they made massive changes to their menu but will we risk it at the time of booking?","Beautiful Lagoon Views Amazing Spacious Room","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1015369004-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"590","769229382","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/d9/82/46/caption.jpg","592","1866","2057","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhatMinouSees","WhatEmmanuelleSees","B64E9CC03D05E51FDCD0C3A0609DEF06",,"190392","Andorra la Vella, Andorra","Andorra la Vella","WhatMinouSees"

	1.	The rooms are magnificent and all the rubbish about them being  poorly maintained is in my experience completely baseless. We had two rooms , as we wanted to stay at a higher floor , and they moved us. Both rooms were excellently maintained. 
	2.	Each room was extremely large  50 m2 and as it was a suite had both a jacuzzi and a normal shower room. 
	3.	If you’ve ever been to say Florida it reminds me a lot of say a Ritz Carlton Resort there … very Floridian vibe 
	4.	We’ve stayed this trip in much smaller boutique hotels in Sri Lanka which I probably prefer but that’s purely a personal preference 
	5.	What about the food ? Well I wasn’t that impressed at first as we booked half board directly with the hotel and I felt that the food was a bit bland as it has to cater to a very diverse audience and to be be honest we like fairly authentic hot local food. The management and the catering staff couldn’t have done any more to try to accommodate this after we let them know.  So well done to them. But I have to be honest here the restaurant completely lacks consistency. This is a last minute addition to my review and it’s a very sad comment to make . From the very first time we went to the restaurant we said we didn’t like our food bland so if we are ordering something Sri Lankan we expect it be authentically spicy. We would say that and it wouldn’t happen after a few days they got this right decent rice and curry etc. but on our last night there we ordered dishes we’d had before …both completely bland right back to square one  . I even had exactly the same dish I’d had the night before. …we had to ask for chilly to be added to both our rapidly cooling dishes after we’d tried them and the manager said the staff didn’t know we liked the food spicy as they cook everything with no spice . This is unacceptable for someone who’d eaten there 10 nights in a row. Maybe I’m being unfair but the wait staff knew ..the chefs knew as my wife spoke to them but the every time the managers in the restaurant got involved it was wrong. For a while we had the same waiter he would ensure we got what we wanted but constantly changing who it was is almost bound to lead to the inconsistency we witnessed. This is undoubtedly the biggest issue with the hotel which prevents it being what it absolutely could be. There is  no way I would chose to my eat the evening meal in the restaurant while it continues to be like this …..sorry but that is how it is. 
	6.	One other more minor thing I didn’t like but this appears to fairly consistent in Sri Lanka is the prices being quoted then plus this tax and that tax and service etc. probably fine for Americans who are used to this but most of the audience here isn’t used to that. Just tell me how much it is please ? As it’s got service than do we not tip does all that go to the staff directly ? Anyway that’s a criticism more of Sri Lanka than of the hotel  

So in conclusion would we stay there again ? Definitely..I didn’t see anywhere in Trincomalee or surrounds that looked any better or even close. I would definitely eat dinner out not because the chefs cant cook or the waiting staff cant wait but because sad to say they can’t deliver anything like consistency. 

What about Trincomalee? It’s certainly far less developed that further south. There is plenty to do. Rather surprisingly we saw two large wild elephants crossing the road just a couple of kms from the hotel when we went off to see the wild crocodiles in a lake 

I found I got much more smiles from people outside of the hotel  with the odd word or phrase in Tamil particularly the fishermen on the beach 

So back to the hotel. Staff try extremely hard to accommodate requests and were without exception extremely nice. Good examples of this include the guy at the pool who could not of worked harder running around getting towels,  cleaning the pool , keeping his eye on junior swimmers. The people who cleaned the rooms who worked extremely hard to keep the place immaculate, the gardeners who made the place so beautiful, the guy delivering the delivering the  bag who carried monster weight bags up flights of stairs. All these the small cogs in the wheel did their jobs with grace and smiles 

We stayed for 10 days so I think we got a good idea of how this place works. We also spoke to a Swiss guy and he had stayed there a month or so. No one would stay there that long at for Sri Lanka a relatively expensive place if it didn’t have high standards 

One final suggestion maybe it would be even better if it was adults only place ? Kids and a breakfast buffet is a recipe for sticky fingered disaster.","Excellent Floridian Style Resort","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1014889185-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1280","488436028","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1d/1c/f1/3c/barcaranger.jpg","1280","6610","3150","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barcaranger","barcaranger","2A88D2F4425230BE11F37DDE80D9C67F",,"190392","Andorra la Vella, Andorra","Andorra la Vella","barcaranger"

The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay, always making sure we were comfortable. The food was good, and we enjoyed everything we tried.

The resort’s location is stunning, surrounded by nature and calm waters. One of the highlights of our stay was the canoe ride — such a serene and beautiful experience that I’ll always remember.

	1.	We did not “change our minds.” We raised concerns before arrival.
We contacted Booking.com before arriving to request a cancellation waiver due to concerning recent reviews on Google. These were not isolated incidents, and many described exactly what we later saw ourselves: a worn-down, poorly maintained hotel far from what the photos suggest. Several of those reviews have since been reported and removed, just like the hotel tried to do with ours. This pattern of review suppression speaks volumes.
	2.	We were asked to lie in writing.
After we arrived, saw the condition of the hotel, and decided to leave, we were asked by hotel management to submit a written statement claiming we had changed our travel plans in order to be considered for a refund. That was completely untrue. We did not change our plans — we stayed in Trincomalee as planned and booked a new hotel 10 minutes before checking in, as shown clearly in our Booking.com account history. We have a recorded phone call in which this demand is made, and we have submitted this recording, along with all written correspondence, to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
	3.	The core issue is value and misrepresentation.
This property is priced like a luxury resort but does not meet that standard! The photos online are outdated and misleading. In reality, the hotel is old, visibly run-down, and poorly maintained. After traveling across Sri Lanka and staying in several more affordable places, it was shocking to find this was the most expensive and least impressive of all.
	4.	We have documented everything.
Every part of our experience — the false refund condition, the misleading photos, and the lack of cooperation — is backed by evidence: recordings, whatsapp communication, booking timestamps, and photographs. We have formally reported the hotel and submitted all materials to Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Let this also be a warning to not book with Booking.com (check their google rating reviews) since Booking.com has said they cannot assist! 

We stand fully by our review. It reflects a documented experience — not opinion, and certainly not defamation.

However, just two hours later, the guests arrived at the hotel and requested a full refund, stating they had changed their minds and chosen another hotel.

What we got was anything but. The property is dated, badly maintained, and extremely overpriced. After staying at several budget-friendly places around the country, we were shocked to find those were in better condition than this supposed five-star resort.

Upon arrival, we attempted to cancel and request a refund after seeing the state of the property — a request the hotel flatly rejected. Instead, we were met with condescending and unhelpful responses. One manager even insinuated a refund would be possible if we submitted a written statement claiming a change of travel plans, which was absolutely not the case. This felt like an attempt to rewrite the facts to suit their policies.

We have only left one public review (on Google) to date, yet the hotel accused us of damaging their reputation and suggested we remove it — making this entire ordeal feel more like a PR battle than any genuine customer service.

For those considering this hotel based on star rating or images — please read recent reviews and look closely at the photos. We do not recommend this property and are still in the process of resolving this through Booking.com’s head office.","Luxury in Name Only — Misleading and Mismanaged","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1010543227-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwD3370CM","M W","4207A00385DB00DD9DE455EACFB732ED",,,,,"mwD3370CM"

While we welcome constructive feedback, it’s important to clarify when reviews contain misleading information.

The guests booked via Booking.com under a strictly non-refundable policy, clearly outlined at booking and in the confirmation email. On the day of arrival, they cancelled last-minute, and as per the policy, full payment was processed.

However, just two hours later, the guests arrived at the hotel and requested a full refund, stating they had changed their minds and chosen another hotel. Despite the non-refundable terms, we offered a goodwill refund for unused nights—only charging the first night—on the condition that they update the cancellation reason for proper documentation.

The guests refused and instead posted a review containing false claims. We submitted all relevant communication to Booking.com to ensure transparency and fairness.

We remain committed to resolving concerns respectfully and truthfully, but cannot accept reviews that distort facts to damage our reputation. We thank all our guests who value fairness, honesty, and context.","1600","805459131","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/bb/caption.jpg","1200","1600","805459132","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/bc/caption.jpg","1200","1600","805459133","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/bd/caption.jpg","1200","1600","805459134","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/be/caption.jpg","1200","1600","805459135","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/bf/caption.jpg","1200","2048","805459136","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/c0/caption.jpg","1536","2048","805459137","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/c1/caption.jpg","1536","2048","805459138","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/c2/caption.jpg","1536","2048","805459139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/c3/caption.jpg","1536","2048","805459140","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/02/54/c4/caption.jpg","1536",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No. 101/17 Alles Garden Road, Trincomalee 31000 Sri Lanka","Trincomalee","Sri Lanka","31000",,"No. 101/17 Alles Garden Road",,"7788909","8.618372","Trincomalee, Eastern Province","81.21544","Amaranthe Bay Resort","1096","4.7","16","18","34","173","855","https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g424963-d7788909-Reviews-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html","http://www.amaranthebay.com","2025-05-29","MOBILE","1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We booked this hotel expecting a luxury experience to end our Sri Lanka trip. What we found on arrival was shocking: a severely outdated, run-down property that bore no resemblance to the photos or description. It was a massive letdown — especially given the price. Hostels and backpacker lodges in the area were in better shape and cost a fraction of the rate.

Before arrival, we became concerned after locals and recent online reviews raised red flags. On arrival, our concerns were confirmed — and we immediately expressed that we weren’t comfortable staying. Management’s response was dismissive, at times aggressive, and entirely unprofessional. Instead of addressing the issues, they insisted on keeping the full payment under the pretense of a “non-refundable” policy — regardless of the false advertising.

Worse still, we were asked to submit a written statement falsely claiming we changed our travel plans — something we refused to do out of principle. This was apparently required to “consider” a refund. We chose not to play along with that narrative and escalated the case to Booking.com.

We travel extensively and are always willing to pay for quality. This was not quality. This was a bait-and-switch disguised as a luxury resort. Avoid at all costs.","⭐ 0-Star: Severely Misrepresented and Managed with Arrogance","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g424963-d7788909-r1010190338-Amaranthe_Bay_Resort-Trincomalee_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452388139","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg","1200","0","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prY8898KQ","P R","CA8CE9D2F3DA7721C954B44919D6AF78",,,,,"prY8898KQ"

The swimming pool was the highlight ,many peoples were making reels for their social media. Kids loved the play area, again sea facing, open area. On our first day of stay, face painting was available. The health club was well-equipped with elliptical and treadmill machines, tried my hands for a quick workout.

In the night, there was the lavish dinner spread—a wide variety of dishes, and the Indian food, kadahi paneer to dasi and hopper,  was exceptionally good. Breakfast also impressed us with its extensive variety, kids have a lot of options to select their choice of food.

The bathroom was spotless, stocked with Taj branded toiletries, and the staff service was full of smiles and attentive throughout our 2 days of stay.

Greetings from Taj Bentota Resort & Spa

At the onset I would like to thank you for being a valued patron and delighted to know that you had a happy and comfortable stay with us.

I will share your feedback with our team and I am sure that this feedback will serve as an encouragement to all of our associates as we strive to create warm and memorable guest experiences.

Further to your feedback to the beds at the beach, wanted to share that since it is a public  beach, the beds are provided by the villagers. However as you would have noticed, the hotel provides the beds within the premises on the lawns

Also further to your observation on the LKR payment, the government has mandated for the room charges to be collected in USD. We do apologise that the team did not explain this better.

Thank you for your appreciation for our team members, Menaka and Chef Dalip. Your encouragement will further motivate them

Once again we thank you for sharing your valuable feedback and look forward to  welcome you back as and when you plan your next trip to Sri Lanka

Warm regards, 

Sibi Mathew

A couple of things did take away from the experience. At the beach, no beach beds were available unless we paid extra – which felt a bit unreasonable for such a basic amenity.

The location is convenient, right in the heart of Colombo and just across from the beach—though it’s important to note that you have to cross a busy road to reach the shore, so it’s not as private or serene as some other Taj properties.

The pool was decent, but felt a bit underwhelming after the stunning one at Taj Bentota. On the plus side, the food was  good, and a special mention goes to the passion fruit jam at breakfast—absolutely delightful!

Our room was neat and comfortable, though we missed having a balcony, especially in a coastal city. Also, the lawns and outdoor areas felt a bit neglected, not quite up to the usually impeccable Taj standards.

In summary, Taj Samudra offers good service and a prime city location, but could benefit from some updates and better outdoor maintenance to truly live up to the Taj brand.","Exploring new horizons 🇱🇰🎊✨️","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1015349302-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1440","682068266","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a7/89/2a/caption.jpg","1440","2","264","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246pragyat","Pragya T","5F1C1D24DF3A4F120110D06C00D9D6A0",,"297687","Dehradun, India","Dehradun","246pragyat"

Get to the pool early if you want a chair —‘great for total relaxation","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","Cinnamon Wild Yala is, without question, one of the most extraordinary places I’ve ever stayed—and I’ve traveled the world extensively. Tucked on the edge of Yala National Park, it offers a truly immersive nature lodge experience with an unmatched combination of comfort, adventure, and deeply heartfelt hospitality.

The grounds are stunning. I stayed in one of the beachside huts, slightly elevated with the ocean just visible through the lush foliage. Even when you can’t see it clearly, you can hear the waves—soothing and constant. Walking through the property at any time of day or night feels like part of the adventure: peaceful, a little wild, and deeply restorative. The rooms are lovely, spotlessly clean, with powerful air conditioning (a must in the Sri Lankan heat), and the overall environment is carefully maintained without ever feeling sterile. The entire property radiates a respect for nature and quiet luxury.

But the heart of Cinnamon Wild is its people. Every member of the team—from the staff helping guests move safely at night to the restaurant crew and naturalists—was professional, kind, and incredibly competent. I was traveling solo, and never once felt out of place, uncomfortable, or overlooked. Quite the opposite.

One man, in particular, made an unforgettable impression: Saman, who works in the restaurant and bar area near the lobby (not the rooftop). Saman is a gem of a human being—warm, genuine, and generous in a way that can’t be taught. He spoke to me about his children and his life with such honesty and kindness, making me feel completely at home without ever crossing a boundary. It’s rare to find someone so naturally gifted in service and connection. One night, he arranged a private, candlelit dinner for me by the pool—even suggesting I invite my delayed friends—and when I dined alone instead, he made sure I felt relaxed, welcome, and totally cared for. It’s hard to express how much that meant. Cinnamon Wild is incredibly lucky to have him. He embodies what true hospitality is meant to be.

As for the safari experience—this is the real reason to come to Yala, and booking through Cinnamon Wild is absolutely worth it. I paid $200 USD and felt it was a bargain. My experience was private—just me, an expert naturalist, and an incredibly skilled driver, both arranged through the lodge. Their knowledge of the park and its rhythms was astounding. Thanks to them, I had a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with a young female leopard—less than two years old, not yet named. She emerged gracefully and stayed near our vehicle long enough that we shared a real moment. I saw every kind of wildlife I could have hoped for. My friends, who booked outside the hotel for a cheaper rate, were deeply disappointed by comparison.

The Cinnamon Wild safari team doesn’t just “do the drive”—they read the land. Their guide knew exactly where to go, and the driver was not only skilled on Yala’s notoriously rough roads (I was totally comfortable the entire ride), but also respectful of the animals and other guests. This wasn’t tourism—it was reverence.

In short, Cinnamon Wild is a place I would return to in a heartbeat—and send my family and closest friends to without hesitation. It’s rare to find a property that combines this level of natural beauty, comfort, and truly exceptional human care. If you’re considering Yala, don’t think twice. Book Cinnamon Wild—and if you’re lucky, Saman will be there to greet you.","Glowing Review: Cinnamon Wild, YALA — A Once-in-a-Lifetime Safari Retreat","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r1015654034-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Theta_Carinae","Carina E","70E9DF004FE3B8E5601C6BA0E8E756D8",,"32655","Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles","Theta_Carinae"

From the second I walked in, the staff at the front office were super welcoming and check-in was quick and easy — exactly what I needed after a long trip from Colombo.
I stayed in a Jungle Chalet and it was really spacious, clean, and cozy. You feel so close to nature, it’s honestly such a peaceful vibe.
The safari organized by the hotel was AMAZING — I actually got to see a few leopards which was a huge highlight for me! The Nature Trails team did a great job and made it such a fun experience.
The food was also sooo good — totally worth it. But my favourite part of the whole stay was stargazing at the rooftop restaurant. It was magical! ✨
If you’re thinking of visiting, I’d say go for at least 2 nights — one night is just not enough to take it all in. I just can’t wait to go back!

Set along Sri Lanka’s largest river, the surroundings were incredibly peaceful. The swimming pool overlooking the river offered a stunning backdrop—perfect for unwinding and capturing some amazing photos.

The lavish dinner buffet was excellent, and we especially enjoyed the delicious South Indian options. Breakfast had plenty of variety, catering well to both local and international tastes.

Our room was comfortable and well-equipped, and though it didn’t have an ocean view, the river views were equally calming. The bathroom was clean and stocked with all necessary amenities, and we appreciated the thoughtful service from the friendly staff.

However, one drawback was the lack of a lift. We were assigned a basement-level room, which made going up and down a bit inconvenient, especially with kids.

Overall recommended for river view and lovely gardens.","Every destination has a story to tell 🧡🇱🇰🌿","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d797403-r1015348236-Cinnamon_Citadel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1440","682068266","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/a7/89/2a/caption.jpg","1440","2","264","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246pragyat","Pragya T","5F1C1D24DF3A4F120110D06C00D9D6A0",,"297687","Dehradun, India","Dehradun","246pragyat"

I’m sharing this feedback with the hope that it will be useful for the management to improve the overall guest experience.

Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with several aspects of our stay. There was a persistent drainage smell coming from the bathrooms, which made the rooms unpleasant. We chose this property based on the Cinnamon brand name and the expectation of a luxury experience. However, we felt let down, especially as we had brought guests with us and ended up feeling embarrassed by the quality of the accommodation.

The food experience was particularly disappointing. We ordered afternoon tea, which took over an hour and a half to arrive. Wanting to avoid the buffet, we opted for à la carte in hopes of enjoying authentic Sri Lankan rice and curry. Sadly, this too took over an hour to be served, and the quality was well below expectations. The fish curry was bland, more like boiled fish in salted water, and the other dishes were equally uninspiring. It felt like basic, careless cooking rather than a reflection of Sri Lanka’s rich culinary heritage.

Please pass this feedback on to the chef and kitchen team: authentic Sri Lankan cuisine deserves care, passion, and respect. It’s disheartening to see such a missed opportunity to showcase the country’s gastronomy to visitors.

While the front-of-house staff were friendly and did their best to accommodate us, the overall experience was marred by poor food service and quality. We’ve spent the past month travelling across Sri Lanka and have been consistently impressed by the hospitality and food elsewhere. Sadly, this was our most disappointing experience, and we left with great regret.

We sincerely urge the management to review the à la carte offerings and take immediate steps to elevate the culinary standards. Please don’t let the charm of this beautiful place be overshadowed by subpar food and service.","The most underwhelming food experience of our trip","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d797403-r1015294719-Cinnamon_Citadel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"510","725375320","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/59/58/amyamy18.jpg","510","1","18","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amyamy18","Ash","5F197CFCF7278E5A1E487A3F2B1F556A",,"186388","Surrey, United Kingdom","Surrey","Amyamy18"

Thank you for your amazing review! We're thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the magical river and jungle views, and that waking up to the mist and birds felt like a nature show from your balcony. It's wonderful to know that you found the rooms bright, clean, and roomy, and that the bed was super comfy after a day of sightseeing.

We're delighted that our staff made your stay special with their friendly service and attention to detail. It's great to hear that breakfast on the terrace was a win, and that you enjoyed the evenings by the pool with live music.

We're glad you appreciated the peaceful location and proximity to the Temple of the Tooth. Your kind words about our relaxed river views, great food, and warm Sri Lankan hospitality mean a lot to us.

We can't wait to welcome you back for another fantastic stay at Cinnamon Citadel! 🌟

Staff were next-level friendly. From the welcome drink to remembering my coffee order, they nailed the little things. Breakfast on the terrace was a win—string hoppers, fresh fruit, croissants, all while the river glided by. Evenings by the pool, lanterns glowing, with live music in the background? Perfect vibe.

The hotel is only a quick tuk-tuk ride to the Temple of the Tooth, but it still feels peaceful and away from the city noise.

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback. We're sorry to hear that your arrival experience was less than ideal, especially with the crowded pool on Sunday. We appreciate your suggestion about offering a complimentary drink during such times. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed the room, scenic view, and good service.

We arrived Sunday afternoon after hot trip to find the pool absolutely mobbed, no seats/sun-beds and a queueing system in place for a seat. Waited about one hr for a seat to become free (A free beer would have perhaps compensated for that!). Seems on Sundays the pool is open to the public and its packed.  Bad start. Pool was empty on Monday though., seems its just a ""Sunday thing"".  Room was good with scenic view over the river.  Good shower.  Caters to large bus tours and we were a two, so we really wanted to avoid the buffet-style eating with large bus parties which is a bit of a cattle-market.  We were shown to the bar as an alternative but, as others have commented, the seats there are very low and its not really suitable for eating.  We kind of felt like a second class citizens. Buffet breakfast was fine (Same as other Cinnamons), beautiful view onto river. Service was good. It’s not a bad hotel, but if you don’t care for the buffet and arrive on a Sunday, you will be a bit under whelmed.","Standard Cinnamon hotel which doesn't cater so well for A-La-Carte dining.","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d797403-r1010584575-Cinnamon_Citadel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"200","73466990","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/04/61/04/6e/bear858.jpg","200","47","135","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bear858","The Bear","65A7D77B8E785990AE8ACA9FF282FF62",,,,,"Bear858"

At one point, they didn't have tomato juice readily available, but the FnB Director ensured that they prepare a tomato juice in their kitchen, and get us to try that, if that's good! We were blown away by their warmth!
The rooms were fairly large, with a Balcony, and lovely view of the city and the lake in front....it rained that morning, and we had a lovely view of the rains from the balcony! Lovely restaurant with large spread for breakfast, with a nice sitting area outside as well.

Had come late due to traffic congestion of 4 hours. So decided order ala carte from room as it was raining outside. 

Called the restaurant and asked for dal and simple roti which they said “not available”. 

They don’t know the difference between buffet and ala carte in properties like radisson. Such properties usually provide food whenever required due to their high standards. 

Escalated the issue to the manager who was on leave and  so explained to duty manager that radisson cannot deny food and order being simple could be arranged. He said will look into the matter. 

Thereafter no one called and then they stopped taking the calls. Finally when we got in touch the restaurant told that they will send but didn’t ask how many rotis which we had to convey.

Later when food came we were shocked to see something else in place of rotis. Such a harassment for long time and non radisson like behaviour.

So would not suggest to stay here. Mean find other similar better property","Not following the standards expected.","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d7729062-r1012482021-Radisson_Hotel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drrd","Dr Ramandeep Si...

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the stunning architecture and the breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. Designed by the legendary Geoffrey Bawa, the hotel's aesthetic blends modern luxury with Sri Lankan heritage, creating a peaceful and elegant atmosphere.
The staff was incredibly warm and attentive, Jayan , Nimasha, Dhananjani and the rest of the staff were always ready with a smile and happy to assist with any request. The dining options were excellent, offering a mix of local flavors and international cuisine, and the seafood was especially fresh and flavorful.
Jetwing Lighthouse is a perfect blend of comfort, culture, and coastal beauty. I highly recommend it for couples, families, or anyone looking to unwind in style in southern Sri Lanka.","Unforgettable Stay at Jetwing Lighthouse","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297896-d302888-r1009226333-Jetwing_Lighthouse_A_Luxury_Reserve-Galle_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389098","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg","1200","7","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoshperera1991","Yoshitha Perera","12283969CAB026FE273F54FABA985272",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Yoshperera1991"

We're especially glad you enjoy dining with a view of the sea. It’s one of our favorite touches too, particularly at sunset. Your recommendation is deeply appreciated, and we look forward to welcoming you back for many more memorable meals in the future.

The Sri Lankan cuisine is rich, authentic, and beautifully prepared, making it a must-visit for food lovers, especially locals seeking refined traditional flavors. Prices are very reasonable considering the premium setting.

One of my favorite parts? You can choose a table overlooking the sea, which adds an extra layer of magic to the meal — especially at sunset.

The location is wonderful : beautiful garden, the lake and the hotel is gorgeous ! All the staff is very friendly and helpful, a special thanks to Imalsha our waiter (He was very kind and pay attention to us) and the housekeeping Ravindra (he made beautiful elephants sculptures with towels).  The two swimming pool are really nice. The hotel is a little piece of heaven.
Our suite was really nice, great equipment and the housekeeping was really well done. The room was really neat and clean like the rest of the hotel.
Some trouble with the wifi (unstable and poor but the staff tried their best to fix the situation) and a little bit of waiting time if your order A la carte at the restaurant. Nevertheless the food was delicious and the breakfast was really diverse 
We really recommend to stay at the Amaya resort if you look for luxury and peaceful retreat.","Peaceful and relaxing luxury stay","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r1015477553-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","9","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaellelaurents","GaelleLaurent S","C29F67E7DD194A19E9F8085DDFEC3D4D",,,,,"gaellelaurents"

Check-in was a breeze—smooth, welcoming, and full of warm smiles that instantly made us feel at home. Throughout our stay, the staff were consistently friendly, professional, and genuinely helpful. A heartfelt thank you to Devin, Shashika, Pubudu, Sandaruwan, Divya, Ishani, Roshani, and Sandushi – your hospitality was truly exceptional and made our stay so memorable. Keep up the amazing work!

Our room was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The housekeeping team was fantastic—always cheerful and ready to help with anything we needed. We especially loved the cozy beds, the reliable hot and cold water, the well-stocked minibar, and all the little thoughtful touches that made a big difference.

One of the best parts of our trip was just being surrounded by nature. Waking up to birdsong and spotting animals like squirrels, rabbits, crocodiles, deer, and even buffalo right around the property was magical. It really felt like we were part of the wild, in the best way possible.

A highlight for us was definitely the “Crocodile Day” event organized by the Nature Trails team. It was such a well-run and engaging session—complete with snacks, drinks, and fascinating info. Huge thanks to Rohan and the entire Nature Trails crew for making it such a fun and educational experience. We learned so much and really appreciated the effort that went into it.

The food at Cinnamon Wild deserves its own shoutout. Every meal was a treat, thanks to Chef Nandana Perera, Sachini, and the entire kitchen team. Everything was so delicious—we were seriously spoiled!

Special thanks to Sahan, the F&B Manager, and the amazing restaurant team: Himanshi, Champika, Heshan, Ishan, Danushka, and Umesh. And a big thank you to Himal, the Chief Steward, for being so kind and supportive.

All in all, we couldn’t have asked for a better getaway. I’d highly recommend Cinnamon Wild Yala to anyone heading to Yala.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala

Thank you so much for your kind and detailed review. We’re absolutely thrilled to hear that your stay in our Beach Suite was such a memorable and relaxing experience, and that you enjoyed the seamless check-in and checkout process. I’ll be sure to pass along your appreciation to Mr. Akash and Mr. Bandula for their excellent service.

It’s especially heartening to hear your compliments about our restaurant team – Sameera, Omesha, and the entire team will be delighted to know they made you feel so well looked after. And of course, Mr. Amar will be very proud to hear how much his cocktails added to your evenings – I’ll make sure he takes that well-deserved bow!

At the same time, I sincerely regret the discomfort caused by the unexpected presence of cockroaches in your room. Please accept our heartfelt apologies, especially knowing of your wife’s katsaridaphobia. While we maintain a rigorous pest control program, your feedback highlights the need for further enhancement in this area, and we are already taking immediate steps to address it more effectively.

Thank you again for choosing Cinnamon Wild Yala. It was a pleasure to have you with us, and we’re truly honored to know you plan on returning. We look forward to welcoming you back for another exceptional experience—this time, even better in every way.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala.

I'm delighted to hear that you enjoyed the comfort of our rooms, the quality of our food offerings, and the convenience of our location for your safari adventure. It’s also great to know that our team could assist with a packed lunch for your full-day safari—thoughtful touches like these are part of what we strive to offer every guest.

I truly appreciate your suggestion regarding the road access and pick-up service. You're absolutely right—the access road can be challenging, especially for low-clearance vehicles. While we currently base our transport support on weather and operational feasibility, your feedback highlights a valid point. I’ll certainly take this up with our team to explore more flexible solutions in the future, as seamless logistics are a key part of the guest experience.

Thank you once again for your honest feedback and for staying with us. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back again soon—with an even smoother experience from arrival to departure.

The rooms are nice and fairly spacious with good amenities. The food was also very good - we ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner one night. They also graciously packed us a lunch to bring while were out on an all day safari. To this end, I'd say it's worth just booking the all inclusive, as there are no other restaurants around the area. You're going to end up eating there anyway, so save yourself the trouble.

My only complaint is that our guide asked for someone from the hotel to come pick us up by security, as the roads in are extremely bumpy and he was concerned for his sedan. The hotel refused because it wasn't raining that day, and as such, our guide had to trek down a dirt and very bumpy road that wasn't made for cars. Having a service to pick-up guests between all of the hotels would have really made things feel smooth.","A Stay in the Wild","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d638092-r1012706876-Cinnamon_Wild_Yala-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"705","136235467","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/1e/c9/cb/amyadamy.jpg","705","131","412","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyadamy","amyadamy","BD4000413605C633073597F5BCB1B757",,"42391","Lansing, Michigan","Lansing","amyadamy"

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience with us at Cinnamon Wild Yala. I’m truly delighted to hear that you enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere of Yala National Park and had the chance to witness the incredible diversity of flora and fauna during your safari adventure. It’s wonderful that you were able to explore the beach and take in the powerful beauty of the ocean – it’s one of our favorite spots too!

We’re pleased that you found your room comfortable and enjoyed the wide variety of dishes available during meal times. Your kind words about Dhanushka’s service are greatly appreciated – I will personally make sure he is recognised for his exceptional hospitality.

Thank you once again for choosing to stay with us. We hope to welcome you back for another wild and memorable escape in the heart of nature.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan

The hotel has such a lovely team of staff working at the resort and they all helped create a fabulous break for my husband I celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We left on Saturday 7th June with lasting, fond memories and very much looking forward to visiting Sri Lanka again, if not in Bentota, we will definitely book another Taj hotel on the island.

 

We'd also like to extend our gratitude to all the unsung hero's working behind the scenes to create such a beautiful ambiance. The maintenance team, the gardeners, the chefs, they all do a tremendous job ensuring everything works well,  the grounds looking beautiful and the guests fed to such a high standard 

 

The house keeping staff looking after our room were exceptional and the waiters, waitress and guys working around the pool were all so friendly and never without a smile. The reception team were always welcoming and helpful and the security team and the front gate were always ready to greet us no mater what time of day or night.  There are too many names to remember but each and everyone of them deserves recognition for their hard work, enthusiasm and dedication.","A fabulous stay at a wonderful hotel","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1013646653-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391289","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g0r0nwy0","Goronwy O","35A6C9B4FAFA1DB7462D6770FCA5B97F",,,,,"g0r0nwy0"

Our rooms weren't ready but we're taken through to the lounge and given complimentary refreshments whilst we waited. Travelling with our 20 year old son, we had 2 rooms on the ground floor overlooking the gardens with glimpses of the sea and beach. Rooms spacious with plenty of hanging space but limited for drawers. Comfy bed and complimentary tea/coffee and bottled water replenished daily. Disappointed to only have a shower in the bathroom as we love the Tajs usual deep soaking tubs to relax in. Room was kept spotless by Rukmal and Happy. 

Food as always at the Taj was excellent, wide choice at breakfast and in the evening (we were staying on half board). Chef cooked us a few dishes to try including the best ever chicken tikka and a wonderfully spicy Sri Lankan chicken curry. Service in the restaurant excellent, particularly Asiri, who was professional, friendly and went above and beyond to make our visits special. We enjoyed the cricket chats and the wonderful service. We also dined in the Oriental Pavillion which was superb and the Fish restaurant which was nowhere near as good, service slow and despite informing staff I did not eat fish, was served a fish starter. 

Evenings were quiet in the hotel but free pool tables are a bonus in the bar and staff efficient and friendly.

Pool was mostly tranquil until the British children arrived towards the end of our stay and the constant shouting from Jack, Charlie and Louis caused us to retreat to the beach. No issue getting loungers or parasols and pool team very helpful at all times.

Outside the hotel are a small selection of restaurants and a shop selling soft drinks . About 5 mins walk is the village where there is a supermarket and the liquor shop (supermarket does not sell alcohol). There's a bigger town about 15mins walk away with more choice. We caught the train to Galle for the day which is very straightforward and well worth doing. Outside the hotel are tuk tuks and the drivers will take you wherever fkr a fixed price - we did the Bentota River boat safari and Turtle Sanctuary, both of which are recommended. 

A great hotel with fabulous staff and we can't wait to visit again next year (hopefully staying in a room with a bath!)","Fabulous hotel with fabulous staff","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1013622515-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","22","83","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/264bethk","Beth K","770DDA231F59C2AA14A63A5A792D3DDE",,"190807","Bideford, United Kingdom","Bideford","264bethk"

Dalip Singh and Kamal took care of us in a outstanding way and we felt really like being home at friends. Sam and his colleagues provided us with a perfect service at the restaurant.

As I always travel alone for business I also enjoyed my daily chat with Chaminda who was always keen to see how things were going. 

Sampath went so far as to attend meetings (at my invitation) with me so that he could translate when required and had then provided an invaluable follow up service. 

If I could package the caring nature and service of these two, I’d package it up and recommend it to business customers.

Right from the moment we checked in, we felt genuinely welcomed. The handwritten note in the room was such a thoughtful surprise — those little touches always stand out.

The birthday cake was really kind too, and very unexpected! We were travelling with a few friends, and all of us felt well taken care of. It’s rare to see such consistently warm service across the board, so please do pass on our thanks to the wider team as well.We especially enjoyed our dinner at Yumi — amazing food and a great atmosphere. It was the perfect way to end the day.

A special shoutout to Mr Karan Maini and team for making the stay special and one of the best we have had.

Thanks again for everything. We had a great time and hope to return soon.","An exceptionally comfortable experience, distinguished by impeccable hospitality and a truly luxurious setting.","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1013303660-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise60561164855","Paradise60561164855","7CEF81271BB2FD62E06C3E7CEDB1087F",,,,,"Paradise60561164855"

What stood out was how kind and attentive everyone was, without it ever feeling forced. From the check-in to little things like a note in the room and a birthday cake the gestures really stayed with us.

The hotel itself is lovely, but it was the people who made it feel relaxed and welcoming. My friends felt the same. We all left talking about how well we were looked after.

Also, Yumi totally lived up to the hype. The food was spot on and the staff made sure we were well looked after.

Left with good memories.

As soon as I entered, the staff was very warm, welcoming, and attentive such that I have felt special during my stay.

The location is perfect, right across the ocean with breathtaking views and conveniently close to key landmarks in Colombo.

The hospitality was excellent. As soon as we entered, we were greeted by the friendly staff with  smiles and typical Sri Lankan hospitality.
Special thanks and shout out to  to Ms. Thamali Wijesiri and Mr. Samrat Datta who ensured every detail of my stay was perfect and fabulous. We are grateful  to them for  going above and beyond to make our experience so memorable and unforgettable.

  My room was very large with all the amenities and was as clean as could be with a lovely Balcony overlooking the sea which made mornings even more special. The bed was very comfortable and the room service was quick and efficient.
The pool surroundings were calm and well kept and provided an oasis of tranquility in the city. I also liked the green gardens and the feeling of serenity that the premises gives although located in a busy area of Colombo.

I really liked the buffet breakfast and Dinner at POC, a huge variety of local and international dishes.One of the greatest highlight of our stay was the fact that there was Indian vegetarian food available. As vegetarians, we felt quite pleased to get the original and tasty Indian food . A big  thanks to Chef Nair and Chef Anuj. I cannot fail to mention names of Ruwan and Dasum who served not only efficiently but also with a smile which was very impressive.

One can hardly find this kind of commitment and elegance in service, and the staff of Taj actually embodies the gist of Indian and Sri Lankan hospitality.

On the whole, Taj Samudra combines classic style and the service of the international level. I would definitely recommend  it to other business as well as leisure travelers.","A Holiday we will always remember","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d304700-r1012542193-Taj_Samudra_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAYARAVIB","Jaya Balia","72066D3CD880DC723355B8D94A780A57",,"297613","Vadodara, India","Vadodara","JAYARAVIB"

Regarding the spread of food - flavorless, bland and without much to imagine.
Had only three types of fruits.
Cannot put into words how disappointing this experience was. How we call this a five star hotel is beyond my wildest understanding.
Side note - the doors in the bathrooms were hanging on to their hinges, the dustbin was overflowing and the food, terrible.

We’re truly honored that you chose Amaranthé Bay to begin your journey together as a newly wedded couple. May your life ahead be filled with endless love, happiness, and cherished adventures together Mr & Mrs.Gayan Alwis!
Reading your review titled “Heaven of Trincomalee” truly brought smiles to all of us at Amaranthé Bay.
From the moment you arrived in the early hours of the morning, it was our pleasure to welcome you with warmth and care. We’re delighted that you felt looked after right from your first steps into the resort, and we’re so glad our team—from the reception welcome to the smooth check-in, refreshing drinks, and luggage assistance—made a lasting impression.
We deeply appreciate your recognition of our front office manager Priwin for assisting with your booking, and Mr. Sri, our sales manager, whose genuine hospitality and thoughtful arrangements helped ensure your stay was nothing short of exceptional. Your compliments about the fruit platter, the beautifully decorated bed, and your upgraded stay in the Junior Suite with Jacuzzi mean so much to us.
It’s wonderful to hear that Jacintha from Housekeeping, Dilshan at the Bar, Singam by the pool, and all the restaurant and service staff made you feel well cared for. Your kind words about guest relation Mayuran and the bellboy Suji who assisted with your luggage have also been warmly shared with them—they’ll be thrilled to know their service stood out.
We're especially happy that the lagoon boat tour arranged by Mr. Sri added a magical experience to your time with us. Your heartfelt praise for our rooms, food, and service being of five-star quality is the highest compliment we could hope for.
Thank you once again for taking the time to write such a detailed and generous review. It was a joy to have you with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back for more cherished moments in Trincomalee—perhaps for your anniversary next time!
With our warmest wishes and gratitude, Amaranthé Bay.

On behalf of all of us at Amaranthé Bay, thank you for spending four nights with us and for sharing such kind reflections on your family’s experience.
To be considered “the best hotel in Trinco” in your opinion is a compliment that humbles us deeply. We are delighted to know that your stay provided the perfect blend of comfort, privacy, and relaxation — just as we intend it to be. Our entire team works with great passion to create a peaceful and welcoming environment, and hearing that you found the property clean, beautiful, and quiet means so much to us.
It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed starting your mornings with our breakfast selection — our chefs will be thrilled to know their efforts made a positive impression. We're also glad you had the chance to explore the local charm with dinner by the sea — Trincomalee’s coastal setting has so much to offer, and we’re happy you were able to soak in the atmosphere both within and beyond the hotel.
Your kind mention of relaxing by the pool paints a picture of tranquility, and we’re so pleased those quiet moments brought peace to your stay. We’re especially happy to know that your room provided the space and comfort your family needed to truly unwind.
A special thank you for appreciating the service provided by our staff. It brings us so much joy to know they were able to assist you promptly and help organize your snorkeling trip to the breathtaking Pigeon Island — it’s truly one of the gems of this region, and we’re glad you got to experience its natural beauty.
Your words, “We liked it all,” and your warm recommendation mean the world to us. Welcoming families like yours is what makes our work so meaningful, and we look forward to the opportunity to host you again whenever your travels bring you back to Trincomalee.
With Deepest Thanks, Amaranthé Bay.

To be called “the best hotel you've been to in 33 years” is truly an honor we will cherish.

It warms our hearts to hear that you all had a blast, and that your floating date experience turned into such a magical moment for you and your wife. Creating those special, once-in-a-lifetime memories is exactly what we strive for.
Your generous praise of our service — rating us not just 5 stars, but a 10 — truly humbles us. Our team is passionate about delivering genuine hospitality, and it’s incredibly rewarding to know that this was felt throughout your stay. Mayuran, who you so kindly mentioned, is deeply grateful for your recognition, and so are Suji, Kogulan, Kirujan, and Senthooran — all of whom were thrilled to be part of your journey with us.
And your compliment about our kitchen team — saying they cook like they've been trained by Gordon Ramsay — has absolutely made their day! They pour heart and soul into every dish, and knowing it reached you and your family in such a memorable way means everything to them.
Thank you once again for your trust, your kindness, and for taking the time to share your experience. Families like yours are the reason we love what we do, and we truly look forward to welcoming you back for another unforgettable escape in Trincomalee.

The hotel is located very close to Bandaranaike International Airport, which makes it an ideal choice for travelers with early flights or layovers.

The check-in process was quick and smooth, and the staff were polite. The room was clean, quiet, and equipped with all the basic amenities needed for a short stay, including a comfortable bed, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and a private bathroom with hot water.

The hotel offers a restaurant with a decent selection of meals and snacks, which was convenient after a long journey. I also appreciated the airport shuttle service, which was punctual and saved me the stress of finding transportation.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback.

I’m pleased to know that your overall impression of the resort was positive and that you found our team — especially Danushka — to be warm and welcoming. He is truly dedicated to creating memorable experiences, and I will be sure to pass along your kind words to him.

That said, I sincerely regret the areas where we fell short of your expectations. We appreciate you pointing out the maintenance concerns with the pool tiles, sunbeds, and in-room AC. Your observations are noted and already being addressed with our engineering and housekeeping teams to ensure timely improvements. Our goal is always to offer a seamless blend of comfort and nature, and attention to detail is a critical part of that.

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and provide you with a more refined experience on your next visit to Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala

What an absolute pleasure it was to read your heartfelt feedback — thank you for taking the time to share such a beautifully detailed reflection on your stay at Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Hosting you and the Cinnamon Hotel Management team on your familiarization trip was a true privilege. I'm especially glad to hear that, despite being part of the wider Cinnamon family, you felt fully immersed in the authentic guest experience we strive to create.

It brings me great pride to hear how warmly you were welcomed and looked after by so many members of our team — from Sandushi, Achala, Divya, and Pradeep at check-in, to Chef Manjula and Himal in the kitchen, and Sahan, Amar, and Thamoth at the bar. I’ll be sure to pass your kind words along to each of them — they’ll be overjoyed to know they made such an impression.

And of course, thank you for highlighting the incredible work of Sampath Gunasinghe. His deep knowledge and passion for wildlife is something we value immensely, and I’m thrilled it added so much meaning to your safari.

Your words truly mean the world to me and to our entire team. Knowing that you felt the magic of the wild, the warmth of our service, and the joy of great hospitality is exactly why we do what we do.

We can't wait to welcome you back to Cinnamon Wild Yala for another unforgettable adventure in the heart of nature.

Yours sincerely,

Lashanthan Gopalan

Even though we were part of the Cinnamon team, we made it a point to be treated just like any other guest, and the staff absolutely respected that. Their warmth and hospitality were so genuine — it truly felt like home in the middle of the wild. If I had to describe the experience in one word, it would be magical.

From the moment we checked in, everything was smooth and hassle-free. Huge shoutout to Sandushi, Achala, Divya, and Pradeep for making the check-in process so seamless.

The food was incredible, especially the breakfast buffet! Thank you to Chef Manjula and Himal for not only preparing such delicious food but also checking in on us to make sure everything was up to standard — it absolutely was.

Now onto the cocktails... Wow. A massive thank you to Sahan, Amar, and Thamoth — our amazing bartenders. Hands down the best cocktails I’ve had. If you visit, please try the “Jungle Fowl” — it’s an explosion of flavour and leaves you wanting more!

A big thank you as well to our Nature Trails Yala safari guide, Sampath Gunasinghe. Your knowledge, stories, and passion for wildlife added so much to the experience. It made the safari feel personal and inspiring.

And finally, to Resort Manager Lashanthan Gopalan — thank you for being so warm, friendly, and attentive. You have an incredible team who clearly love what they do. It shows in every interaction and creates such a welcoming, authentic vibe.

To anyone who loves wildlife, nature, and a bit of adventure — I couldn’t recommend Cinnamon Wild Yala enough.

Greetings from Cinnamon Wild Yala.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback following your recent stay at Cinnamon Wild Yala.

I’m so pleased to hear that you enjoyed the unique charm of our lodge-style rooms — especially the four-poster bed, spacious walk-in shower, and the thoughtful amenities we’ve curated to enhance your comfort. It's wonderful to know you appreciated the different experience of staying in a lodge amidst nature, rather than a traditional hotel room.

Our poolside bar is certainly a favorite spot to unwind, and I’m glad you enjoyed the views and atmosphere there. The escorted walks after dark are all part of ensuring your safety in our unique wilderness setting, and I’m happy to hear you felt well taken care of.

Being just minutes away from Yala National Park, we’re fortunate to offer our guests the perfect blend of adventure and relaxation — and it’s great to know you enjoyed the plentiful breakfast choices before heading out to explore.

Thank you again for choosing to stay with us. We hope to welcome you back soon for another memorable experience in the wild.

The hospitality and service of Taj staff was second to none and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We made many special requests to accommodate the needs of my mother and all of them were catered for. 

The food was excellent - as you would expect of a Taj hotel! But a very special mention to the chefs Jasveer Singh and Piyush, who went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying the food (we were perhaps the few vegetarians staying at the time) and sent across specially curated plates of vegetarian food for us. 
Breakfast included traditional Sri Lankan, Indian fare along with a continental spread and an omelette station. For dinner we tried the Oriental Pavilion on one occasion, which was really good but limited in choice for vegetarians. We then had a la carte dinner at the main restaurant (when we were indulged with extra plates of food) and the buffet dinner on another occasion. For lunch, we ordered a la carte and ate by the poolside. 

The service at the restaurants even during busy periods such as breakfast and dinner was very efficient. In true Taj Bentota style, no one was ever hurried and took the time to answer queries we had around local outings. Thanks to Sam, Janitha, Dilshan and the rest of the staff! 

The rooms were very comfortable. We had requested two adjoining rooms and we were given a lovely suite. Jinendra, our room cleaner, would add the fun touch to his cleaning by creating towel animals in the rooms. The spa treatments were very relaxing with time before the actual treatment in their steam room, which was a nice treat and the most delicious detox ginger tea after. The concierge staff were very helpful in terms of answering queries and helping us organise trips to see the local area and very accommodative of the requests we made, on behalf of my mum.

Prices do reflect what you would expect at a Taj hotel but then again so does the service and quality. We’ve stayed at many resorts and hotels and the hospitality and service at Taj Bentota is worth mentioning. 

All in all, it was an excellent stay and I would recommend the place to anyone looking for a stay in Bentota.","Family holiday","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012930709-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452392029","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sumitrav2022","Sumitra V","EC7573BECD92E97EC820ED1F65F48351",,,,,"sumitrav2022"

It wasn't the same level as the Taj we are used to (e.g. Taj Village) but it was okay. The housekeeping staff are amazing. Samal was really an asset and I hope they promote him because he has been in the same job for two decades or so. The air conditioning is centrally controlled so there is no way to adjust this. The technician came a few times and then with duty manager but they could not repair it. The duty manager suggested to me that the problem was me as no one else had complained about it! 
All in all the warmth was missing from this hotel. The breakfast was a bit chaotic and if one wanted something, one had to go to the senior staff or chef. 
We also saw the waiter handling the basil leaf on our food by hand, just before laying it on our table. Yuck!
There were some protests outside the hotel from the locals who were complaining about the hotel. There is a train track right next to the hotel so one can hear trains pass by at all hours and of course they honk from time to time. 
The water in the pool was naturally warm and one could swim even if it rained. On one ocassion the staff wanted to go home so they made us come out of the pool on the pretext that they could see the rain approaching but there was no rain.  The other restaurants within the hotel were not really tasty or usable. We tried to go outside but were recommended a very bad, overpriced but terrible tasting restaurant by our tuk tuk guy. The waiters were letching at the small children. Do not go outside to the restaurants around. Potentially try the other luxury hotel nearby which also has their own restaurants. We did not try those. Overall an ok experience but would not be going again.","Okay but not great","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012661887-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452391608","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LemonGrass2087","LemonGrass","300EC75495F33D2C0FC1D565AE5CCF2B",,,,,"LemonGrass2087"

About 30 minutes later, we were informed that the room was ready, though we were cautioned the floors had just been cleaned and would dry in five minutes. Since it was lunchtime, we decided to head to the restaurant first and returned to the room about 20 minutes later.

Within minutes of entering, my wife slipped in the bathroom due to a pool of water left on the floor, which had clearly not been dried properly. She sustained a painful sprain and a deep cut on her arm, requiring medical attention. The injury disrupted our plans for the remainder of our stay.

What made matters worse was the hotel’s lack of urgency or compassion. When she called guest services to report the incident, the executive was dismissive and abruptly ended the call. We had to escalate the matter ourselves, eventually speaking with the General Manager, Mr. Sibi Matthew. Instead of acknowledging the seriousness of the lapse, he attempted to offer inducements — which felt inappropriate — rather than expressing genuine concern or accountability.

We’ve always associated the Taj brand with high standards of care and hospitality, having stayed with them for over 25 years. Unfortunately, our experience at Taj Bentota fell well short. The poor housekeeping, lack of supervision, and unprofessional handling of a safety incident have cost us two out of three days of what should have been a relaxing holiday.

I would urge future guests to exercise serious caution. We expected better — especially from a brand like Taj.","Serious Safety Incident and Disappointing Staff Response at Taj Bentota","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012536795-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"769","115069900","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/db/d3/cc/rajeevm19.jpg","769","114","302","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajeevM19","RajeevM19","09A997B8318C195F492E35EA940BCF39",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","RajeevM19"

From the minute we arrived, the staff greeted us with  warm smiles and  Sri Lankan hospitality.

We enjoyed a fantastically smooth and welcoming check-in experience at Taj Bentota. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient, and we felt right at home. 
A heartfelt thank you to the check-in staff, Ms. Nilusha, for  smooth check in.

The  location is spectacular, directly on the beach with breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean. The hotel is wonderfully designed, with lush gardens, a relaxing pool area, and direct beach access for long, tranquil walks. 
 Our room was spacious, very clean, and well-maintained, with a private  sea view big balcony . Housekeeping performed an excellent job . The beds were really comfy, and room service was efficient and pleasant.
 As vegetarian tourists, we sometimes struggle to find variety and flavour while dining overseas but Taj Bentota exceeded all of our expectations.
The resort provides an excellent assortment of Indian and International vegetarian food, both at the buffet and ala carte. Every dish was freshly prepared and very tasty. 
The chefs were more than happy to accommodate our food choices  and we felt genuinely cared for and a major reason for that was the outstanding culinary experience, led by the incredibly talented Executive Chef Piyush Mishra.  I express my heartfelt gratitude to him for making our stay memorable, taking the time to understand our food choices and ensuring that each meal was a lovely experience.
A special thank-you and shout out to the Indian chef Dilip Singh whose cooking  made us feel at home. From delicious curries to  tasty South Indian items at breakfast,we enjoyed every bit of it.
I cant miss out to mention names of Maduka ,Bimal , Ruwan,and Janitha who not only served with efficiency but also with a smile, which made a lasting impression.

Overall, Taj Bentota is an ideal blend of nature, comfort, and elegance, complemented by Taj's hallmark hospitality. We are already looking forward to returning! Highly recommended for romantic and family getaways.","A holiday ,we will always remember..","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012501675-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAYARAVIB","Jaya Balia","72066D3CD880DC723355B8D94A780A57",,"297613","Vadodara, India","Vadodara","JAYARAVIB"

A loyal Taj customer and a shareholder I was expecting a pleasant experience, as I usually have experienced.

As the room was not ready, we waited for over 45 minutes after which we were told that the room was ready but the bathroom was wet and would dry up in 5 minutes.

However since our toddler was hungry, we did not head to the room instead it to the restaurant. After a quick light meal that took about 20 minutes, we headed back to the room and my wife visited the toilet.

Instead of experiencing a dry floor, they was stagnant water on which my wife slipped and had a long cut on her arm. 

Guest services was dismissive about about this, no regret, and rather the lady abruptly disconnected the call.

We were offered a visit to the doctor and a first aid kit, however, the first aid kit did not have a disinfectant which is necessary for cleaning up such a wound or a cut.

After a while, the general manager, Siby Matthew came to meet us, wanting us to calm down, offering to make up for the horrendous experience. We were enticed with better service room, upgrades, blah blah blah.

It smacked of insincerity and a lack of ownership. This was absolutely criminally negligent to let a guest check in when the room is not in a position to accept visitors and to top it all the attitude of guest services to bang the phone and not having a well stocked first aid kit. This is nothing but criminally negligent behavior that the management of IHCL has to take notice of.

As a loyal Taj customer for over 25 years and Ash shareholder was stood by you through the troughs of Covid, you have already broken my trust and faith.

I would definitely not recommend this property to anyone even my worst enemy.","Absolutely inhuman and insensitive staff - DO NOT STAY HERE!","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306383-r1012379688-Taj_Bentota_Resort_Spa-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625rajeevm","Rajeev M","01540372FB0AEEB4F25BB4A0EED1E7AE",,,,,"625rajeevm"

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We’re truly sorry to hear that your recent experience did not meet the standards you expected from a Radisson property.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the oversight in recognizing your VIP membership and the confusion regarding your points redemption. This is certainly not the experience we aim to provide, and we are addressing this with our team to ensure better attention to detail and guest recognition moving forward.

We also regret that the service and food quality did not meet your expectations, and your comments have been shared with the relevant departments for immediate review.

We appreciate your loyalty and hope you’ll give us another opportunity to deliver a stay more in line with the standards you deserve.

Warm Regards,

One of the best surprises was the Global Gem Hub, a gem shop located away at the back of the hotel lobby. It may be easy to miss, but it’s a true treasure. The prices here are much more affordable compared to outside shops, and the quality of the gems is exceptional.

What really stood out was the staff .the salesmen are genuinely trustworthy and honest, which is a rare and refreshing experience when shopping for gems. They took the time to explain everything and made me feel confident in my purchase without any pressure.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused during your stay at Cinnamon Citadel. It is deeply regrettable that the top floor rooms were flooded due to heavy rains, and we understand the difficulties you faced in arranging alternative accommodations. This is certainly not the standard we strive to uphold at Cinnamon Properties.

We are also sorry to hear about the interaction with our F&B Manager.  We appreciate your feedback and will address this matter internally to ensure it does not happen again.

On a positive note, we are glad that the rest of our F&B staff were cooperative and worked hard to make your group happy. We value your feedback and will use it to improve our services. Thank you for your understanding and patience during this challenging situation.

Unfortunately a considerable number of guests complained about the accommodation of the hotel as most of the top floor rooms were flooded due to leakage of it's roof due to heavy rains. I had to find alternative rooms together with front office staffs and hotel was also running almost full house on the same day.
Somehow with greatest difficulties, we managed to get the alternative rooms arranged and matter was sorted.
However this type of a situation cannot be accepted at all with so called ""Cinnamon Properties""

As this was an incentive group and whole tour was with Cinnamon properties (Lodge, Trinco Blu & Cinnamon Citadel) we have arranged a cultural dance show at the hotel (arranged and paid by the Travel Company) and venue was approved in written format by the Assistant FOM. 
In spite of all those, the F & B Manager (Nalin or Naleem) came and spoke to me in a very rowdy manner with an unacceptable attitude. Then I clearly informed him that I do not want to have any conversation with him.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. While we're pleased to hear your kind words about Christina at the reception, the refreshing orange cordial, and the poolside ambiance, we are truly sorry to learn that your overall experience did not meet your expectations.

We sincerely apologize for the service shortcomings you encountered, especially in regard to your requests while traveling with a baby. This is certainly not the level of hospitality we strive to deliver. Your comments about inconsistency in service and the unavailability of basic items like water at night are very concerning, and we take them seriously. Please be assured that we are looking into these issues with our team to ensure such lapses are not repeated.

Your experience is not reflective of the standards we uphold at Cinnamon Citadel Kandy, and we deeply regret any inconvenience caused. We appreciate your feedback as it helps us improve, and we do hope you will consider giving us another opportunity to offer you a stay that truly reflects our commitment to hospitality.

You come to Cinnamon Citadel expecting greatness but it just leave you wanting.
Starting with the positives - Christina at the reception is really helpful and can really brighten up your day. The orange cordial is amazing and so is the location of the pool and the bar but the buck stops here.
The service or whatever they may want to call it is pathetic to say the least. We were travelling with a baby and they were least accommodative in all their efforts. Ask them for fresh apples or cookies or dates and all they can say is that we don’t have them and the next minute they shall be serving the same to someone else.
The worst part, we asked for water on the first night at around 10pm and they stated that everything is closed and we shall not be able to provide.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. While we’re truly glad to hear that you appreciated the beautiful surroundings, peaceful ambiance, and the overall layout and cleanliness of your room, I sincerely regret that several aspects of your stay fell short of expectations.

First and foremost, I apologize for the difficulty you faced in reaching us prior to your arrival. This is certainly not the level of responsiveness we strive for, and your comments will be taken seriously in reviewing and reinforcing our communication standards.

We also regret the inconsistency in the information you received at check-in. Your concerns regarding the bed configuration, balcony maintenance, room service availability, and billing transparency are valid, and I assure you these have been brought to the attention of the respective department heads for immediate attention and corrective action.

We are especially sorry for the moments where you felt the service was not up to the Cinnamon standard. While we do provide opportunities for trainees to gain experience under supervision, your feedback clearly highlights the need for more consistent guidance and confidence-building among our team members.

Your insights are truly valuable to us, not only as a guest but also as a fellow hotelier. We understand your expectations, and we deeply regret that your visit did not reflect the standards we are known for.

Thank you again for your candid observations. We genuinely hope you will give us another opportunity to offer you the seamless and relaxing experience you originally sought.

Warm regards,

Served the purpose... up to a certain extend. I would say, the ambiance is amazing. Mountains, the river and the quite surroundings are a definite seller. Balcony was private, spacious and peaceful. Take a bit of effort and the rest can be amazing too.

I won't say the whole experience was unsavory but the bitter bits were avoidable without any effort at all. At first, I tried to reach the hotel for two days and no one picked up. Messages went unanswered. When they finally decided to pick the telephone, on the third day, it was after 6 or 7 rings.. I was shocked. 3 rings is the golden rule. At check in, I was told that the information provided over the phone was slightly incorrect. I had to stand on my grounds for the reception staff to accept the fact that it's either stick to what I was told or I walk out. 

Walked into the room, beautiful, spacious and very cozy room. Well arranged and spotless. Loved the interior. Alas, the bed was two twins made as twin beds, for a couple booking!!!! The reason given was, we upgraded you... I did not come to stay  as a hotelier, I came as a guest and to forget about work. At the end I had to think as a hotelier and ask the staff to convert the bed to a Double using the bedding. One of the very first things every hotelier does when the occupancy is high. And the staff didn't think of it.. Blasphemy.  

There were some minor maintenance issues, almost unnoticeable. But the balcony door wasn't one of them. The rollers were not working. Only one side could be opened properly. The curtains had clearly visible stains and the headrest of the bath was either moldy or worn out. AC was blowing the whole night. I understand it's a 4 star but none of the four stars in my cluster will dream of selling a room with these conditions.

Room Service was closed by 11pm I think. Given the location of the hotel, not having a 24*7 room service is a bit of a turn off. When we ordered room service the next morning, it took more than 30 minutes for the food to arrive. 

The staff clearly needs to be trained on telephone etiquette. You don't hang up on a guest in the middle of a conversation. Happened all the four times we called. Looks like the majority of the staff are trainees. The boy who came to convert the bed was scared to talk, the girl at the reception withered when I spoke in a firm tone. 

Invoice does not show the base price and tax. I had to ask why am I charged extra for the minibar cos it did look like an extra charge. The receptionist had to explain that the price is including tax. Not the best approach when it comes to billing. 

When I book into a Four Seasons , I expect the standards of the chain regardless of the location or the star rating. When I booked Cinnamon, I expected the standards of the Cinnamon. Painfully, it wasn't the case. I was disappointed. 

Clearly, the place needs more attention to match the price tag.","Needs a lot of Ironing","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d797403-r1007804554-Cinnamon_Citadel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"769","294970952","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/94/e6/48/angel0fdeath.jpg","769","64","600","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aNGeL0FdEAth","aNGeL0FdEAth","C62F9407600EB4408BF65CE6BF1B3119",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","aNGeL0FdEAth"

We are absolutely delighted that your stay at Amaranthe Bay in February was everything you had hoped for—and more. Your kind words truly bring a smile to our faces, as we take great pride in offering a peaceful retreat where our guests can unwind and enjoy the natural beauty of Trincomalee.
It’s fantastic to hear that you loved the serene ambiance of our landscaped gardens and the superb pool, which we’ve carefully designed to create a haven of relaxation. The Mahaweili River Estuary is indeed a breathtaking sight, and we’re so pleased that you had the chance to admire the thriving wildlife from the comfort of your mini suite. The presence of diverse bird species and fish makes it a truly special experience, and we love that you found it just as mesmerizing as we do!
We greatly appreciate your compliments on our modern fixtures and furnishings. Over the years, we have continuously upgraded our facilities to ensure that our guests enjoy both contemporary comfort and an elegant touch of nature. Knowing that you noticed and appreciated these enhancements reassures us that we are on the right path in creating an exceptional guest experience.
Your generous praise for our staff is truly heartwarming. We believe that hospitality goes beyond service—it’s about making genuine connections and ensuring every guest feels at home. We are so glad that our team’s friendliness and attentiveness made your stay even more enjoyable. Your special mention of Kirujan is greatly appreciated, and we will be sure to pass along your kind words to him. He will be thrilled to know that he contributed to making your time by the veranda, terrace, and poolside even more memorable.
It was also our pleasure to arrange your excursions and assist with Tuk-Tuk rides to explore the local attractions. Trincomalee is a place of rich history and stunning natural beauty, and we love helping our guests experience all that it has to offer.
We are especially delighted that you enjoyed our Valentine’s shellfish banquet by the river. Creating magical moments for our guests is something we are passionate about, and knowing that this special evening was a highlight of your stay brings us immense joy.
Thank you once again for taking the time to share such a detailed and thoughtful review. Your words mean so much to our team, and we couldn’t be happier that you had a fantastic time with us. We truly hope to welcome you back in the future for another tranquil escape in Trincomalee!
Gratefully Yours, Amaranthé Bay.

The hotel fixtures and fittings are very modern and it has obviously been updated since some of the reviews from the last decade.

The room was adequately spacious but a bit too small for a triple. Maybe there was another bed, and that did hamper the space inside the room.

The pool and bar were on the top terrace, and it was very scenic and served up good nibbles and cocktails. A good mix of signature cocktails was also available. Beer and other liquors were also served

The food was also delicious, and we tried some signature cocktails (Raddison Heat and Raddison Fever) were also exceptional. The atmosphere was elevated with music from the 5 piece calipso and the  guests who were dancing to their lovely tunes.

The road leading to the hotel entrance has a school, and it was blocked because of the haphazard parking of the trishaws, school vans, and parent's vehicles. The hotel should guide these culprits to be more disciplined as it is bad publicity to the hotel and Sri Lanka if this is not addressed. I actually turned back on my first attempt as it was blocked and assumed I had taken a wrong entrance and on my second attempt it was again blocked and it took 15 to 20 minutes and a lot of circumspective driving of 300m to reach the hotel. This should be resolved quickly before it is escalated to a more unbecoming situation. Law enforcement should take action to resolve this if everything else fails

But that is external and besides the stay was wonderful nevertheless. 

I will definitely contempt another visit and will recommend the Raddison Kandy to everyone!

Thank you, Raddison Kandy!!","Our first but certainly not our last!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304138-d7729062-r1006627059-Radisson_Hotel_Kandy-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html",,"301","217123522","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/f1/0a/c2/niroshanajaya.jpg","301","66","156","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiroshanaJaya","Niroshana J","BBFB3D31D9BF9C9032C64B48E1AD5D30",,"3595837","Kelaniya, Sri Lanka","Kelaniya","NiroshanaJaya"

He was clearly on another planet, tried to hand us a couple of Iranian passports (presumably trying to get rid of us?) and then did the bored, rattled off intro, might have well not bothered, it wasn't a great welcome.

I also strongly recommend booking a massage!","Great experience!","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304137-d477912-r1010300518-Amaya_Lake_Dambulla-Kandalama_Central_Province.html",,"1024","353023824","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/0a/b7/50/sara-t.jpg","1024","0","2","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sara_sst","Sara","1B939416A6CE0A2AB98D0ABA7FEA9117",,"580268","Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal","Vila Nova de Gaia","sara_sst"

Thank you for your kind review and for recommending Amaya Lake. We’re thrilled to hear that you and your family had a wonderful and relaxing stay with us.

Your compliments about the pool, garden, and our friendly team, especially Mr. Salinda, are greatly appreciated. We’ll be sure to share your kind words with him.

We’ve also noted your feedback regarding the western breakfast buffet variety. Your suggestion is valuable, and we will certainly look into enhancing our offerings to better cater to all our guests.

It was a pleasure to host you and your family, and we hope to welcome you back for another enjoyable stay soon.

Even though the bar was quite busy, he made sure we were well looked after with friendly and attentive service. Later in the evening, once things calmed down, he took the time to chat with us and really made us feel welcome.

The lakeside ambiance is absolutely beautiful—calm, relaxing, and perfect for a peaceful night out. Highly recommend visiting, and a big thank you to Nuwan for the amazing hospitality!","A chill beer paired with the lake breeze.
