Super sauber, großzügig mit viel Platz, einem herrlichen Badezimmer und sogar einem privaten Pool nur für uns. 

Gern nutzen wir auch den großen Pool direkt am Meer, wo wir uns gut erholen konnten. Auch dieser war wunderbar sauber und kaum waren wir da, brachte man auch schon Auflagen und Handtücher vorbei. Ganz toller Service.

Auch das Spa haben wir genutzt und wohl mit die besten Massagen erhalten, die wir je hatten. Vielen Dank.

Das allerbeste waren jedoch die Mahlzeiten. Die Qualität der Küche ist erstklassig und der Service, den uns unser Butler Prabath zum Essen, aber auch in der Villa geleistet hat, war wirklich vorzüglich. Alle unsere Wünsche wurden direkt erfüllt und es gab nichts zu verbessern. Zudem hatten wir immer das Gefühl absoluter Sicherheit im Hotel.

Dass dies alles - auch in Sri Lanka - seinen Preis hat, versteht sich von selbst. Als kleinen Tipp könnte man hinterlassen, etwas kurzfristiger zu buchen. Dann gibt es oft etwas günstigere Preise.

A big shoutout to our personal butler, Rushan, who really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. He was always there when we needed anything, super friendly, and really made us feel at home.

The food was excellent too – every meal was delicious and there was a great variety to choose from. Whether we were dining by the pool or in the restaurant, the quality and service were spot on.

The staff paid attention to even the smallest details, like tailoring the menu to our specific tastes and adding dishes simply because my fiancée mentioned a craving. We were also surprised with a celebratory cake upon our return visit, a thoughtful gesture that truly touched us.

Special thanks to General Manager Mr. Farrel, who took time out of his busy day to check in on us, reassure me when I had last-minute nerves, and ensure everything unfolded seamlessly. Mr. Badde, our butler, was incredible, no request was too small, and every detail was handled with care and precision to make our stay truly perfect. Even the cleaning staff went the extra mile by preparing our room during dinner so we could return to a space ready for a restful night.

What makes Saman Villas stand out isn’t just the luxury, but the sincerity and warmth of the people. Their dedication to sustainability is also evident throughout the property, from the eco-friendly amenities in the room to the thoughtful practices observed during our stay.

Saman Villas will always hold a special place in our hearts. It’s more than a resort, it’s an experience that blends serenity, luxury, and genuine hospitality.

Greetings from Jetwing Jaffna!

Reading your review was a truly moving experience for all of us here at Jetwing Jaffna. Your words touched not only our hearts but also reaffirmed why we do what we do, with care, with sincerity, and with the deepest respect for every guest who walks through our doors.

To hear that you felt more like family than a guest is the highest compliment we could ever receive. That warmth, that sense of belonging, is exactly what we strive to create, because in Jaffna, hospitality isn’t a profession, it’s a way of life.

Your generous recognition of our team means the world to us. Each of them brings their own quiet strength, kindness, and genuine care into the spaces they serve. Knowing that these qualities made your stay so memorable is truly rewarding. We will be sure to share your kind words with them, they will be deeply touched.

We’re also delighted that you enjoyed our rooms, our cuisine, and the essence of Jaffna visible just outside your window, the temples, tuk-tuks, and trees you so poetically described. You captured the spirit of this town as beautifully as you experienced it, with openness and grace.

Thank you for taking the time to write such an eloquent, soulful reflection. Your words now form part of our story, just as your presence became part of our journey. You will always have a home here with us.

With heartfelt gratitude from The entire Jetwing Jaffna family.

Vanakkam!

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I wasn’t treated like a guest—I was welcomed like family. There's something beautifully genuine about the way the entire team connects with you. 

It’s not just hospitality here—it’s heartfelt care. Every need was anticipated, every request met with warmth and flexibility, and every interaction made me feel completely at home.

Let me begin by applauding the leadership of Mr. Sujeeva, the hotel manager. Calm, courteous, and incredibly hands-on, his quiet dedication reflects in every corner of the hotel. 

Whether it was a special meal request or a last-minute change in our schedule, his team's responsiveness and Mr. Sujeeva’s attention to detail made our stay seamless and memorable.

Special gratitude to the exceptional concierge staff:

•Mr. Prasad, with his encyclopedic local knowledge and thoughtful recommendations, made every outing in Jaffna a meaningful experience.

•Ms. Mathumitha, whose gentle kindness and ever-present smile brought a special warmth to every interaction.

•Mr. Jeeva, so quietly efficient and considerate—his service came from the heart, not a script.

They didn’t just assist us; they cared for us. That’s something no star rating can measure.

The rooms were immaculate, with modern touches blended beautifully with Jaffna’s cultural elegance. From the window,
 I watched the town pulse with quiet energy—temples, tuk-tuks, and trees swaying in the coastal breeze. It felt peaceful and alive at the same time.

The food was extraordinary. Every meal was a celebration of northern Sri Lankan cuisine—spicy, soulful, and unforgettable.

 I had a few dietary preferences, and the kitchen was wonderfully flexible and thoughtful. It's rare to see this level of attention even in high-end hotels.

Above all, what stayed with me most was the sense of being looked after like family. Jetwing Jaffna isn’t about luxury for the sake of it—it’s about comfort, community, and care. 
If you're traveling to the north of Sri Lanka, you’re not just visiting a place—you’re stepping into a rich culture and warm hospitality. And there’s no better base than Jetwing Jaffna.

To Mr. Sujeeva, Mr. Prasad, Ms. Mathumitha, and Mr. Jeeva thank you for making my trip unforgettable. 
You are the heart of this hotel.","A Soulful Stay in the Heart of Jaffna – Jetwing is Hospitality Redefined","2025-06","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d9566109-r1013077889-Jetwing_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",,"2048","808144125","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/2b/4c/fd/caption.jpg","2048","0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer24083070679","Sahan Mackenzie","6158F94E7DC4A8F1D6E87916322D8E11",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","Explorer24083070679"

Both my wife and my Parents were born and bred in Jaffna and they came to Singapore to work and start a family. They are long gone. We were apprehensive of going to Jaffna. Anyway we chose Jetwings and we were not wrong. From the onset Nixon was helpful in booking our Rooms. On the day of arrival we  were very fortunate to have met Mr Amaran a Senior Manager there. He was very friendly and professional. When he heard that it was our first visit and wanted to visit our late Parents homes, he went the extra mile to brief our driver on the route to take etc. It was a wonderful gesture and we managed to find their homes.
The Rooms in the Hotel was good and cosy. The food was Super and service was very good.
Mr Amaran also checked on our well being over the 02 nights we were ther.","Great Visit To Jaffna","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d9566109-r1012968963-Jetwing_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",,"1200","452387690","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","1200","0","11","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore63062595259","MPS Rajan","58B8B1B7585351B1ECC505AD0A5F0B19",,"294265","Singapore, Singapore","Singapore","Explore63062595259"

From the moment we arrived until our departure, we experienced world-class hospitality. The warm, enthusiastic, and friendly service at Jetwing Jaffna truly stood out.

The front desk team provided a personalized experience and kindly offered us our room even though we arrived early in the morning.

The breakfast buffet at the beautiful second-floor restaurant was wonderful, and the restaurant staff gave my family a very warm welcome. The food was amazing, and we thoroughly enjoyed the authentic Jaffna cuisine.

Throughout our two-day stay, the staff looked after my family with exceptional care and a never say no attitude.

I highly recommend Jetwing Jaffna to my friends and family.

The estate is beautiful and the rooms are large and comfortable. It was nice having a small electric heater fireplace in the room as the weather was chillier than expected since you are up in the mountains. A very different climate than we came from in Colombo. The experience feels like being a guest in the home of a friend (a very well-to-do friend) more than a hotel because the stay is so warm and welcoming. 

Every meal in the restaurant was a delight. (You must try the Sri Lankan breakfast.) Janaka provided wonderful service and we were always given way more food than we could eat but wished we could finish it because the flavors were so good. Not just the taste but also the presentation of each dish was well done. 

The private sauna experience in the spa was a nice, relaxing surprise. While I did not personally take advantage of the other spa services, my husband enjoyed his Vietnamese massage. 

The ability to communicate with the staff via WhatsApp proved very convenient and Staicy was always prompt, polite, and helpful in her responses. 

Since we visited during the rainy season we hired a car to drive us around to the tea plantations and waterfalls. If we had wanted to walk to town, it would have only been a short 10 minute walk but we wanted to see some of the sights a bit further out.

I had my doubts about the hotel despite excellent rating. 

Ambience 
In the middle of the Nuwara Eliya yet peaceful. Most points / places to visit (except tea estates and farms) are walking distance. 

Rooms
Spacious airy. Modern yet with old colonial charm.
Rooms have most amenities available in regular hotels.

Staff 
Courteous, friendly and caring. A big shout out to Stacy and Janaka who made our stay even more comfortable. Stacy is helpful, knows her brief and whilst toeing hotel policies still manages to make your stay more comfortable and fun. Janaka was always around - he followed our food requests to the T. 
Irshad without hesitating subscribed to a channel we wanted. It was amazing no questions asked - you are our guest you want it we will get it (for reasonable requests).

Food and Restaurant 
The best hoppers I have had ever. Super light and delicious. Our first time experience of 4 course breakfast - local fruits, granola with curd, hoppers with 4 curries and 2 sambals least course tea/ coffee/milk. 
We were asked our food preferences / dietary restrictions they were followed. 

The three course dinner was amazing! 

Only down side they don’t have 24 hour kitchen - so if you are the kinds who has food cravings middle of the night not sure if this place is for you. 

Amenities 
Plunge pool cum jacuzzi, steam room and sauna room. All three are situated in the out house with the spa. Only issue we faced was that the pool, steam and sauna were in such a small area that the steam from the steam room hits you on the face (whilst in plunge pool) if anyone opens it’s door.

I would not recommend the jacuzzi being on if you have young children who are also going to enter the pool with you. As the chlorine in the water and pressure from the jacuzzi spouts can make their eye really burn.

They have bicycles and also offer horse riding for a price. 

The horse rides and horse care takers were both very good. The first say they took us up the single tree mountain and next day they offered to take us on a different route through the race course and ‘forest’. The price u thought was high but after enquiring rates at tourist points it wasn’t that bad plus these horse rides are with people known to the hotel sand arranged through themso it’s better.

Conclusion 
Worth a stay if you don’t have young children with you.","Surprisingly amazing","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d25983119-r1010695188-The_Bellwood_Manor-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452388761","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","1200","21","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/na2506","na2506","F32186E80E4079B104A38B668FA575FD",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","na2506"

I recently spent two nights at the Shangri-La Colombo at the end of my journey along Sri Lanka’s South Coast. I genuinely wish I had stayed longer. As with every Shangri-La property I’ve visited, this one delivered exceptional service and luxurious comfort from start to finish.

Arrival & First Impressions

From the moment I arrived, the front desk staff greeted me warmly, offering a refreshing cold drink—a much-needed touch after a long flight. The lobby and reception area were stunning, with a grand, elegant atmosphere that immediately made me feel pampered. Staff were always around, attentive without being intrusive, and genuinely hospitable. Their consistent presence and helpfulness made me feel supported throughout my stay.

Room & Upgrade Perks

Thanks to my American Express Platinum benefits, I received an upgraded room along with a $150 USD credit at CHI, The Spa. My room was nothing short of luxurious, with a super comfortable bed, a spacious bathroom, and a beautiful walk-in shower. The ambiance and decor reflected a calming, high-end aesthetic that was perfect for unwinding after travel.

CHI, The Spa Experience

I fully maximized the spa credit with a 90-minute deep tissue massage—an intense yet much-needed treatment. I honestly think the masseuse broke me (in the best possible way). It was powerful, therapeutic, and exactly what my body needed. I also added a collagen face mask and a hot oil hair treatment, which left me feeling refreshed and cared for. I wanted to book more treatments, but they were fully booked, and my time was limited—so I highly recommend making reservations early. A special shout out to Geethma at CHI Spa, very friendly, front desk staff who organized everything with a beautiful smile.

Breakfast & Dining

Breakfast was included in my stay and featured a generous buffet with both Sri Lankan and Western dishes. I sampled local favorites like dosai, idly, hoppers, uppuma, and curries, alongside more familiar options like eggs, bacon, sausages, and cereals.

A quick heads-up for fellow travelers—Sri Lankan breakfasts are not shy with spice, which gave my morning a real kickstart! That said, I found some of the food, like the milk hoppers, a bit bland. They tasted more like plain hoppers; adding more coconut milk and a hint of jaggery or sugar would have made a big difference. Overall, the buffet leaned slightly toward a mass-produced flavor, and I think a bit more attention to seasoning could elevate the culinary experience.

Pool, Location & Facilities

The 4th-floor pool area was a highlight, offering breathtaking views of the ocean and city. I arrived just in time to catch an incredible sunset, which made the experience all the more memorable.

The hotel is directly connected to the One Galle Face Mall, making it super convenient for shopping and dining. While I felt the mall could benefit from a better mix of stores, the convenience factor was a big plus. I also appreciated that the surrounding area felt safe and walkable, even at night.

Nightlife & Exploring Colombo

One evening, I took a relaxing 10-minute walk to the Honey Beach Club, a nearby bar and nightclub. It wasn’t very lively midweek (I was there from Wednesday through Friday), but I imagine it picks up more on weekends. Still, the walk itself was pleasant, and the hotel’s location makes it easy to hop in a Tuk Tuk or car to explore other nightlife options around Colombo.

Final Thoughts

As a solo traveler, I couldn’t have asked for a more seamless and indulgent experience. From the outstanding hospitality to the comfort and elegance of the room, and the rejuvenating spa treatments, the Shangri-La Colombo provided the perfect end to my Sri Lanka journey.

While a few elements—particularly some of the buffet dishes—could use refinement, the overall experience was luxurious, welcoming, and thoughtfully designed. I felt completely safe, cared for, and relaxed throughout my stay.

If you're traveling solo and looking for a blend of elegance, convenience, and personal care, I highly recommend Shangri-La Colombo. It exceeded my expectations—and then some.

The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of Colombo with sweeping views and easy access. The neatness and attention to detail were impressive — everything felt pristine, polished, and thoughtfully designed. And of course, the cuisine was a highlight — diverse, flavorful, and beautifully presented. 
One minor issue, however, was with the parking process. Guests entering for weddings or events should be clearly informed (at the entrance or via signage) that a parking pass is required to avoid payment. I had to return to the event hall  just to obtain one, which could’ve been avoided with better guidance. Despite this, the overall experience was top-tier — a perfect blend of elegance, atmosphere, and exceptional service.

There was no room left for one person to get off the double bed, as the rollaway bed was squeezed in. This is definitely not what would be classed as triple, although it was booked and charged as one.
Although feedback was provided to Shangri-La (Colombo), these were simply dismissed. We were told that Shangri-La does not have triple rooms, so to accommodate triple room requests they simply put a rollaway bed, with no thought to the placement of this bed in the room. I am not certain which storeroom they dug out the old, dusty, rollaway bed from. The “bed” was still partially covered in sticky tape and bits of plastic and was not what I expected from a five-star hotel. We stayed at several 5-star hotels during our trip to Sri-Lanka in April 2025, including the Galle Face hotel and never encountered such poor service.
What I expected from a hotel of this caliber is to attend to our concerns, view our room and see if anything could have been improved.

It’s not the kind of place with dramatic views or luxury features, but the surroundings are quiet and refreshing—trees, open sky, and the kind of calm that makes you slow down without trying. It’s a good choice if you want a simple, relaxing stay away from the noise.

The rooms are clean, comfortable, and have all the basics you need. Nothing too fancy, but everything works well and feels thoughtfully put together. There’s a sense that the place is cared for, both inside and out.

What really stands out is the staff. Everyone we met was friendly, down-to-earth, and helpful without being overbearing. Whether you needed directions, tips on where to go nearby, or just a quick chat, they were always ready with a smile. It felt more like being welcomed by hosts than just checking into a hotel.

Overall, this is a great spot if you want somewhere simple, peaceful, and well-run. The setting is gentle and natural, and the people make it even better. Would definitely return for a quiet weekend away.","A calm, pleasant spot with great staff","2025-04","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g12901411-d4878877-r1002069729-Aliya_Resort_Spa-Avudangawa_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452389492","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697kavishkar","Kavishka R","B30CAE8B51B1AA2641D647059F422C40",,,,,"697kavishkar"

We also went on an afternoon Elephant Safari led by Akash, the resident Naturalist.

We have stayed in lots of different places over the years and this is the first time we have ever decided not to stay.

On entry, the hotel was lovely with a real wow factor and walking into the gardens was so peaceful. We were then taken to our room which we knew was at the very bottom of the garden - we were taken by tuk tuk (back out of the hotel grounds onto the main road and then quite a way down a couple of back alleys).  On asking where the path through the garden was for us to walk to the main part of the hotel (either for breakfast or in the evenings) we were told there was a dispute with the neighbour who had locked a gate meaning we could not walk through the garden and we would have to use the route the tuk tuk had taken.  This was a good 10 minute walk; at night the alleyways were pitch black (several potholes, dogs and dog poo) and the main road extremely busy.  We in no way felt like we were part of the hotel and felt very remote. We were also advised the hotel were not offering evening meals (as advertised).  All of these things were advised to us very factually rather than as an apology.

The room was advertised as being accessed by 2 sets of stairs (what it didn’t mention was that one set were extremely steep, up a narrow space with no handrail and then at the top you actually access the room through a hatch, similar to a boat).  To lock our room we had to use a chain and padlock.  There were lots of monkeys to see from the room but do be aware that as from about 6am they are extremely noisy jumping on the roof and the room is very light as several of the windows had missing blinds.

Once we had seen our room we did ask if we could change room into the main part of the hotel but they were fully booked and we therefore made the decision to stay overnight (by then it was getting late) and leave the next day.

I rarely write a bad review as I appreciate things can go wrong and I feel it’s how they are dealt with that is important but on this occasion I feel the review is justified. We should have received prior notice about the path being closed (and evening meals not being served) so we could make our own decision whether to change our booking without losing time on our holiday having to make alternative arrangements and find different accommodation.  Also, I think the access to the room should be made much clearer prior to booking.  Whilst we had no issues, others may struggle with the steepness of the stairs with no rail and getting in and out using the hatch style door. 

It does appear to be a nice hotel and very peaceful considering how busy Marissa is but care should certainly be taken when making a room selection.","Caution!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d2054131-r997171373-The_Spice_House_Mirissa-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","143","1163","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AztecLife","AztecLife","811200C00F2444C3BEBE2FD6465A67C4",,"186216","United Kingdom","United Kingdom","AztecLife"

We stayed just for one night, but the owner took the time to meet us on arrival and talk through her recommendations regarding the local area, including restaurants and activities. 

We had a whale watching trip booked, so we were leaving early in the morning which meant we'd miss breakfast, but the owner prepared a little take-away breakfast for us to take on the boat which was such a nice touch and we really appreciated it. However, one thing we wanted to mention is the owners response to our whale watching trip that we had booked in advance. It was very clear they had a preferred tour company, which was not the one we had chosen to go with, and they were quite negative about them and made suggestions for us to go with another company. Although I am sure the owner had good intentions and just wanted us to have an enjoyable time, it did make us feel a bit uncomfortable and we did worry we had chosen a bad tour company. However, we stuck to our guns and continued our boat tour with the company we booked with and we are glad we did because we had a great time. I would perhaps say to the owners that if they felt another provider is better, they could have contacted us prior to our stay to recommend the other company as telling us the day before just made us feel quite anxious.","Beautiful hotel in Mirissa","2024-11","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1407334-d2054131-r982606783-The_Spice_House_Mirissa-Mirissa_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurabV1758UF","Laura B","11680FAFCEA9AD32F1DE0AC652B6F06E",,,,,"laurabV1758UF"

Ruwan gave us a tour of the property, which is even more impressive in person than in photos. The lush flora and tiered gardens are stunning, and while there are a few monkeys nearby, they’re not a bother. The lovely pool offers a perfect view of the gardens. That evening, we dined at Ruwan’s recommended local restaurant, Petti Petti, where the food and service were excellent. Tuk-tuks are easily accessible for getting around.

Wir waren dort mehrere Nächte zu Gast. Hervorzuheben ist ganz klar der Pool und die gesamte sehr grüne Anlage.

Wir waren in der ersten Etage des Nebenhauses untergebracht. Das Zimmer war sauber und bestand eigentlich aus 2 Räumen plus einer Außendusche. Hinzu kam ein großer Balkon mit mehreren Sitz-Gelegenheiten. Von hier aus konnten wir viele Tiere (Streifenhörnchen, Affen, Mungos, Echsen usw.) und Vögel in allen Farben bewundern. Das ganze hatte Dschungel Feeling. Platz hatten wir insgesamt wirklich genug. Die Räume hatten Ventilatoren und das Schlafzimmer eine Klimaanlage. Leider war diese völlig unterdimensioniert und zusammen mit den Ventilator einfach zu laut. Mit der doch sehr harten Matratze konnten wir uns ebenfalls nicht anfreunden. Das zusammen hat uns einen nicht besonders angenehmen Schlaf gebracht. Leider gab es kein Wasser seitens des Hotels auf dem Zimmer, sodass wir mit dem TukTuk mehrfach bei Einkaufen. Wer duschen möchte, muss sich auf fehlenden Wasserdruck einstellen. Für meine Frau mit langen Haaren sehr ungünstig, ich hatte keine Probleme. Übrigens, einen Föhn gibt es auf dem Zimmer nicht. Das Frühstück wird  mit anderen Gästen zusammen (teils lange Tische) auf der Terrasse des Hauptgebäudes eingenommen. Es war leider sehr westlich (Obst, Ei, Konfitüre und Toast) mit einer kleinen Probe der heimatlichen Küche. Die Lage des Hotels ist wirklich gut, es sind nur wenige Minuten bis zum Strand (Turtle Beach) oder zum Instagram Hotspot Coconut Tree Hill. Von einem kleinen familiär geführten Hotel hätte ich etwas mehr erwartet und ich meine keinen Luxus.

We stayed in the Clove Cottage which was rustic but beautiful. It was very private with a balcony that looked out over the jungle. The gardens were beautiful with lots of different colours of the native plants. There were lots of monkeys, squirrels, peacocks and beautiful birds to keep us entertained. The staff were fantastic. They would always stop and speak to you to ask how you were going, what you were doing that day and if there was anything they could do for us. They were the absolute best. The breakfast was different everyday with a mixture of Western and traditional. They did the best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten. The pool was nice and warm so easy to get into and overlooked the beautiful gardens. 
The beach is just across the road and town is a 5 minute walk or a quick Tuk Tuk ride. There are plenty of places close by to eat or drink.
My only negative is the roof over the balcony keeps the breeze out and makes it a bit hotter but I understand the roof would be perfect if it was raining so it's not really a negative.
I would recommend this place in a heart beat and would like to thank all the staff for making our stay here so enjoyable. 
If we ever go back to Mirissa would never stay anywhere else.

Don’t miss the local restaurants and pubs that surround the hotel, it’s amazing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the **Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel** in Colombo was nothing short of exceptional, and we were fortunate enough to stay here twice—once when we first landed in Colombo, and later when we had a layover before our flight the following day. Both times, the experience was truly memorable, and this hotel has now become one of our favorites.

Nestled beautifully on the bank of **Beira Lake**, the hotel’s location is perfect, offering a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the city. Surrounded by the modern skyline of high-rise buildings, including other major hotels, the view from this property is simply breathtaking. It is a stunning blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty, and the moment we arrived, we felt the luxurious yet welcoming atmosphere.

The check-in process was impressively smooth and high-tech, handled entirely on an iPad, which was a refreshing experience. Special thanks to the young trainee, **Mr. Dulimina**, and his manager, **Mr. John**, who went above and beyond to offer us a lake-view room. Their hospitality was top-notch, and we were thrilled with our room.

The room itself was spacious and pristine, offering a spectacular view of the **swimming pool**, **Beira Lake**, and the majestic **Lotus Tower**, which can be seen in all its grandeur, especially at night when it lights up in dazzling colors. The nighttime view of the Lotus Tower from our room was simply enchanting, making the entire stay feel magical.

The housekeeping team did a fantastic job, keeping the room spotless throughout our stay. We were especially happy with the attentive service, as we were provided with water bottles whenever we needed them, even late into the evening.

The **breakfast and dinner** experiences were absolutely WOW! The **Sri Lankan cuisine**—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—was superb, and the hotel’s elaborate menu of **Indian, Asian, and Italian** dishes left us spoilt for choice. Every meal was a delightful treat, and we truly enjoyed the variety and the delicious flavors.

One of the best things about this hotel is its **central location**. It’s close to local pubs, restaurants, and popular tourist spots like the **Dutch Museum**, which was one of our favorites to explore. Another highlight for us was the **live music** played at the bar, located right in the lobby. Sipping drinks while enjoying the tunes and overlooking the swimming pool made for the perfect relaxing evening.

During our stay, we also had the pleasure of experiencing some amazing events. One memorable night was the **Saturday dance and fun event** hosted by the hotel. It’s a plush event for outside guests, but for hotel guests, entry is free—though drinks are extra. It was a great way to wind down and enjoy the lively atmosphere. As a bonus, we had the chance to meet members of the **Sri Lanka and Bangladesh women’s cricket teams**, who were staying at the hotel, and we even witnessed a beautiful **Sri Lankan wedding** taking place. These unexpected extras added so much to our experience, making it all the more memorable.

Finally, we have to extend a big thank you to **Joshua**, **Tharushi**, and **Madhushikha** from the restaurant, who welcomed us with such warmth and smiles every time we dined there. Their kindness and service made our stay even more enjoyable.

Overall, our experience at Cinnamon Lakeside was absolutely wonderful, and we will **definitely return** to stay here again. The hotel’s mix of luxurious comfort, superb location, and outstanding hospitality has won us over. We can't wait to come back!","An unforgettable experience at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r971854403-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"765","163839876","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/c3/ff/84/145piyushs.jpg","765","49","290","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145piyushs","145piyushs","F43C9B17AB2544599E5946C4A9BDEDC2",,"293860","India","India","145piyushs"

Also very special thanks should go to steward Kavinda Maddumage who I observed a beautiful genuine smile on his face always.

Shouldn't forget the two directors Thushara Bandara, Gayan Pieris., and Assistant Manager Ajith.It is really necessary for managers to be on the floor  around the clock, I've been to many leading five star properties In town and I have no hesitation to state Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo management and staff are the best

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

We’re glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay, especially our traditional Sri Lankan breakfast and the prompt poolside service. It’s also great to know that our location made it convenient for you to explore the city, beach, and nearby temples.

We appreciate your comments about the security checks on arrival — your safety and peace of mind are our top priorities. These measures are in place to ensure a secure environment for all our guests, especially during large-scale events like the Military Sports Conference.

We're sorry to hear that the pizza didn't meet your expectations, and we’ve shared your feedback with our culinary team to improve on this. Your suggestion is valuable and helps us raise our standards.

We look forward to welcoming you back should your travels bring you to Sri Lanka again.

Up after a few hours sleep and a nice welcome to traditional Sri Lankan buffett breakfast. 
The hotel itself was pretty good, I didn't have any issues. Any poolside service was pretty quick. Need to learn how to make a good pizza, the only letdown.

Situated on a stunning beach that offered a unique sense of being in the middle of sea, Jetwing Saman Villas delivered both the privacy we sought and exceptional luxury from arrival to departure. While the accommodation and food were outstanding, the highlight was the exceptional hospitality. Special recognition goes to Kavindu, Thilani, and Sashika for their attentive care, though the entire staff was remarkably kind and considerate. 

We stayed in a deluxe suite with a pool which was so much fun. Each room has a designated butler whom you can call if you need anything but we didn’t not have to use this service since everything you need was there already. The minibar was free for use for the first instance and had a reasonable range of local alcohol and fizzy drinks. The bed was very comfortable and the room had automated blinds that ensures a good sleep.

The food was delightful as well. They were made with a twist of Sri Lankan flavor and apparently most of the items are locally sourced . Hats off to chefs for creating such amazing dishes. We wanted to taste a bit of everything and the staff was so kind to accommodate.

The framed photograph and sweet box presented at check-out were a lovely and memorable gesture.

Бутик-отель jetwingsamanvillas 
объективно один из лучших на Ш��и-Ланке. Великолепная атмосфера умиротворения, покоя и гармонии. Отель расположен в роскошном тропическом лесу, среди кокосовых пальм на берегу Индийского океана. Здесь все способствует роскошному отдыху, начиная от великолепных вилл и заканчивая сервисом. Мы пожелали жить в вилле на первом этаже ближе к океану, чтобы в любую минуту можно было спускаться к океану…. Вилла великолепная, большая и уютная, с ванной под открытым небом, столиком на веранде и всем необходимым. У входа стояла чаша для обмывания ног, в которой всегда менялись свежие цветы. В номере всегда было все необходимое и каждый день свежие цветы. В любое время, по желанию, можно заказать еду в номер. Вид на океан божественный, купаться нужно осторожно, волны бывают с человеческий рост. На территории есть отличный бассейн с подсветкой и перспективой на бесконечность.  Хочется выразить особую благодарность нашему обожаемому дворецкому Janith, который отлично выполняет свою работу и превратил наше пребывание в отеле в волшебную сказку ❤️ А так же выразить благодарность всему персоналу отеля за уникальную атмосферу и отличный сервис. Немного об обслуживании…. Нас встретили с шампанским, быстро оформили и проводили в виллу на 2м этаже. Я попросила первый и ближе к океану, нас переселили в течение 15 минут. Кухня здесь что то между европейской и индийской. Завтраки очень вкусные и большие, обслуживание быстрое. У нас был включен завтрак и ужин. Обедали мы в ресторане или просили принести в номер. Обслуживание быстрое. В основном нас обслуживал наш дворецкий, он идеально выполнял все наши капризы, а мы любим покушать)) Разъяснял концепцию каждого блюда, как положено в хороших ресторанах. Так как мы долго отдыхали в этом отеле, для нас было организовано много сюрпризов, ужин у бассейна с подсветкой был незабываемый. Как то в обед нам сделали неожиданный сюрприз в виде блюда, которое я выложила на фото, с угощениями из местной кухни. А на прощание нам устроили вечер с шампанским, выложили на постеле “I will miss you “ из цветов. В день отъезда сделали с нами совместное фото и  подарили нам на память фотографии. Когда нас провожали до автомобиля, мне хотелось плакать. 
Да, еще немного о СПА салоне, первую процедуру подарили мне и моей дочери, следующие мы посетил�� платно. Мы получили массаж Аюроведа, он был великолепен! Есть с чем сравнивать, мы посещали центр Аюроведа на Бали.  
В целом, Шри-Ланка это потрясающая теплая страна, богатая красивыми, великодушными, талантливыми и улыбчивыми людьми ❤️

But this time absolutely incredible, the food was a complete game changer. beautifully presented, full of flavor, and clearly prepared with care and creativity. Every dish we had was delicious, from starters to dessert. It felt like the culinary experience had been completely elevated since our last visit, and we were so pleasantly surprised.

The staff were warm and genuinely welcoming, making us feel cared for in every way.

Nothing was too much trouble and they were full of smiles all of the time. It really made us feel welcome and valued and we had a lovely few days with them.

We were assigned a personal bus on arrival who not only looked after us at meal times and anything we needed but also looked after our room as well. He gave us a phone and we could phone him if we needed anything at all, he was one of the nicest men I’ve met and made recommendations for the food and gave us information about the place and the culture, I genuinely feel the staff here cared which is very rare in this day and age, well done to the management for stealing value into their people,","Amazing location, tranquil and relaxing hotel and about the nicest hotel staff I’ve ever met","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r1003464389-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","92","63","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gvh121","Greg","EFFA0FE96256E9B1640BEBA08DD23EDD",,"186342","Norwich, United Kingdom","Norwich","gvh121"

Thank you for taking the time to share your kind feedback. We’re truly honoured to be considered one of the highlights of your visit to Sri Lanka—it means a great deal to us.
We’re delighted to hear that you enjoyed the beauty of the beach, the comfort of your private pool, and the attentive service from our team. Cleanliness and guest satisfaction are always top priorities for us, and we’re glad you felt well cared for during your stay.
We also deeply appreciate your mention of Sri Lanka’s natural reserves. As a resort committed to sustainability and responsible tourism, we couldn’t agree more—the incredible biodiversity and protected areas of this island are true national treasures, and we fully support their preservation.
It was a pleasure having you with us, and we hope to welcome you back for another memorable escape in the near future.

The hotel is superb — from the food to the staff and all other facilities, everything was well-maintained and worth the price. I would definitely return and recommend it to others.

A few suggestions that could make the stay even better:

Checkout Time Flexibility: The staff was quite firm on the 12 noon checkout, and I felt rushed. It would be great if there was some flexibility. One more small note: the lunch buffet starts at 12:30 PM, but checkout is at 12noon , so we were left with half an hour of waiting around without much to do. Maybe this timing could be reconsidered to improve the guest experience.

Bar Location: The bar is a bit far from the pool area. Having it closer by the side of the pool would be more convenient — nothing like enjoying a cocktail while relaxing by the pool.

Friday Night Music: The DJ music on Friday night was extremely loud. I couldn’t even hear my husband speaking next to me. Since most guests come to relax, soft restaurant background music would create a much more pleasant atmosphere. We all come to enjoy dinner with the great sea breeze. Not to listen to very loud music.

Saturday Water Aerobics: While some may enjoy it, the session felt unnecessary and a bit disruptive, especially as the pool is small. A calm poolside environment would be more in line with a relaxing weekend getaway.Its disturbing to others who are not participating. 

Toilet Cleanliness: The lobby toilet smelled nice and seemed clean overall, but the toilet seat was quite dirty, which was disappointing. Also, the small plant pot inside the toilet area looked unattractive and neglected.

That said, the 4th-floor rooms offer a lovely view, and if a few of the above points are addressed, this place has all the potential to be an exceptional getaway spot. Looking forward to my 4th visit soon!","Lovely Stay with a Few Suggestions for Improvement","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r1014018154-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"555","625354088","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/25/46/25/68/prashanig.jpg","555","0","32","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrashaniG","Prashani Perera","95659E70E60066C2553F49BFE1E94487",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","PrashaniG"

The location is perfect—right by the beach with stunning views of the ocean and easy access to local shops and attractions. The rooms were clean, spacious, and well-maintained, with all the modern amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The hotel also offers a beautiful pool area and a wide variety of food options that cater to different tastes.

What made our experience truly special, however, was the exceptional service provided by Mr. Nandana. From the moment we arrived, he went above and beyond to ensure we were well taken care of. His attention to detail, friendly nature, and professionalism truly stood out. Whether it was assisting with special requests, recommending local activities, or simply checking in to make sure we were comfortable, Mr. Nandana’s hospitality made us feel genuinely welcome and valued.

Thanks to him and the wonderful team at Citrus Hikkaduwa, we left with fond memories and a strong desire to return. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Hikkaduwa!","Citrus Hikkaduwa offers a beautiful beachfront location, clean and comfortable rooms, great food, and excellent amenitie","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r1011507712-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452388198","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disheind","Dishein d","4AAC2E6164004A2C806E50F300FA3E2E",,,,,"disheind"

We booked a hotel with a lift, thinking it would go to all rooms, NO, it only goes to DELUXE rooms.
Our room was up two flights of stairs (not suitable for either myself or my Wife) the response from the staff when we raised this was that ‘it’s not their website’ but nowhere stated the superior rooms were not accessible. 
That was when the nightmare really started, this was by far and away the worst Hotel room I have been allocated in 40+ years of travelling the world. If this is their idea of superior I hate to think superior to what? 
The decoration was dated and needed a good update, however the Mini Fridge had mould and dirt across the front and inside, (see photos) the floors were dirty, the inside of the bathroom door was also covered in something and mould, rainfall shower head looked like it had never been cleaned in the 15+ years since it was put in, black mould all over the shower and bathroom. 
Unsurprisingly, I went back to reception to complain and the Duty manager came out and agreed that the room was not of the standard that they would want to supply, he couldn’t move us to a Deluxe room but “May be able to tomorrow” at an additional charge of £20 per night for the remaining 12 nights of our Holiday.
We were shown a different room which was down one flight of stairs, so still not accessible. The facilities were the same as the previous room, they were marginally cleaner but the shower was filthy and mouldy. So much so that even after 20 hours travelling I wasn’t prepared to have a shower in the room. The sheets also had dirty marks on them (we didn’t notice until later as it was late at night and we’d been travelling nearly 24 hours at this point). We agreed to stay in the room for that night on the understanding that we would be leaving the next day unless they could come up with a suitable room. 
The “all-inclusive” restaurant is actually a “some inclusive”, Coke is, but Coke Zero isn’t, different meals are and aren’t, and the quality is poor. Breakfast was no better.
When we were at Breakfast we saw the Duty Manager but he didn’t come to talk to us. After Breakfast we decided that we needed to find a different hotel, so we went on a tour of the other hotels in the area and found somewhere better to stay.
When we checked out, the Duty Manager finally offered us an upgrade to a Deluxe room and showed me around 3 rooms which although they were better and cleaner- hard not to be- they still had black mould in the showers. Their surprise that we still wanted to leave, after their disinterest and poor customer service meant for me it was just too little too late. We checked out and because we hadn’t accepted the offered ‘upgrade’ we received no refund. 
This is the first bad review I have ever written about a trip ever, normally if things aren't quite what I was hoping for, I can accept different standards for different people.","Please believe the reviews about this Hotel!

The whole place was exceptionally clean.  The room cleaner was a master of towel creations and he really made us giggle.

We had a super friendly and attentive restaurant waiter/barman called Sanjeewa who was lovely and we very much enjoyed his company, but quite honestly EVERYONE single member of the staff there bent over backwards to help us and to chat with us.

Yes - there was a lot of curry on the menu…. It is only to be expected.
We wanted burger and chips once or twice - which was available on the room service menu.   It was delicious.   We don’t eat Fish ourselves but the food that a group ordered from the A La Carte menu went out and I was really impressed with it!!  The staff were so chuffed with how it looked too - there was almost a parade as servers and chefs presented it proudly to the guests .,. It was lovely to see.

I made my booking through Agoda (Booking ID: 1605562865) for a Deluxe Room with Full Board (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The confirmation email I received from Agoda clearly stated that all three meals were included. I even have screenshots from Agoda showing the pricing breakdown:

LKR 18,123 – Bed & Breakfast

LKR 22,182 – Bed & Breakfast

LKR 23,417 – Dinner & Breakfast

LKR 26,095 – Full Board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

I obviously selected the Full Board option and paid accordingly. But when I arrived at the hotel at around 1:45 PM, I was told by the reception that meals weren’t included. I showed them the official confirmation from Agoda, and unbelievably, they responded by saying, “Those are the benefits you can get if you pay extra.”

Absolutely ridiculous.

After keeping me waiting until 2:30 PM just to check in, they refused to offer what I paid for and told me to contact Agoda myself — completely washing their hands off the issue. If you’re listed on Agoda, you should know how to handle booking issues with your partner. That’s basic hospitality. Instead, the reception staff showed no professionalism, no empathy, and no problem-solving ability whatsoever. They were also rude and dismissive, showing zero understanding of what customer service means.

Later I had to follow up with Agoda, and both Agoda and Citrus started bouncing the blame back and forth. Citrus claimed they received the booking via Expedia, not Agoda, which I as the end customer, do not care about. I booked through Agoda. I received a full board confirmation through Agoda. That’s the end of the story for me. Their Reservations Manager, Upendra, sent excuse after excuse, repeatedly saying “we didn’t get the booking from Agoda”. Then who took my money? Who sent me the confirmation? Why are you even listed on Agoda if you can’t handle a booking through it?

It’s funny (and tragic) how this hotel boasts about being a top brand in Sri Lanka with the following mission and vision on their website:

Vision: “To be the ultimate hospitality brand in Sri Lanka.”
Mission: “To deliver exceptional hospitality by going beyond the call of duty and extending personalized, friendly and professional service at every given opportunity.”

These statements are laughable considering the treatment I received.

The only saving grace during my stay was the restaurant staff at SALT, who were genuinely kind, respectful, and professional — unlike the rest of the hotel staff who clearly need hospitality training from scratch.

To the hotel’s Director of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Mani Sugathapala, perhaps you could use this review as a negative marketing case study. You can reach out to me if you’d like a detailed breakdown of how your brand failed at every possible touchpoint.

This hotel doesn’t deserve even 3 stars, let alone the inflated ratings it shows online. I had higher expectations when I booked, and now I just feel cheated and disappointed. You ruined my vacation.

I’ll be sharing this review on Agoda, Google, TripAdvisor, and social media platforms to help others avoid this nightmare.","Absolutely the Worst Hotel Experience I’ve Had – DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r1005833137-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389307","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg","1200","0","6","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tharindur787","Tharindu Rajapaksha","3E811B39C3632A868886E43234017C0B",,"304138","Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kandy","tharindur787"

Отдыхали в вашем отели Цитрус Хиккадува с 23.04.25 по 02.05.25 я мама с двумя детьми. С нами произошла ужасная ситуация. В ночь на 30.04 -01.05 у нас из номера из сумки украли 200 долларов. Залезли ночью когда мы спали, в номер через наш открытый балкон, одного из не заселенного  номера (в эту ночь свободны были оба номера, со слов вашего менеджера) Деньги лежали в сумке всегда и я их носила с собой везде (в барах, кафе, пляж, массаж) и всегда они оставались при мне - эти деньги предназначались на сувениры для детей в последний день отъезда. Но не в ту ночь! 01.05 - мы провели в отели. И по факту, около 15 часов (когда мы хотели собраться за сувенирами) я обнаружила что их нет в сумке. Обратившись на ресепшен и сообщив про этот вопиющий случай, менеджер в открытую над нами смеялся и издевался то что мы ничего не докажем и то что мы сами виноваты тк не хранили деньги в сейфе. НО повторюсь это произошло ночью когда мы были в номере и спали. И это уже умышленное проникновение. Наша безопастность под угрозой.
Со стороны главного персонала хотя бы необходимо было услышать сочувствие и хотя бы попытки уладить данную ситуации. Но ее не последовало. В это утро к нам 2 раза без видимой ��ричины (уже после уборки) заходил убирающий персонал. Что он хотел? что проверял? такого не было никогда за все время проживания. Это очень странно. Так же менеджер не сообщил нам и не дал пообщаться с горничным и не инициировал даже возможность просмотра хоть каких то камер. Нам пришлось поехать в полицию, и они параллельно с нами приехали в отель, мы объясняли им что произошло и с их стороны было понимание они пытались компенсировать хотя бы нам презент в закрытие 22000 рупий по счету в отеле. Но менеджер на сингальском языке пытался все переиначить и выставить нас дураками. Он даже угрожал моему сыну что либо мы заплатим либо у нас будут проблемы! Мы расстроены и разочарованы и уверены что данный менеджер в эту ночь устроил эту аферу с кражей в номере. Он не был заинтересован в расследование этого происшествия. И да, мы делаем вывод что это все с его разрешения и с его инициирования.
Первоначально у нас был забронирован в вашем отеле номер на 5 ночей(через Агода) но нам у вас понравилось что мы продлили ещё проживание на 4 ночи( Expedia). И это было роковой ошибкой. Сейчас мы боимся и предупреждаем ваших гостей о том что в отеле Цитрус , менеджер устраивает кражи из номеров и там опасно спать в ночное время. Если что то случится менеджер не будет участвовать в расследовании произошедшего. И даже искренне по-человечески не посочувствует.
В данный отель мы приехали по рекомендации наших друзей которые очень часто останавливались у вас. Пожалуйста примите меры в расследовании этой вопиющей ситуации. Я искренне верю что ваши гости достойны на отдыхе быть защищенными. Потому что за время поездки по Шри-Ланке мы встретили много добрых и классных людей. Огромный привет Дама который поддерживал словом и всегда было приятно с ним поговорить в отеле. Огромные привет официантам все они супер! Их улыбки приятны и искренны. Тукер у отеля - колоритный и очень весёлый! Обязательно приедем в это чудесную страну ещё раз и хотели бы в цитрус , но без этого злобного воришки менеджера. Мне не так жаль 200 долларов, мне жаль что ваш менеджер позорит честь вашего отеля и кому то из людей может показаться что в этой стране очень опасно из за таких как он. Он позор!","Воруют в отеле","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r1005818860-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389795","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps46944611171","Maps46944611171","A6DC2B2FAF09F083B46C34148E79BA19",,,,,"Maps46944611171"

We were a group of 11.  Aliya Resort is a sprawling estate that provides all of your needs and wants without being intrusive.  The property has a large capacity, but you never feel overcrowded or neglected by staff.   The food is amazing - fresh and plenty of selection. Staff attentiveness is second to none - from housekeeping, spa, pool service, reception and of course the incredible waitstaff and bar staff.  I would love to name every single staff member but.  There are two standouts, which I know had their team members supporting them as well.  Supun, one of the head waiters was fun, friendly, professional and attentive.  His humour was well received by our group - along with his team in the bar.  Isuru was also a stand out.  His personal service to our small group at one of our dinners was exceptional.  He was polite, friendly and informative.  He also was supported by other staff, but the group loved him as well.  Thank you to all staff that looked after us.

From the inception, it gave a different perspective.
The hotel security staff guided us correctly to our parking spots in an orderly manner & guided us correctly to the vast property.

Staff were courtier and did the checking in /out fast. Guided us to our rooms. Good job.
House Keeping:
Staff were professional and attended to all our requirements. Good professional work.
F & B:
Staff was good & the spread was large,  but the taste of the food has to be improved… 
In the morning breakfast certain items in continental / English breakfast were not available in the spread. When inquired the answer given was not suited for a five star property (but later on the requested item was provided). Good attempt…

From the front desk to housekeeping to restaurant service – every member of staff made us feel genuinely welcome and well taken care of.

A special thank you to the lovely receptionist who greeted us so warmly, and especially to Ricky, the Hotel Manager – truly outstanding. He was present, approachable, and ensured everything ran smoothly throughout our stay.

Honestly, I’ve never experienced this level of hospitality, service, and attention to detail – not even in many top hotels across Europe. Cinnamon Life has set a new personal benchmark.

The room, the view, the food, the atmosphere – all easily a 10/10.
I can wholeheartedly recommend Cinnamon Life and will definitely return on my next trip to Colombo.

Thank you for taking the time to share your reflections on your visit to Cinnamon Life. We’re delighted that the interior décor, artistic displays, and thoughtfully designed spaces left such a strong impression on you.

Our goal has always been to create more than just a hotel—but a destination where architecture, design, and experience come together. We're especially pleased you enjoyed the ambience of the vertical garden and water wall, as well as the spectacular night views from the Dreams and Beats terrace.

We hope your next visit gives you even more time to explore and enjoy all that Cinnamon Life has to offer.

Thank you for your thoughtful and beautifully detailed review. We’re delighted to know that your experience at Cinnamon Life was both memorable and enjoyable.

It’s truly heartening to hear that our high-tech comforts and modern luxuries enhanced your stay, and that the warmth of our team left a lasting impression.

We also appreciate your constructive feedback regarding the check-in process. Your observation is well noted, and we will take steps to ensure our front office colleagues are more comprehensive in their welcome briefings moving forward.

The staff were extremely friendly and always greeted us with warm, beautiful smiles. It truly made us feel welcome.
However, one small suggestion – the front office staff could improve a bit by providing more information during check-in, especially about the hotel facilities and in-room amenities.

The buffet was excellent, with a wide variety of tasty dishes. We especially enjoyed the Sri Lankan traditional sweets – compliments to the chefs!

We also tried in-room dining, and it was an outstanding experience. The person who answered the call was very professional, and the food was delivered promptly. The staff who brought the food was knowledgeable and polite.
Special thanks and high recommendations to Kushan and Sandun from the in-room dining team – great service!

Housekeeping also did a fantastic job. The room was always clean, fresh, and well-maintained. A big thank you to the housekeeping team for their great care.

When we called to make the reservation, we clearly asked Mr. Deen (the manager at Long Feng) several times whether our vouchers and promotions would be valid for the “All You Can Eat Dim Sum.” He confirmed multiple times over the phone that they were valid. Based on his confirmation we proceeded to make our reservation and visit the restaurant.
However, after our meal, we were informed that the vouchers were in fact not applicable. This directly contradicts everything Mr. Deen told us earlier. This is not just a simple mistake — it’s a complete failure in communication and accountability on the part of someone who is supposed to be in a position of responsibility. If he wasn’t 100% sure, the bare minimum he should have done was to double-check before giving us a definite answer. Instead, he gave us false information with complete confidence, which led to an embarrassing and frustrating situation for us as customers.
Frankly, it’s unacceptable for a manager at a five-star hotel to behave in such an incompetent and careless manner. Guests rely on your managers to provide correct details about promotions etc. 
I sincerely hope you take this seriously and ensure that issues like this are addressed — both in terms of accountability for Mr. Deen’s actions, and making sure such miscommunication doesn’t happen to other guests. This kind of service is simply not acceptable from a hotel of your reputation.","Misinformation from Long Feng manager Mr.Deen","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d456049-r1010952153-Cinnamon_Lakeside_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"678","683945149","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/c4/2c/bd/sophisticatedpalate1.jpg","678","2","39","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophisticatedpalate1","sophisticated.palate","1BD7A6D7A91F2AD208D5952F02BCF8C3",,"293962","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Colombo","sophisticatedpalate1"

The breakfast was a highlight, offering a good variety of dishes, including vegetarian options, which was perfect for our group. 

The hotel's location is convenient, just about 1 to 1.5 km from Pannai Beach, making it an easy and pleasant walk for an evening stroll or to enjoy the scenic views.

Overall, Jetwing Jaffna delivered a great blend of comfort, good food, and accessibility, making it a fantastic choice for families or groups visiting Jaffna. Would definitely recommend!

Thank you for sharing your valuable feedback. We’re glad to hear that you appreciated our prime location, comfortable rooms, and the scenic views from your balcony. It’s also wonderful to know that our associate at reception made a positive impression with his helpfulness. Jetwing Jaffna is designed as a city hotel, offering convenience and modern comforts in the heart of the peninsula. However, we appreciate your observations on areas where we can enhance the guest experience. Your insights on service, maintenance, and our rooftop space are valuable, and we will certainly look into how we can refine these aspects. We truly appreciate your recognition of Jetwing’s standards, and your comments motivate us to continue improving. While I thank you for sharing your thoughts, I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome you back to our humble home in the north.

There's a lovely view from the balcony over the Library and Town Hall towards the sea. Breakfast was decent. But this isn't one of Jetwing's special hotels, in terms of ambience or service. It is a functional and perfectly alright city hotel, but no real charm or character. The service was mostly pretty average (at best), with only a few exceptions  - a shoutout for the young man on reception who directed me to St. James' Church, Nallur for a funeral, who was super helpful and proactive. We had no hot water on the first night in any of the three rooms we occupied. Nothing was done about this, despite repeated requests. Various fixtures and fittings in the room were broken, and it was really difficult to get these fixed. Many of the staff didn't speak English (including some of those on reception!), so dodged any interaction with foreign guests (we were a mixed SL/international group), and avoided responding to requests or questions. There's a rooftop with potentially great views, but no effort to create a tasteful space or to make the most of it. Jetwing ... you're a good hotel chain, with an enviable record elsewhere ... but I think you need to up your game on this hotel. It could be so much better.","Absolutely OK, but a bit average","2025-02","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d9566109-r996331432-Jetwing_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",,"1790","101492434","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/0c/a6/d2/frequenttraveller63.jpg","1536","328","240","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frequenttraveller63","frequenttraveller63","ACE1F10CC74EB4C94DB54596214DDCC3",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","frequenttraveller63"

Given the high price, the experience did not meet our expectations.

Firstly..we did not receive the welcome drink that was supposed to be offered. Additionally, there was no assistance with luggage management, making our check-out quite inconvenient.

A major issue arose with our takeaway breakfast. Since we were exploring Jaffna, we had specifically ordered two pure vegetarian and two non veg breakfasts. However the vegetarian packs contained eggs and cake, which was unacceptable as we are strictly vegetarian. This left us starving and highly disappointed. Even on other days, the buffet spread was very limited.

Having stayed at four different resorts within the same hotel chain, this was by far the worst experience. We hope the management takes these concerns seriously and improves the service for future guests.","Disappointing Experience at Jetwing Jaffna","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304135-d9566109-r992681766-Jetwing_Jaffna-Jaffna_Northern_Province.html",,"1200","452391234","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madhushanip2023","Madhushani P","AB54F1FDC6318132EE429B523AEF99CB",,,,,"madhushanip2023"

Dear Shangri-La Colombo Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction regarding an incident that occurred during a banquet function on March 29, 2025, involving your kitchen staff member, Piyumi.

During the event, I observed that Ms. Piyumi was unprofessional in her interactions with guests. Specifically, there was a moment when she appeared to argue with a guest rather than assisting them with their needs. Furthermore, I witnessed her engaging in behavior that was not in line with the hospitality standards expected at Shangri-La. 

Additionally, I noticed that she appeared to be consuming a drink while on duty, which is concerning for a staff member working at a guest-facing event. This behavior not only reflects poorly on the standards of your establishment but also potentially affects the experience of your guests.

I believe that proper training and adherence to professional conduct are crucial for maintaining the high standards that Shangri-La is known for. I hope that this feedback will be taken seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that all staff members uphold the values of hospitality that your hotel represents.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Since 2021, it has been our go-to location for business catchups and my mum’s favourite lounge whenever we are in Sri Lanka.

However, my last two visits, in January and June of last year were quite disappointing. The service was noticeably slower, and the staff no longer carried the same friendly, attentive attitude that once set this place apart. What was even more disheartening was the sense that service now seems divided  with locals often receiving less favourable treatment.

Hospitality and service excellence should not be based on appearance or assumptions about where someone comes from. Every guest, whether local or foreign, deserves to feel equally welcomed and valued. After all, locals also contribute significantly to the success of a business.

Although I am not a local myself, I still felt that the spirit of excellence this place was once known for has sadly faded. I truly hope to see the standard of service return to what it used to be  inclusive, warm, and exceptional.","Sapphire Lounge","2024-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12720953-r1001193457-Shangri_La_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"510","725375320","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/3c/59/58/amyamy18.jpg","510","1","18","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amyamy18","Ash","5F197CFCF7278E5A1E487A3F2B1F556A",,"186388","Surrey, United Kingdom","Surrey","Amyamy18"

Impeccable. Infallible. Flawless.

They will go that one step more to surprise and please you e.g. anniversary, birthdays etc. Balloons and cakes etc. I was certainly taken aback as I entered my room. 

Breakfast is well worth the price. You will be spoilt for choice. What a variety of food! 

Concierge - especially Janaka, are the best to make the most of your trip in Sri Lanka. 

Hotel are very flexible with regards to late check out, as ALL hotels should be.  NOTE, all hotels of the world!. I say this because not all airlines can land at a time conducive to hotel times. 

A great mall linked to the hotel is very handy when it comes to shopping, dining, souvenirs etc. 

Free Tuk-TuK service...drops you off anywhere within a 2km radius. Very handy.

The room was just spacious enough for 2 people. It had all the amenities we required but you could hear music from the ground floor (as our room was situated on the lower floors). Nice view from my room of the lake and the hotels nearby. 

The staff were friendly enough and helped us when we need them. Conveniently, the hotel is connected to the mall, so it’s another way to enter the hotel. Understandably security is a constant aspect of the hotel but once you get to know the people, its painless. 

The breakfast was fantastic at his hotel with lots of options. The seating was no issue, so we never had to worry about getting a seat. Whilst we were there, many events took place at the hotel (wedding & bank events) so it can get a bit busy.

I had issues getting an uber from the hotel as the hotel has 2 entrances (I believe). The staff tried to help but it came to no avail. I think the security can scare of some of the scooter drivers, so you are best of walking to the front of the mall to get them.

The main tourist sites are not really close by, but I would say that the hotel is situated in the middle, with the sites north and south of it.","Top quality hotel with great room view and breakfast","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12720953-r996428183-Shangri_La_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,"3264","316326559","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/da/c2/9f/firoz-u.jpg","2448","67","652","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firozu2018","Firoz U","20294382630F1CC0D19F98406B157940",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","firozu2018"

Welcome drink and neck massage offered while checking in, exceptional 6-course tasting menu at the restaurant, breakfast served in the garden, cozy SPA with heated pool, steam bath & sauna, park with wonderful view over the valley.

The food, probably the best we have had in Sri Lanka was akin to a Michelin star restaurant. 
We were greeted with a 6 course meal on our first night.

A hotel with bungalows in the superb gardens surrounded by jungle. We stayed for a week in one of the garden bungalows, which was great. From the seating area just outside the bungalow, the jungle is literally yards away and monkeys can be heard and seen swinging through the trees. The bungalows have one main room with a bed, aircon and a fridge, a toilet with basin, a separate shower, and one main bedroom. It was pretty rustic - the shower was cold - but climate is so hot that isn't an issue. We had breakfast with other guests, on the terrace of the house/hotel which was really good. Mirissa Beach - which was wonderful - was a short 300SLR tuktuk drive away. There are loads of restaurants on the beaches serving excellent and very reasonably priced food.

Just to clarify for future guests the actual ""boggy jungle "" is dry for 10 months of the year & is only a 10 second stretch, the walk from the main house through the property to the villa takes 3 minutes through the back garden, jungle & a paved road. 
We can only apologize for the stray dogs but unfortunately it is a fact of life in Sri Lanka & there is not much that we can do about it - we do support dog charities that do sterilisation programs but it is a nationwide problem. We do have a night watchman who is available to escort you home of a night time, I am sorry that this was not pointed out to you during your arrival welcome. I have impressed on the Manager the importance of this. Likewise we do also have tuk tuks that we use who we can call to pick up or drop you at the villa if you do not want to walk the garden route.
We can also only apologize for the lack of street lights in this country.
Once again thank you for raising some points which I have passed on to the relevant people.

The main villa also looks lovely. However, we wanted to flag a few pointers (especially with solo travellers in mind) for future guests. 

We were put in the second villa - not the main spice house. To reach this you either need to walk through a boggy jungle for five minutes or through a side alley filled with guard dogs and strays. This is fine in the day, but pitch black at night and pretty frightening. 

One evening at around 10pm we walked home through the side alley (the recommended path from the owners) to be met by four snarling dogs. We felt threatened and turned back to the main street to try the second entrance to the property. There was then someone available to guide us home with a torch through the jungle route. On our next evening we arrived back later and walked through the jungle alone with phone torches as no one was at the property to guide us. It’s not what you want when simply trying to get home, and we’d worry for someone doing this alone. 

We both have dogs and are comfortable around strays, but even one of the workers when we flagged this story the next morning admitted that some of these dogs can be aggressive and that he has thrown stones at them before to keep them at bay.. 

During the night we were kept up by very loud dog fights down the alleys where the villa is located. In the morning (from 8am) we were woken by loud construction works on a new property adjacent to where we were staying. 

The reviews are so glowing on here for those staying in the main property, but as guests in the second villa we left feeling a bit disappointed.

To address your negative points we do have solar hot water in all  the bathrooms but unfortunately during your stay there was a lot of rain so unfortunately the water didnt always have time to heat up. If you had let us know we could have used the electric hot water system during that time. We are sorry that this was not noticed by the staff.
We do have umbrellas but during monsoon times we cannot replace them quickly enough as unfortunately guests do not always return them after borrowing them.
We have only ever accepted cash or bank transfers for payments this has not changed.
Im sorry but you have exaggerated the distance from the villa to the main house, it is a 3 minute walk through the garden & jungle, 5 minutes along the road or during rainy times if you let us know we can send a tuk tuk to collect you.

However, no hot water in the shower each morning, and no umbrellas available to walk to breakfast (10 min walk to house from the villa or tuk tuk ride).

Das Haus ist im Kolonialstil eingerichtet. Sehr verspielt, in jeder Ecke und in jedem Winkel ist etwas zu finden. Der Besitzer ist Engländer und seine Frau kommt aus Sri Lanka. Beide sind sehr freundlich und liebenswert. Das Frühstück wird mit Blick auf den Pool serviert. Vom Pool aus kann man Streifenhörnchen und Affen beobachten. Es ist sehr zentral und dennoch ruhig abgelegen. Mit dem Tuk Tuk sind es keine 5 Minuten bis zum Dreambeach. Der Turtle Beach liegt direkt 100 m vom Hotel entfernt.

Unsere Zimmer, hiessen Cinemon und Tamarinde. Cinemon war riesig., Es lohnt sich sogar die Zeit hier im Hotel zu verbringen. Das Zimmer war mit Balkon und außenmöbel ausgestattet.

Eine absolute Weiterempfehlung. Wir sind froh, in diesem Hotel übernachtet zu haben. 

Gleichzeitig unterstützen die beiden ein soziales Projekt. Sie sammeln Geld und Kleidung für arme Menschen hier im Land.

Breakfast provided a good selection of dishes with slight changes every other day, keeping it fresh and enjoyable. We also had dinner on the rooftop one evening, and while the rain disrupted the ambiance a bit, the food was excellent.  

The staff deserves a special mention for being incredibly accommodating and attentive, always ready to assist with any requests. The hotel's central location was another highlight, making it easy for us to explore nearby attractions, dining options, and shopping spots.

Номер на 6 этаже (в лифте это 4 этаж) Deluxe room. Это самая дорогая категория номеров.
Номер: 
В номере балкон с видом на океан, сейф, холодильник (маленький), кондиционер, есть Wi-Fi, не быстрый, но работает и в номере и на территории. Сначала принесли только 3 полотенца: одно на пол и 2 больших. Потом, по мере оставления на кровати 100 рупий и двух маленьких шоколадок Аленка, количество полотенец резко увеличилось). В номере чайник, 2 стакана, 2 чашки для кофе/чая и одна чайная ложка. Тарелочек нет ни одной. Всего 3 розетки на номер. Нам было маловато, так как 2 ноутбука, телефоны, часы, но приспособились). Ванная с просторной душевой кабиной немного уставшая, предполагаю, что из за влажности. Душевая лейка не снимается. Кровать отличная, подушки так же. Постельное белье не идеальное, один раз были небольшие дырочки, другой раз пятнышко не большое. Кондиционер охлаждал хорошо, но и шумел тоже хорошо! Вход в номер с общего открытого балкона, который обращен к улице и дороге. А по этой улице гоняют местные колоритные Крейзи Басы и тук туки и сигналят постоянно. А еще есть железнодорожная ветка параллельно дороге и поезда тоже регулярно оповещают местных жителей и гостей страны о своем присутствии регулярными гудками. Мы вообще были в шоке первое время: постоянный шум от дороги и поездов, от океана, от кондиционера! Причем спасибо кондицион��ру, он хотя бы стоим гулом заглушал немного отдельные резкие звуки с дороги. 
Территория:
Небольшая, не сказать, что идеально чистая, но из за песка, который начинается буквально в нескольких метрах от бассейна, чистоту поддерживать не просто. Шиканые деревья с плотной кроной отлично закрывают лежаки от солнышка рядом с бассейном. Лежаки деревянные, есть матрасики (некоторые требуют замены), большие полотенца, но некоторые старенькие и с пятнами. Вода в бассейне очень теплая, нагревается за день. Мутная немного. Есть бар с напитками.                                Не приветсвуется приносить свое (напитки, еда, фрукты) на бассейн. Но никто замечаний не делал, хотя некоторые компании прям пикники устраивали, что на мой взгляд не совсем правильно…
Завтраки:
Хорошая столовая, чистая, выбор блюд для Шри-Ланки хороший. Помидорки, огурцы, порезанные кубиками, листья салата, один вид сыра и что то типа колбасы, 2 вида сосисок, несколько горячих блюд, станция с местной едой (4-5 видов), станция для приготовления яиц, 2 вида йогурта (один называется курд), масло, джемы, хлеб, сладкая выпечка, 3 вида сока в диспенсере, чай, кофе (не вкусный). Завтраками довольны.
Экскурсии:
Ездили в Эллу индивидуальным туром на легковом автомобиле с гидом, контакты которого нашла в отзывах об отеле: зовут Прасаду +94784700761. Забрал нас в 3 утра, вел машину другой парень, очень уверенно и безопасно, что порадовало. Пока ехали по платной дороге успели немного подремать, а когда серпантин начался, уже было сложно поспать…) Были первыми на поезде, на котором все делают фото, да и по всем остальным локациям тоже были или первыми или одними из первых. Очень понравилась организация. Все быстро и не напряжно. Прасаду везде предлагал сделать фото. Стоимость такого тура 225 долларов. Вернулись в отель примерно в 14-00, так как мы не тратили много времени на фото и прочее.
Питание:
Обедали и ужинали в кафе TREE TOP, которое находится практически напротив отеля, через дорогу. Все, что брали, было вкусно. Приносили быстро. Надо быть готовым к тому, что скатерти на столах с пятнами, интерьер простой. Частично фото меню добавила к отзыву. Совет: почитайте в интернете, как есть местные блюда). Много полезного узнаете и уважение местных Вам обеспечено!
Общение: 
Когда здороваешься на их языке ��ли благодаришь, всегда очень рады! «Аленку» очень любят, прям как дети рады всегда.
Океан:
Здесь нужно быть очень аккуратным, так как большие волны. Нужно выбирать место, где глубина достаточно близко от берега, тогда волна не такая опасная. Приведу пример про нас: мы пошли купаться, где была широкая полоса мелководья. Прошли к глубине достаточно безопасно, покупались там, на волнах покачались, а когда пошли к берегу, нас догнала волна… Не могу описать в деталях, но это было страшно… Когда тебя, как соломинку, крутит, вертит, потом удар о дно, нам повезло, ничего не сломали, но удар был такой силы, что у меня крестец до сих пор болит… 2 недели прошло!
Флора и фауна:
Здесь, конечно, все пышет!) Климат очень хороший для роста растений: влажно и тепло. Сочная буйная зелень практически везде. Черепахи, которые приплывают покормиться из рук людей, вараны, которые спокойно переходят автомобильные дороги и копают какие то ямки прям на территории отеля, десятки морских ежей, которые сидят практически ковром по поверхности мертвых кораллов, мурены, живущие там же в кораллах, разнообразные рыбки… Можно наблюдать часами!

We stayed in a deluxe sea view room on the 3rd floor. From the minute of our arrival we felt very welcome. We were greeted with a refreshing drink and didn’t have long to wait for our rooms. The hotel is in a beautiful setting on the beach and with plenty of bars and restaurants outside on the road in both directions.
We stayed on an all inclusive basis and found the food very good with plenty of choice. We did eat out nearby also on occasion.
Yes the hotel could do with a little updating in particular the rooms and pool. However there were works being carried out whilst we were there and I believe they were closing in April to carry out more. Saying this however everywhere was miticulously clean. Only issue we found with our room was storage. There was a lovely wardrobe area, but the room could do with some drawers. There wasn’t many coat hangars but we just asked our room boy and he got us more.
The staff at this hotel really make it. Every one of them with a smile on their face and very helpful. They make it 5 stars! Three of the staff in particular made our holiday. Nuwan who within minutes of our arrival spoke to management in order for me to have coke zero (I am diabetic) included in our all inclusive (as it isn’t normally) which was above and beyond. He also looked after us on many occasions in the restaurant. Also Chinthaka and Sanjeewa who again looked after us, always having a table ready for us every meal time. All were a pleasure and we had some great chats with them. They are a credit to the hotel. Our room boy (can’t remember his name) left our room clean and with great towel art every day, thank you.
Also a special mention to management, who on Independence Day made us feel so included in your celebrations. We really enjoyed it, especially the tea 😊. A big thank you to you all and your staff.
Would I stay again? Without a doubt.

From the moment they arrived, the hospitality was exceptional—starting with the front office, where the staff provided a warm welcome. The food was excellent, the service was seamless, and the entire team carried out their duties with professionalism and dedication.

A particular incident during the visit highlighted the honesty and integrity of the hotel staff. One of our Japanese business partners had unknowingly left behind a valuable laptop. The hotel staff promptly contacted them, ensuring its safe return. This act of honesty deeply impressed our foreign guests, as they were amazed by the sincerity and ethical values upheld by the Sri Lankan staff.

Mr. Saman Jayasooriya and his team expressed their gratitude, especially towards the front office manager, Mr. Sampath, who played a key role in providing exceptional service. Our Japanese partners repeatedly mentioned how this experience strengthened their admiration for Sri Lankan hospitality and professionalism.

Given the remarkable service and integrity displayed, I would confidently give this hotel a 100% rating.

The room quality was poor far below my expectations for a reputed hotel. Having stayed at Hikka Tranz several times, I had hoped that Citrus would at least be a decent alternative. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

The room we received was extremely basic and lacked essential amenities, except for shampoo and body wash in the bathroom. To make matters worse, the toilet wall had visible fungus, which was both shocking and disgusting for a hotel of this reputation. Even the swimming pool was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We genuinely felt that the experience was not worth the money we paid.

In the morning, as we stepped out of our room, we were greeted by a plate of leftover food on the floor. Additionally, a broken bed and mattress were left in the hallway. Even the framed pictures on the walls had mold growing inside them. It was disheartening to see that no effort had been made to maintain or improve the hotel's quality. When we inquired about this, the staff mentioned that renovations were planned for April, but this still did not justify the current condition of the hotel.

The only redeeming factor of our stay was the staff they were wonderful! They ensured that we had a pleasant experience wherever possible, and even at the restaurant, they served us with warm smiles.

I sincerely hope that the hotel management takes immediate action to refurbish the hotel and improve its standards. Otherwise, guests will soon realize that the pictures shared online do not reflect the reality on the ground.","A disappointment","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r991830289-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"640","102605273","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/1d/a1/d9/tharindukande.jpg","960","68","255","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TharinduKande","Tharindu K","26B250ADF4614F393914DE097AFCF89F",,"304138","Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kandy","TharinduKande"

Приехали после 14:00, поэтому заселили сразу. 

В номере: сначала нам дали номера, которые выходят на улицу и без балкона. У меня в номере не было сейфа, который по моей просьбе принесли в течение часа. На следующий день нам заменили номера на другие (те, которые и должны быть), с балконом и видом на бушующий океан. 

В ванной - тропический душ, лейка не снимается; есть гель для душа, шампунь, мыло; регулярно пополняются. 

В номере чисто, на полу плитка. 

Хочу добавить, что как в первом, так и во втором номерах сделан ремонт. 

Есть сушилка для вещей. Лайфхак: чтобы вещи сохли побыстрее, можно поставить сушилку под зону обдува кондиционера. В этом плане, кстати, балкон не сильно поможет (вещи сохнут больше суток - особенности климата), поэтому если номер без балкона, можно сильно не переживать. Вообще рекомендую  брать с собой по два или даже три комплекта купальников, чтобы ходить на пляж хотя бы в полусухой одежде.

Удивлена маленькому количеству отзывов о питании. У нас был ол инклюзив, о чём мы ни разу не пожалели: кормят очень вкусно, искать еду по улицам и экспериментировать не надо. 
Есть рыба, курица, свинина, говядина, баранина;  ежедневно подают креветок и другие морепродукты. Множество овощей в различных вариантах приготовления. Паста (Noodle). Есть блюда с остринкой (при том, что я не любитель острой пищи), но их от силы 30% от всей еды, при этом так вкусно, что остринка кажется приятной изюминкой. Ребёнка покормить всегда найдётся чем.  Супы ежедневно разные - тайский, из морепродуктов, сюп-пюре из кукурузы, грибной и т.д. 
Завтрак стандартный - каша, омлеты, тосты, блинчики, фрукты, сосиски, выпечка, фреш (один день - один вид, помимо соков). 
Из фруктов: арбуз, папайя, гуава, мини-бананы. 
Понравилось, кстати, что десерты очень вкусные и маленькие по размеру, можно взять на пробу несколько и не умереть от обжорства. 
За девять дней отдыха ни у кого из нас не случилось кишечного расстройства, чему я несказанно рада.

В баре подают вкусные коктейли. В ол инклюзив напитки с 10:00 до 23:00.

Хочу похвалить официантов в ресторанах, быстро всё уносят, приносят напитки, внимательные, очень вежливые. 

Wi-Fi ловит на всей территории отеля.

Попали на дождливую неделю, и когда вечером в дождь хотели посидеть на улице под зонтиком, один из официантов это заметил и настойчиво позвал нас сидеть в зале ресторана.
Если вечером кто-то хочет сесть на улице, а стулья мокрые, также подходит официант и протирает стол и стулья.

Уборка - очень хорошо, чистенько.
Если ставила табличку ""не беспокоить"",  оставляют две бутылки воды возле двери. 
Однажды постучались для уборки, я попросила подойти попозже, и реально подошли! А не как в египетских отелях - не успел, до свиданья😃

Ребёнок купалась в бассейне, начался ливень, мы стали выходить, нам тут же подал полотенце мужчина, который их выдаёт - очень приятно.

Очень любят шоколад и особенно Алёнку, берите с собой.

Вообще в целом хочу отметить персонал отеля - все очень доброжелательные, человечные, всегда могут помочь, если есть какие-то вопросы, быстро реагируют на просьбы. 

Пляж. Возле самого отеля купаться нельзя. 
Если по пляжу свернуть налево и пройти 3-4 минуты - будут большие волны, красиво, но купаться можно только уверенным в своих силах взрослым. Будьте осторожны, волны могут утянуть в океан.
Направо -  5-6 минут ходьбы за руку с 4летним ребёнком (засекали) - и вы на пляже черепах, там волн практически нет. 

Выезд. У нас был выезд в 4:00 утра, на рецепшн нам предложили заранее и позже выдали хороший сухой паёк. 

Ещё момент: в период проживания в отеле за полученные напитки нужно обязательно расписаться. Если у вас ол инклюзив, дополнительно вы их естественно не оплачиваете, это внутренняя отчётность. Однако внимательно читайте всё, за что расписываетесь - по выезду из отеля мне выписали чек на 850 рупий за платную Кока-Колу, которую я не брала. Поскольку чека за колу с моей подписью не нашли, ничего оплачивать не пришлось, но было немного неприятно.

Итого: на мой взгляд, несмотря на некоторые моменты, этот отель - лучший вариант в Хиккадуве по соотношению цена/качество, особенно если вы, как и я, в Азии в первый раз.  Вкусная еда, отзывчивый персонал, хорошее месторасположение.  Отелем мы были очень довольны. 

Дополнительная информация, не касающаяся отеля:

 Через дорогу напротив отеля - супермаркет с фиксированными ценами. 

Фрукты. Если встать лицом к супермаркету (и спиной к отелю), по правую руку будет агенство ""Паша турс"", и рядышком с ним - фруктовая лавка с очень хорошими ценами и адекватным продавцом; Для примера - кокос в два раза дешевле, чем рядом с пляжем. 

Купание. Вообще хочу отметить, что в Хиккадуве купаться особо негде - на спокойном пляже черепах нет лежаков, лежишь ""а-ля Анапа"" на тряпочке на песке, и места мало. При этом почти нет тени. Места, где непосредственно купаешься - либо вместе с катерами (правда, их немного и почти не используются - то есть не прямо полноценная стоянка), либо в узком пространстве, окружённом камнями. 

Обмен денег на рупии можно производить в любом ювелирном магазине, курс не сильно отличается от аэропорта.

Экскурсию брали в ""Сурека турс"" (это если идти по улице в сторону черепахового пляжа, по правую руку). На трех взрослых и ребёнка индивидуальный тур на машине ""голубая лагуна, сад специй, шахта лунного камня и т.д."" обошёлся в 60 долларов на всех. 

В Галле мы ездили на автобусе (крейзи бас, приедете, поймёте😃) 388/(1, 2 или 3 - до Галле), остановка недалеко от отеля. Один билет - 100 рупий, ехать до конечной. Там дошли до старого города, взяли тук-тук и за 2 000 рупий (думаю, можно ещё попробовать поторговаться) нас покатали по основным точкам старого города, пофотографировали на наш же телефон и ещё водитель хотел свозить в новый город, но мы не поехали. У водителей при обговаривании цены всегда уточняйте - это ""финиш прайс""? Чтоб не накинули потом ещё цену в конце поездки. 

На тук-туке отдельно съездили посмотреть слона на ферме - вам будут предлагать слоновьи фермы в трёх часах езды отсюда, но этот слон живёт в 25 минутах езды от отеля. Поездка нам обошлась туда-сюда 3000 рупий сам тук-тук (брали возле отеля,  водитель - Nimal +94776508695); 8 000 рупий стоит билет,  чтобы покататься, покормить и пофотографироваться со слоном (детям скидка 50%), или 10 000 рупий дополнительно входит ещё и купание в реке. Пока ехали к слону, увидели красивый Буддистский храм, на обратном пути попросили водителя отвезти нас к нему. Храму 500 лет, внутри лежит 35 метровый Будда.  Не только нам, но и водителю было интересно, он нам немного рассказал про храм и традиции.","Отдыхала с ребёнком 4 года и родителями с 19.01. по 28.01.","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r991518654-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390812","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg","1200","3","33","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5262BK_","Наталья У","2F3C1F150CCAFC7E7992871F4BE59E4A",,"662362","Tyumen, Russia","Tyumen","F5262BK_"

Завтраки ооочень очень достойные, большой выбор и вкусно!!! У нас были только завтраки , поэтому не могу ничего сказать по поводу обеда и ужина! Но новогодний ужин был шикарен!!! Устрицы креветки , тунец, много морепродуктов, на любой вкус!!! Для детей куча сладостей и фруктов и мороженное.
 Разлекательная программа скромненькая. 
Пляж у отеля нету))) не зайти в море, но можно в тапках специальных пройтись и увидеть кучу живности от мурен и ежей до рыб разных. Мы ходили на 2 пляжа направо к черепашкам без волн и налево на волны.
Экскурсии. 
За экскурсией в Эллу (поезд, девятиарочный мост, пик адама) обращались к русскоговорящему гиду
Прасаду, его номер телефона +94784700761, пишите в whats app, го
Инстаграмм gid_srilanka_rus.
Экскурсия была дешевле, чем от туроператора и гораздо комфортнее. У нас был минивэн отдельный удобный и нас было 12 человек. Гид рассказал общую информацию о достопримечательностях, которой было вполне достаточно. Сделал нам хорошие фото. Удобно, когда  вас могут сфотографировать вместе. И это не просто фото, а действительно красивые фотографии. Очень душевных и хороший гид.  Сделал нам массаж по дороге(он оказывается работал массажистом раньше)Прасад понимает с какого ракурса будет лучше вид. Сделали очень много видео и фоток для инстаграмма.

We kept pushing for my order and that may have caused additional problems as I was ill during the night and following day as a result of the meal. The meal was a fish dish (see photo) that was supposed to come with yellow rice and a salad. Nothing but the fish arrived. Supposed to be spicy. It wasn't. The fish's face summed up the meal.

We’re thrilled that you enjoyed the breathtaking ocean views from your upstairs room and found it to be the perfect spot to unwind. It’s always rewarding to know when our guests find that sense of peace and serenity we aim to provide.
Your kind words about our team truly warm our hearts. Dilhara and the rest of the team will be delighted to know that their care and attention helped make your experience so memorable. We believe it’s those small, thoughtful touches—like the foot massage and personalised service—that help create truly special moments.

We only had the chance to experience this place for a day, but it left us wanting more 
The location the hotel is built on is superb, with unmatched views of the ocean in all directions

We stayed at the upstairs room which I think is the better choice compared to the more costly room with a pool in the downstairs.
The staff really took this place to the next level, offering the best care, and going out of their way to make the experience more memorable 

The food too , was excellent. Enjoying the meals while enjoying the calming waves of the sea, was so enjoyable. Also the complimentary brief  foot massage they provided was a nice touch.

It’s the peaceful vibe of this hotel , that makes this place such a great place to relax and unwind, detaching yourself from the world around.

Thank you so much for your beautifully detailed review of your stay at Jetwing Saman Villas. It was truly a pleasure to welcome you at the beginning of your journey through Sri Lanka, and we are delighted to hear that your experience with us was both relaxing and memorable.

Das Haupthaus und die einzelnen Lodges sind auf einem Felsen einige Meter über dem Meer erbaut worden, so dass man einen Ausblick auf 2 Strände und das Meer genießen kann. Die Architektur der gesamten Anlage ist zurückhaltend und zeitlos. Das Haupthaus ist zu beiden Ständen hin offen und bietet damit schöne Ausblicke, um z. B. den Sonnenuntergang zu verfolgen, was auch aus dem großen Pool möglich ist. 
Das Appartement selbst ist sehr gepflegt und großzügig. Auch hier, ein Teil des Bades hat kein  Dach, so dass man bei warmen Regen  in der großen Wanne sitzen kann. 
Das Essen ist gut (wir hatten Halbpension) und man kann bei Frühstück und Abendessen zwischen lokalen und westlichen Gerichten wählen.
Der Bereich für Wellness Behandlungen sind nur überdacht unter sonst freiem Himmel und haben wir gleich mehrfach genossen. 
Das Personal ist wie überall in SL sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, man hat während des Aufenthalts einen persönlichen Butler. Englischkenntnisse sind Voraussetzung zur Verständigung, das Hotel ist nur für Erwachsene. 
Auf jeden Fall ist das Hotel empfehlenswert, wenn man einen ruhigen, stilvollen Strandurlaub genießen möchte. 
Ein Ort in dem man sich auch für einige Tage sehr wohl fühlen kann. Wir haben es zu Beginn unserer Sri Lanka Rundreise gewählt.
Abschließend sei noch erwähnt, dass das Hotel zur Jetwing Kette gehört, die sich der Nachhaltigkeit verschrieben und sich selbst z. B. klare CO2 Neutralitätsziele gesetzt hat.","Stilvolles Hotel in traumhafter Strandumgebung","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297895-d306376-r1002032938-Jetwing_Saman_Villas_A_Luxury_Reserve-Bentota_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"4000","800484134","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/b6/6b/26/venture51819877935.jpg","4000","0","31","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture51819877935","MARTIN","37C63509E43342D29B195C1D6599641F",,"198393","Konstanz, Germany","Konstanz","Venture51819877935"

The villa was really spacious and had all the amenities you could want for your stay. We stayed in a few different locations in Sri Lanka and Jetwing was the only place where the air conditioning actually kept the room sufficiently cool in the heat and humidity!

There is access to both beaches either side with security making us feel extra safe. The beaches were both amazing and very quiet, often only another couple or 2 to share them with.

On cons; stayed in a triple bed room, however the spare bed was very uncomfortable. I have been in many stars hotels and the spare bed were always top notch, quite disappointed considering hertiance.
There was multiple power cuts trough out the night, so had to constantly call the reception, not the best night sleep with combined with the bad bed.

There are two large pools, and the view from the main pool is simply amazing.
The resort boasts a huge, clean beachfront, though the sea is quite rough, so swimming isn’t really possible.

We tried both the dinner and lunch buffets, which offered a nice spread of local and international dishes. However, the lighting in the restaurant could be improved — it feels a bit dark and uninviting.
That said, the staff were consistently friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

My husband had a spa massage which he reported to be fantastic (he’s quite the connoisseur), and we both enjoyed the “mini spa” (hot tub, steam room and sauna) which you can book for private use.

I loved starting my day by enjoying the view of the jungle from my balcony before a lovely breakfast, and a swim in the ocean only a few minutes walk away.

Heaps of rickshaws right out the front to take you further up the beach to the various restaurants.

"0","877187931","en","2054131",,"Owner","878167266","en","2023-02-10","Phil Jackson","Honestly we are really sorry that you didnt enjoy your short stay with us. Running a business in Sri Lanka can be challenging as can trying to live up to Westerners expectations. I hope that I can explain some mitigating circumstances for our short comings & apologize for your disappointment.

Electricity - Sri Lanka has had power cuts every day since March ( 11 months so far ) as the country is bankrupt we cant afford to import sufficient fuel for the power stations so there is power shedding daily ( we have a generator during these cuts ) but the huge majority of Sri Lankans have to suffer in the heat & dark because of this so we respectfully ask our guests to please not use extra power when they are not in their rooms.
Mosquitoes - We are next to the jungle so there are mosquitoes around, there are mosquito coils in the rooms to use.
Housekeeping - It is true that we dont change towels & sheets daily unless the guests ask us. The increase in hotels in Mirissa means that in the dry season we have to buy in water in on bowsers as our well does not always fill up quickly enough & the mains water is pretty much turned off apart from a couple of hours at night.
You are correct that we dont have hot water in the sink taps only solar hot water in the showers. As the temperature never drops below 25 degrees here all year we dont feel it necessary. 
Dinner - Sorry that our chef was off the night you arrived. There are over 50 restaurants within 2 km of our hotel. Because of the situation in the country last year there were no tourists for 7 months which has obviously affected our staffing levels, we could not afford extra chefs when there is no business. This is also the reason for not having any credit card facilities, you have to do a certain amount of business for the banks to let you have one here and over the last 4 years we have had no business for 3 of them ( 6 months after the Easter bombings, 2 years of Covid & 7 months last year due to the countries bankruptcy & demonstrations ). When you booked with booking.com it does clearly state cash only but as you say we do have various linked foreign accounts for transfers & there are plenty of ATM's in Mirissa.
I am not sure what you mean by pool is not as big as in the pictures. We do have two pools, the main one used by 9 of our rooms and a separate one for the use of the 3 rooms in spice villa.
Once again sorry that we let you down & not to excuse it but hopefully now you can understand more some of the difficulties that we face here.
Kind regards,
Phil & Wathsala - Owners of The Spice House, Mirissa

So much so, we decided we would seek alternative accommodation to stay at after our 1st night...
A warm greeting did await our arrival... but from that point, things went downhill on our experience...
The Owners wife explained that no dinner would be available because their chef was attending a wedding, which is great for him, but what do we do for food?
So we had to get our driver to hunt out a restaurant in the area so we could eat..
So if you book any establishment and it says food is available, then if your chef has family commitments, you still have an obligation to your guests/ clients in relation to a booking made with you..
It's your responsibility to ensure what is described on booking materials is actually available..
The room was small and too dark for our taste..
When we left the room too go out, we left fan/ aircon on to keep room cool..
When we returned it had been switched off..
Now if I pay for something, I expect to use it for the time I've paid for..
Never experienced this happening anywhere in the world during our many travels..
No hot water available for using sink in the bathroom..strange , but true..
Many mosquitoes ( which I totally understand with the nature of the country), but in all other hotels we've used in Sri Lanka, they have repellent in rooms..
Either electronic or sticks...
Sheets aren't changed daily..
So if you're sweatting and having to keep using sheets, that's not good in my opinion..
One other point, the owner wanted cash in regards settling bill..
No cards accepted at all..
Or you can send money to their UK or EUROPEAN  bank accounts..( very strange in my opinion..)
I certainly wouldn't transfer any money from my account while abroad..
If you like overlooking just houses and small forest type  area, then you'll be fine..
pool is OK but not as big as pictures for advertising seem to suggest..
Camera angles in adverts and paraphernalia always look goid dint they in many a hotel..
No good for us. I'm afraid.. 
As I titled review..dissapointing experience..
You watch the odd review written to put this down the line..

We stayed in the Clove Cabin which is just outside the main house. The room was perfect for our needs and having a fridge to keep everything cold was ideal. The cabin had a lovely size balcony and in the afternoon you can sit and watch the monkeys, palm squirrels and the beautiful coloured birds. The grounds are beautiful, lucious and really well kept. The pool area's in both the main area and in the Spice Villa are peaceful and so relaxing. They have a lovely team, always willing to help and always smiling.

Bargain with everyone everywhere. Turtle beach is only worth going to once. The server beach is better. But there's mor",,,,,,,,,,,,,"By European standards, it is 3 stars. Stayed in it for 8 days, the hotel has both pros and cons.
Not a bad hotel for Sri Lanka. But you have to remember that this is not Turkey or other resorts. It has its own atmosphere, and the hotel is written out in it

Location: Located in a good location, near a large supermarket, a lot of good cafes and vendors with souvenirs.

Beach: For swimming is not suitable, immediately goes coral reef. That would swim need to walk five minutes to other beaches. Near the beach with turtles, but I would not recommend swimming there. A lot of people, parked boats, and next to the river-stock of waters. The bay is quiet though.

Hotel: the hotel is taken care of, but on local. In places gray, but from the humidity can not go anywhere. In the room did not work one bulb, the door to the balcony was like after the war. But the rooms are spacious, air conditioning works properly. Nothing was stolen.Also I will note as a plus, at us poisoned mosquitoes on the territory. For all time we saw only two of them. Dengue can not be afraid. On the wildlife, the hotel is large, so scarce. Lizards, ants, and crows. On the tree sometimes there were chipmunks.

Staff: The staff is not annoying, on tips do not ask for tips, quickly fall behind. But the local callers often spin not far from the hotel, and every day fool the head.

Food: usual for Sri Lanka. There are both local spicy dishes and not spicy cuisine. There was enough fruit. Although, only breakfast is enough, there are a lot of cafes nearby.

Services: there is a restaurant where the food is quite good, the prices are slightly above average in Sri. There is also a massage. On the territory of sunbeds for sunbathing, towels are issued, but you can not take them to the beach. Ryadam cool diving services. Guys are professionals.","If you don't want a guest house, this hotel is worth considering","2024-02","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304134-d609883-r981015165-Citrus_Hikkaduwa-Hikkaduwa_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1786","754865260","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2c/fe/54/6c/caption.jpg","2048","2","52","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrl508","Alexandr L","DF256740A9B2E6B42FE7CDE95AE12CA1",,"294448","Minsk, Belarus","Minsk","alexandrl508"

The downside to this hotel came at the pool. We arrived at the pool after breakfast at 9.30 am and managed to secure some of the last sunbeds, with many reserved but no one using them. The 2 beds next to use were reserved for more than 5 hours before guests came to use them, this should not be tolerated by the pool team as the pool area is comparatively small to the hotels capacity reserving of sunbeds should not be allowed.

Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback regarding your recent stay at Shangri-La Colombo. We genuinely appreciate your loyalty, and we are truly sorry to hear that your second visit did not meet the high standards you experienced during your first stay.

This was my second visit to this hotel. My first visit was in October 2024, and I must say, I was absolutely delighted back then, which is why I recommended it to a few friends who joined me this time.

However, my experience this time was somewhat different. It started right at check-in, which took an unreasonably long time. The staff was very friendly, but we had to wait far too long to get to our rooms, even though we arrived at the hotel after 3 PM.

Another issue was the selection of drinks at the pool bar—it was very limited, and I struggled to find something suitable for myself. Additionally, given the hotel's category and level, I expected better housekeeping services. Specifically, I anticipated a turndown service in the evening, but no one came to check if we needed anything. This was quite surprising to me.

One of the biggest disappointments was the dining experience. We had dinner at the à la carte restaurant, Shang Palace. We ordered a multi-course menu, and while the food itself was delicious, the service and presentation left much to be desired. Instead of serving individual portions for all five guests, they brought everything in large communal dishes and scooped the food onto our plates. The overall presentation was unappealing and not up to the standards expected from a luxury hotel.

Breakfast was an even bigger disappointment. I remembered Shangri-La for having one of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had. As someone who travels extensively for work—staying/inspecting in over 200 hotels per year—I had high expectations. This time, the experience was very different. I wanted fresh mango juice, which was readily available on my previous visit, but this time, the selection of fresh juices was extremely limited—they only had three options. I ordered an orange juice, but it never arrived. Similarly, I requested a coffee and was given one from a machine more suited to a three-star hotel, rather than a proper espresso from a professional machine. Even after specifically mentioning it, I received the same poor-quality coffee again. Overall, breakfast was a major letdown.

I must say that I am disappointed with the hotel. For my next visit to Colombo, I will have to reconsider whether I return. A renowned hotel chain like Shangri-La should not allow such a decline.","Shangri-la you can do better!","2025-02","BUSINESS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d12720953-r995193577-Shangri_La_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html",,,,,,"0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slodani","slodani","6EF3447B6F37AF095BBED0C17CB87C84",,"274874","Maribor, Slovenia","Maribor","slodani"

Thank you for sharing such an inspiring and joyful review! We're absolutely thrilled to know that your time at Cinnamon Life was not only productive but also filled with meaningful moments, exceptional service, and genuine connections.

It’s wonderful to hear that Studio provided the perfect setting for your work in the wedding industry, and that your guests and clients were able to engage with you in such a dynamic environment.

A heartfelt thank you for recognizing Nigel and Raveshaa—your kind words about their professionalism, attentiveness, and support in every detail of your stay will mean the world to them.

We’re so glad you enjoyed the culinary offerings at Gatz and Bistro as well—our chefs will be delighted to hear the food “was killing it!”

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your heartfelt feedback following your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana.
We are truly delighted to hear that your experience, though brief, left such a lasting impression. It brings us great joy to know that the natural setting, the serene surroundings, and the unique design of our dwellings created a “heavenly” escape for you. Your kind words about our cuisine, the inviting plunge pool in your Paddy Dwelling, and the immersive experiences around the property — from biking to the private Sigiriya viewpoint — are sincerely appreciated.

I am also happy to hear that Lakshan provided warm and attentive service, as did the rest of our team. We are grateful that you noticed the many thoughtful touches, such as the complimentary minibar and the peaceful forest paths that wind through our property.
However, I would also like to sincerely apologize for the discrepancy regarding the Bose Home Entertainment system. Your observation is noted, and we will ensure that the details presented on our website are updated to reflect the current in-room facilities, so expectations are always aligned.

Thank you once again for your glowing recommendation. We would be honoured to welcome you back for a longer stay in the future — so you can continue to enjoy the tranquil beauty and personalized care that define Jetwing Vil Uyana.

The eco lodge concept has been executed to near perfection, and whilst the tangible aspects of the venue are breathtaking, it is the service that is truly superior to anywhere that I've experienced. We were taken care of our personal butler, Suranga, aided by his colleague, Sanoj. They went above and beyond to make sure we well taken care of and anticipated all our needs. The food was generous and absolutely delicious. The onsite farm tour was an organic experience in itself, and the Loris bushwalk at nightfall was a cherry on the top of a beautiful stay. The only thing I could say needs improvement was at the Spa. The vibe we got from the staff there was in stark contrast to the warmth and hospitality from everyone else at the eco lodge. All in all, yes, it is pricey compared to many other places in Sri Lanka, however, I would happily spend every cent all over again given the opportunity to do so.","A unique and breath-taking experience","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r1011051908-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452390504","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127indyw","Indy W","254122699C92B47750406F7F3863D526",,,,,"127indyw"

Thank you for your wonderful review and for choosing to stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. It’s a true pleasure to read that your experience with us was filled with memorable moments — from the magical wildlife encounters to the peaceful jungle setting of our unique dwellings. We’re especially glad that you enjoyed the sense of space and privacy across the property, along with the special touches we’ve curated to enhance every guest’s stay.

Your kind words about the food, especially our breakfast offerings, are greatly appreciated. I'm also pleased to know our team was able to accommodate your early start and still welcome you back with a warm breakfast — a small gesture that means a lot to us. Thank you as well for highlighting Thusara’s attentive service. He, along with the rest of our team, is truly passionate about creating memorable and personalized experiences for our guests, and I will certainly share your compliments with him. We're glad you made the most of our central location to explore the wonders of the Cultural Triangle, and that thoughtful touches like sarongs for temple visits and welcome snacks made your stay even more enjoyable.

It was our pleasure to host you, and we truly appreciate your high recommendation. We hope to welcome you back again soon for another unforgettable experience in our little sanctuary.

The food was excellent and we were particularly impressed with the choice at breakfast. We had a really early start one morning but they sent us off with some pastries and still welcomed us for breakfast on our return. 
The staff are amazing, particularly Thusara who looked after us throughout. We also loved the little touches like offering a small plate of snacks on arrival and  with evening drinks and putting sarongs in the bedrooms for the temples.

Thank you for sharing your kind feedback following your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. We are delighted to hear that your time with us in Sigiriya was both serene and memorable. Our unique setting — nestled amidst lush paddy fields, wetlands, and waterways — is truly one of our greatest treasures, and we’re so pleased it added to the charm of your experience.

It’s heartening to know that your dwelling, offered the comfort and tranquility you were looking for. I’m especially glad to hear that Ravi provided attentive and personalized service throughout your stay. We are equally proud of our resident naturalist, Yesitha, whose deep knowledge and passion for wildlife help create unforgettable experiences — such as spotting the elusive slender loris! Thank you also for recognizing the collective efforts of our front desk, housekeeping, and restaurant teams. Your kind words mean a great deal to all of us and serve as a wonderful motivation.

Warm greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing such a thoughtful and heartfelt review. It brings me immense joy to know that your two‑day retreat in our Paddy Dwelling with plunge pool provided the peace, luxury, and immersion in nature that we strive to create for every guest. I am delighted that our personal butler service and the attentive care of our team contributed to your comfort and tranquility. Your kind words about our staff’s warmth and readiness to assist will be shared with them—they will be deeply encouraged by your feedback.

I’m also pleased you enjoyed the Loris Trail with our naturalist, even though the elusive lorises remained hidden on that occasion. Our conservation efforts are very dear to us, and we’re happy the insights shared brought you closer to appreciating these remarkable creatures and our ongoing initiatives. Our eco‑friendly design, inspired by traditional Sri Lankan architecture, aims to blend seamlessly with the surrounding wetlands, paddy fields, and forest canopy. It is wonderful to hear that the harmony of nature and culture resonated with you and enhanced your luxury experience.

While two days provided a snapshot of our sanctuary, we wholeheartedly agree that Jetwing Vil Uyana truly shines over a week—or more—allowing time to savour every moment, explore our botanical and wildlife trails, and indulge in our holistic wellness offerings.
We look forward to welcoming you back for an extended stay so you can continue your journey of peace, beauty, and eco‑luxury with us. Please let us know when you wish to return, and we will be honored to plan another unforgettable experience for you.

Cultivating a service culture grounded in genuine care and attentiveness is at the heart of Vil Uyana’s philosophy, and your feedback is an affirmation for all of us.

On your next visit, we would be happy to arrange a seamless transfer and to stock your villa with any snacks or provisions you prefer in advance.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

I’m delighted that you found our retreat “next level” in service, and I will be sure to pass along your heartfelt compliments to Ravi. It’s wonderful to hear how attentively he anticipated your needs—though I must admit, our culinary team still chuckles at the “curry and chips” request! Rest assured, we always aim to surprise and delight where we can, while still honoring the authentic flavors and traditions that make Sri Lankan cuisine so special.

Your description of our tranquil grounds resonating with the serenity of a Buddhist temple truly captures the essence of Jetwing Vil Uyana’s philosophy. I’m pleased that your dwelling provided a spacious, pristine sanctuary and that you enjoyed waking up to those peaceful morning views across the wetlands. Thank you, too, for appreciating the variety and quality of our dining options. We look forward to crafting a menu of both familiar comforts and local specialties during your next visit—perhaps including a cheeky nod to “chips” alongside a signature curry!

When you’re ready to return and indulge in a more leisurely pace, please do reach out directly. I would be honored to arrange a personalized itinerary that balances cultural exploration with all the relaxation and pampering our retreat can offer.

Warm greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed our lakeside rooms and had ample opportunity to observe the abundant wildlife that makes Vil Uyana so special. I will be sure to pass along your compliments to our culinary team—I know they will be thrilled that you found our restaurant offerings exceptional each evening.

I’m particularly pleased that Lakshan, your personal butler, made such a positive impression. Our team take great pride in anticipating and attending to every guest’s needs, and your feedback is a wonderful affirmation of their efforts. Thank you, too, for letting us know about the gym’s air-conditioning. I apologize for any discomfort you experienced during those first few minutes of your workout. I have spoken with our engineering team, and they are adjusting the controls so that the gym will maintain a cool temperature at all times.

We truly appreciate your feedback and look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back to Jetwing Vil Uyana in the near future. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly when planning your next stay, and I will be delighted to assist you with any arrangements.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for sharing your thoughtful reflections on your recent three-night stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed our prime location for exploring Sigiriya Rock and that Samman, your dedicated butler, made your stay extra special—he’ll be thrilled to know his service stood out.
It’s wonderful that you embraced the charm of our Marsh Dwelling and its quirky “outdoor” bathroom, and that you found time to relax in your private spa bath after hiking. I must apologize for the unexpected frog encounter in the pipes—it seems our local wildlife fancied an upgrade! Rest assured, our engineering team is now double-checking all plumbing to make sure your next bath is frog-free. I’m glad you enjoyed spotting the playful monkeys by the pool and that our breakfast offerings hit the mark. I’m sorry, however, that our dinner menu became repetitive during your three-night stay. We’re already expanding seasonal options and rotating daily specials to keep our culinary program fresh and exciting for returning guests.

Regarding the open-air spa pavilions and the inevitable insects they attract, I appreciate your understanding of the balance between nature immersion and comfort. We are continually enhancing our citronella gardens, installing additional screening where possible, and providing extra insect-repellent amenities in each treatment room.

Thank you again for highlighting both what thrilled you and where we can improve. We hope to welcome you back soon in the future.

We used the bath/spa in the room after hiking Sigiriya. Lovely deep bath, but be careful of frogs in the pipes! We accidentally boiled some... 🐸 

Our pool area was lovely and we got to see some ""greedy"" monkeys playing in the trees which was very special. 

The food was ok, not great not bad. The menu was the same everyday, so 3 days was enough time to get bored of the offering. The breakfast however was good. Try and spot the crocodile!

The spa was ok, good value. A 90 minute massage was £45 GBP. However, the spa treatment rooms are open above the water so there were a lot of bugs.

","Value","5","Rooms","5","Location","5","Cleanliness","5","Service","5","Sleep Quality","5","We spent 7 nights at Uga Chena Huts on an all inclusive basis booking via Emirates Holidays.  Very relaxed place to be and rather informal which we appreciated.  Situated on  a picturesque beach  (not suitable  for swimming) and  adjacent to  Yala National Park. Plenty of wildlife to see within the parameters of the hotel itself, hence the need to have a Ranger with you when walking the beach.  Cocktails and nibbles available daily at sunset from a beach bar. The Huts are nestled in the bushes , provide privacy, are spacious, luxurious and kept  immaculately clean with everything you would need, including laundry service.  Private decks are large and  have a shower ,  and each hut has its own jacuzzi- swimming pool.  We stayed in Hut 2 on arrival  for three nights and had lots of wildlife visitors throughout the day and night, especially monkeys which we immensely enjoyed watching . We moved to Hut 1 just to get an ocean view.  Not so many wildlife  visitors  to Hut 1 though an elephant did walk along the beach on our last evening!.  
Mini bar was free and well stocked though the  wines left a lot to be desired!!. Room was serviced twice a day.  Bed is enormous and extremely comfortable. Wifi is good and reliable. We used the hotel pool  and the spa facilities and thoroughly enjoyed them. 
The staff are  all exceptional. Every member of staff was  pleasant, polite, and couldn't do enough for you.  The food is extremely good, imaginative dishes, varied menu, quality,  fresh local  ingredients  and a chef who takes pride in what he produces.  What lets the restaurant down is the wine that is available. It's terrible, poor quality and limited choice  and not befitting of a 5* hotel or the fabulous food the chef produces.  We did mention it and we hope something is done to rectify this .  
We had the services of an excellent knowledgeable Ranger for our five safaris and we also visited Sithulpawwa Temple with him. He also took us   to a local fishing village and  on  a beach walk  in the vicinity of the hotel.  We saw everything we wanted to  on the Safari's and thoroughly enjoyed them. The hotel provides a picnic for each trip too.  
We would highly recommend this place.","A"" MUST GO TO "" destination!!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1011640995-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"205","19820685","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/8d/avatar014.jpg","205","29","69","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janets560","janet s","B12EC8886C5B295FDCDA104A73DB8B2C",,,,,"janets560"

Nestled between the lush Yala jungle and the sparkling Indian Ocean, this luxury eco-resort effortlessly blends nature with elegance — and every moment we spent there felt like a dream.

The Vibe:
There’s a peaceful energy throughout the property — calming, rejuvenating, and full of soul. You’re surrounded by nature, but the comfort is uncompromising. The thatched-roof villas are spacious, beautifully appointed, and come with private plunge pools and outdoor decks where you can hear the jungle hum around you. It’s luxury in its most natural and refined form.

The Food & Gastronomy:
The culinary experience at Uga Chena Huts is second to none. Every meal was a celebration of Sri Lankan flavors, with an exquisite touch of international flair. From freshly caught seafood to fragrant local curries, each dish was crafted with care, creativity, and authenticity. A special thank you to Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara from the main restaurant, whose attentive service and warm smiles made every meal feel like a five-star experience — their hospitality was as unforgettable as the food itself.

The Safari Rides:
The game drives into Yala National Park were beyond thrilling. Our friendly ranger Sandun was not only incredibly knowledgeable but also genuinely passionate about the wildlife and the land. He brought the jungle to life with fascinating stories and insights, and we were lucky enough to witness some breathtaking animal encounters, including the majestic Sri Lankan leopard.

The Bar & Lounge Experience: Best smoothie ever, so do the cocktails.
Evenings at the lounge were something we looked forward to every day. Whether it was a craft cocktail or a custom creation inspired by local flavors, the bartenders never failed to impress. Huge thanks to Sathish and Nuwan, whose skill and charm behind the bar turned each drink into a celebration. Their energy and attention to detail added a vibrant and fun touch to our nights at Uga.

The Front Office & Service:
A very special thanks to Deshan and Dasun his front office colleagues at the front office who always pick us from buggy and guide us always — your kindness, constant support, and genuine care truly made us feel at home oh that sarcasm 😉 . From organizing our experiences to ensuring every detail was perfect, Deshan went above and beyond for us every step of the way. The entire front office team was friendly, efficient, and always ready with a warm smile — the true embodiment of Sri Lankan hospitality.

Final Thoughts:
Uga Chena Huts is more than just a luxury retreat — it’s a heartfelt experience where nature, comfort, and people come together in the most beautiful way. Thanks to the incredible team — especially Deshan, Sathish, Nuwan, Gayal, Kalum, and Chamara — our stay was filled with unforgettable moments, amazing flavors, wild adventures, and genuine human connection.

We may have forgotten some of the names who helped us throughout our stay. Cheers to all of them.

I can’t fault our stay at all. The hotel is located in a beautiful part of the park with dramatic sea views that the hotels architecture makes the most off. 

The food was some of the best we’ve had at hotels in Sri Lanka.

Rooms are luxurious (the bed is insanely big and comfortable) and feel at one with nature, whilst also doing a good job of keeping the bugs/animals outside and sound proofing against nature! Having a pool right outside was a nice bonus in the heat. 

We visited the spa for massages in between safari rides and the massages were excellent! Definitely recommend a visit to the spa if you can. 

Our safari rides were amazing and we were fortunate enough to see the elephants and leopards! The hotel sends you out in small groups with their extremely knowledgeable rangers who are respectful of our comfort and of the national park and animals. 

Going out on safari with ranger Jabaya was the highlight, you could tell he really cared about the animals and about ensuring we had a good safari. Ultimately it’s all down to luck as to what you will and won’t see but his knowledge of the park and animal behaviours certainty helped us to see some amazing animals. 

The hotel had lots of little touches, like the snacks provided during the safari trips, and the sundowner session (beach front cocktails and canapés before dinner) which really helped to make the stay special. 

If you’re looking for a safari hotel/excursion which balances excellent safari trips, relaxation and luxury then this is undoubtably the hotel for you!","Luxury safari perfection!","2025-04","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1004480002-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452389949","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg","1200","0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethiJ9464OV","Elizabeth I","1DD38ADB25D6934FBD626C82FF2A5BC1",,,,,"elizabethiJ9464OV"

Les points positifs :
Le personnel est un vrai atout : serviable, souriant et très professionnel. Les huts sont magnifiques, spacieuses et impeccablement propres. La piscine est superbe et très agréable. La restauration est correcte, bien que j’aurais apprécié davantage de spécialités sri-lankaises à la carte. Mention spéciale au guide et au chauffeur, très compétents et attentifs.

Les points négatifs :
L’emplacement est extrêmement isolé : comptez environ cinq heures de route depuis Colombo ou Kandy. La plage, bien que proche, est non baignable et potentiellement dangereuse. Il n’y a rien à faire aux alentours, et l’unique raison de venir ici est l’espoir d’apercevoir un léopard. Malheureusement, si ce n’est pas le cas (comme pour moi), l’intérêt du séjour devient très limité.

J’ai participé au safari à 6h du matin. Après trois heures, je n’ai aperçu que quelques oiseaux, un crocodile, trois éléphants, des buffles domestiques… et des dizaines de 4x4. Beaucoup de bruit, peu de faune sauvage visible – l’effet d’un tourisme de masse ? Aucun léopard, pas d’ours. J’ai d’ailleurs vu bien plus d’animaux en dehors du parc, sur les routes environnantes.

En résumé :
Le site ne justifie ni l’isolement ni le prix, que je trouve excessif, voire indécent, au vu de l’expérience globale. Il serait plus juste d’en demander deux à trois fois moins. Sans la garantie (impossible, évidemment) d’observer un léopard, le séjour perd tout son attrait.","Un séjour contrasté : entre confort et déception","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1004272489-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","2","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandreD4118","Alexandre D","DAA89F22A5EB4C65450920BD116A6B87",,"2623728","Vesenaz, Switzerland","Vesenaz","AlexandreD4118"

We feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to have experienced Uga Chena. Firstly every member of staff will do anything to make sure your stay is beyond perfection. There is nothing they wouldn’t do for you. I couldn’t single out anyone as everyone who helped look after my family was just so wonderful. I have to say though our safari guide Jayaba was just the GOAT (my sons word!) and our driver we renamed Lewis Hamilton with  the best hair in Sri Lanka was the absolute best. Our safaris were incredible ….. off the beaten track away from the crowds so we really felt that it was just us in the park. We could see all the wonders of nature in its true beauty. We were truly blessed. 

The food is exceptional. Again nothing is too much trouble. My son has a severe peanut allergy and everyone was so careful which we were so grateful for. The portions were perfectly sized. During the safaris they pack you a selection of yummy snacks and drinks. The banana bread is divine! 

The resort itself is so sympathetically built into its environment with the respect the animals need. The pool area is lovely secluded to not attract any animals with attentive staff ready to bring you a refreshing cocktail. Sundowners on the beach each evening with snacks and more cocktails. 

The safaris take place at 6am and you are usually back for 9:30 to enjoy breakfast. The afternoon safaris take place at 3:15 and you are usually back by 6 for sun downers. Try to embrace all of the nature that Yala has to offer as I was just as guilty of it but if you become fixated on just wanting to see a leopard you will miss how beautiful your surroundings are. 

The huts themselves are spacious and luxurious. UK plugs and voltage. Laundry is included up to 15 items per day. We went in April and it was very warm so light clothing was all we needed. There are ponchos in the safari truck. Khaki coloured clothing is recommended to keep the insects away. Shorts  and a t shirt are fine even in the morning. With trainers. My husband wore flip flops … you don’t get out so you don’t need to wear sensible footwear but if you did need to get out in an emergency the terrain is muddy and uneven.  You can go straight to diner as you are. Or you can change for dinner into something more glam if you prefer. It isn’t formal though. But I did put a dress on two nights! 

Four nights felt like the perfect stay. As the resort is worth experiencing so you can relax. With four / five safaris. Our safaris were totally private which we preferred. The safaris are bumpy but it’s so much fun … And exhilarating. The safari jeeps are covered so you don’t need a hat and it will blow away unless you have string. 

You won’t be disappointed if you choose to stay here. It’s a truly a bucket list all round experience. 

Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.","Natural paradise perfection","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1002047526-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","32","56","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candyfloss26","candyfloss26","AE84EC62FF1B45BCE608831DBB91602A",,"2154462","Danbury, United Kingdom","Danbury","candyfloss26"

Overrated. 

I’ll start with the positives: 

-Rooms are nice and spacious, maybe a touch dated but overall solid quality. Outdoor pool is good but again pretty dated. 

-Food is awesome. Not the best we had in Sri Lanka but very solid cooking. 

Now the negatives:

-Safaris are laughable. This was supposed to be the highlight of the stay and the reason to go to Yala. Our guide was essentially useless - did not point things out, just sat in the car. Driving was erratic at best and dangerous at worst. We almost canceled the rest of our stay after the first night it was so bad. 

-Management was nowhere to be found. We brought up our negative safari experience to the front desk and asked to speak with a manager - this resulted in them sending over the safari guide who we proceeded to have a highly confrontational, uncomfortable, and awkward conversation with. 

-The wine list is comically bad. For an all-inclusive hotel priced at $1500+/night I expect better than $5/bottle wine. And even the options to purchase were limited / uninteresting. 

At the end of the day, there are FAR better resorts for FAR less $ in Sri Lanka. Shoutout to Haritha Villas & Spa in Hikkaduwa (for example). 

Uga Chena is way overhyped and incredibly overpriced. Most of the time we were saying things like “damn - I really wish this hotel was as good as their marketing.”","Waste of Money","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1001759940-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","0","8","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanheintz","Ryan H","CC29B2723A46545BB7C907B45F4B703C",,,,,"ryanheintz"

Thank you once again for your lovely review. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back to Heritance Ahungalla for another relaxing and memorable stay.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback following your recent stay at Heritance Ahungalla.

We are truly grateful for your kind words about our team. It brings us great joy to hear that our staff – from the Guest Experience Officer to our bartenders, cooks, lifeguards, and security – contributed so positively to your stay. A special thank you for mentioning Captain Nelka, Captain Kalinga, Jogatia, and Thamsha from the pool bar. We will be sure to pass along your compliments to them – they will be delighted to know they made a meaningful impact.

We’re pleased that you appreciated our beachfront location, tropical surroundings, and distinctive architecture, as well as the overall ambiance of your room.

We also sincerely thank you for your honest and constructive observations regarding areas where we can improve. We understand your concerns about the room lighting design, the occasional presence of insects during the rainy season, and the organization of entertainment and activities. Your feedback regarding food quality and variety is also noted and will be shared with our culinary team for review.

At Heritance Ahungalla, we constantly strive to elevate the guest experience, and your insights are invaluable in helping us do so. While we are glad that you found value in our location, beach, pool, and – most importantly – our people, we also recognize the areas you feel fell short of your expectations. Please rest assured that your comments will be carefully reviewed with the relevant departments to ensure improvements are made.

Thank you once again for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your honest reflections. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for a more enhanced experience in the future.

We had lots of nice interactions with everyone starting from the Guest Experience Officer lady, through bartenders and cooks, finishing on life guards and security. We want to emphasize work of guys from pool bar (and probably misspell their names :) ) - captain Nelka, captain Kalinga, barman Jogatia and Thamsha. Unquestionably staff is the strongest point of that hotel.
Hotel is located next to the wonderful sand beach with tropical flora and fauna. It doesn't look like another boring hotel from Turkey, Spain or Greece. Its architecture is something refreshing and memorable.
Rooms also look very pleasant and not cheap. However the first problems appear there. It takes time to understand how light switches are organized and there is no main light source on the ceiling. Instead we got a big fan which was pointless with working air conditioning. Also if you are scared of insects better be prepared to meet some in the bathroom after rains. Hotel staff proposed us change of the room but we chose just additional insect spraying. If you want to go to tropics, expect tropical animals. :)
Huge disadvantage of this hotel is lack of any activities. Live band performances were the only thing happening there. We saw an animator maybe once when they were flying kites with kids. The animation plan in the hallway had nothing to do with reality. If you want to only sunbath, swim and chill it could be the advantage but it is not what is being sold here.
Food was mostly good but there was also some inedible foods. South Asian cuisine itself is very tasty and you will be able to experience that here. However some pork was impossible to bite and chicken almost always contained little bones which can make you choke to death.
Overall this hotel is nice but it is not a five star experience. It was just like an average three star hotel in Europe but located in more exotic location. Friendly staff is the biggest jewel in its crown. Next are beautiful beach and big main pool. Beside these three things Heritance Ahungalla doesn't offer anything memorable.

In the end it is important to mention locals selling trips and clothes next to the hotel. You will always encounter them when going to the beach or even walking next to the fence. They are very friendly but remember that every interaction is meant to sell you more stuff with relatively high price. But if you negotiate prices and stay assertive, you can have a great experience for relatively low cost.","The best average hotel","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r1007687540-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389554","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg","1200","1","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685grzegorzj","Grzegorz J","09D70B4CEF437ECFB2E498E67849B13E",,"274725","Gdansk, Poland","Gdansk","685grzegorzj"

Thank you for sharing such a heartfelt and insightful review of your experience at Heritance Ahungalla.

We are so pleased to hear that you admired the unique architecture by Geoffrey Bawa, and that the open, colonial-style design resonated with you. It’s wonderful that Dulshan could share his knowledge of Bawa’s legacy, as his work is truly an integral part of the Sri Lankan architectural heritage.

We are also grateful for your kind words about our staff. It’s always our goal to make our guests feel at home, and we are glad to hear we succeeded in doing so.

Your feedback means a great deal to us, and we would be honored to welcome you back for another stay, where you can continue to enjoy the beauty of Sri Lanka’s architecture and the warmth of our service.

So yummy. The infinity pool was just mesmerizing and they had unique chalets as well. The inside of the chalet had a large bathroom and the bedroom was not that much spacious but it was cozy and nice. I was so in love with the hotel but One thing I experienced was the bad smell that came out of the washroom as the room and the bathroom was kinda connected through a door. We informed the necessary parties about this and they came to fix the smell but the bad smell was still there. That was the only negative thing that I encountered. We went snorkeling in the morning and got to see the most insane beautiful unrealistic sunset that i have ever seen as the sky was blood red and orange. I wish I could capture that moment but couldn’t as my phone battery died. I would love to visit this hotel again as this was that good.","Pasikudah diaries","2024-09","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1013711175-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",,"1538","807608679","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/23/21/67/caption.jpg","1536","0","64","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail49327733653","JRansi","4037B76603A7C7479E24DA282ED03DE5",,"8686205","Pannipitiya, Sri Lanka","Pannipitiya","Trail49327733653"

Rooms were very clean. Service really tried their best to make us feel homely. From the amenities we used the Spa for massages and had a glorious time there. We also went snorkeling which was great. Beach was very clean and they provided for everything. The gym is small but it has some free weights and even a bench. Regarding the food we only had breakfast booked and ate dinner in the a la carte restaurants. (2 of them there). They really did their best to accommodate for my gluten free diet ( Including a very good gluten free bread for breakfast) Also they really went out of their way to decorate our room for my birthday.
They also have a separate room for activities such as table tennis and pool. 
Only thing to improve on: whenever there was a larger group we had to wait for service for a long time. Waiters as well as house keeping. They needed to be reminded several times for us to get more water for our room for example. (So that in the end we went and got it ourselves) The available staff is extremely kind however there are just too few of them.

The shower was nice, not airconditioning but it had a fan. Breakfast was great-must try egg hopper plus pork bacon. We asked the chef to have a seafood feast on our last night and they delivered. 2 lobsters, 8 prawns and some crabs. You can dine in the main dining area, no airconditioning but lots of fans. Overall a great relaxing trip. Everything was clean, our rooms are cleaned everyday, water refilled. The men came around at night to refill any water bottles and the mini fridge/bar inside your room.

Mai bis zum 02. Juni 2025 besucht. Der Aufenthalt war fantastisch. Schon bei der Ankunft wurde man super freundlich willkommen geheißen. Es gab zur Begrüßung einen Blumenkranz und einen traditionellen Farbklecks auf die Stirn. 

Die Mitarbeiter des Hotels sind alle durchweg super freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wenn man morgens nur in Richtung Pool oder Strand ging kamen sofort die Mitarbeiter an und tragen einem seine Handtücher nach. Immer wieder wurde gefragt ob man irgendwas zu trinken oder Essen haben möchte. 

Die Zimmer waren geräumig und alles was man benötigte war vorhanden. Die Sauberkeit war sehr gut. Im Badezimmer wurde man des Öfteren von Geckos besucht 😉
Das Essen war super lecker, morgens wie auch die meisten Abende gab es Buffet mit großer Auswahl auch an einheimischen Essen. Der Schärfegrad war teilweise herausfordernd 😉

Der Strand war wunderschön und super sauber, genauso wie das Meer. Keinerlei Müll am Strand oder im Wasser, das war ein tolles Erlebnis. Für mich einer der schönsten Strände die ich bisher besucht habe. 

Zuletzt noch ein herzliches Dankeschön an ALLE Mitarbeiter diese hervorragenden Hotels. Hier kann man keinen herausnehmen, sondern alle waren einfach nur Klasse.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana! 

Thank you for taking the time to share your impressions of Jetwing Vil Uyana. I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spacious Forest Dwelling with Pool. 

Please allow me to clarify our approach to comfort and sustainability: each of our dwellings are thoughtfully outfitted with a traditional sarong—placed in your room along with simple instructions on how to wear it—as an eco-friendly alternative to bathrobes. Of course, we are always happy to provide bathrobes upon request, and I apologize that this option wasn’t made clear during your arrival.

I also regret the delay at check-in and that your butler was on break when you arrived. We are reviewing our break schedules and enhancing our internal communications to ensure a warm, prompt welcome—especially when arrival times are confirmed in advance.
I’m glad you enjoyed your dinner and found our team’s service generally “mostly decent,” despite the brevity of your stay. Your feedback on those small lapses is invaluable and will help us raise our standards. Should you return for a longer stay, I would welcome the opportunity to personally ensure you have everything you need—from a swift check-in to uninterrupted butler service—and to arrange any activities you wish to enjoy in our eco-friendly sanctuary.

Thank you again for both your praise and your constructive comments. We hope you’ll stay with us again—perhaps for a longer break—to fully experience all that  Jetwing Vil Uyana has to offer.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Although the bedroom upstairs had an on suite toilet, the shower was downstairs.  But a first world problem, admittedly!

Weirdly for such an upscale hotel, bathrobes were not provided, especially given the remoteness of the shower from the bedroom, quite a walk!  

We only had one dinner and the food was very good

Service was not flawless but mostly decent enough.  Our room came with a butler but when we arrived (within 90 seconds of the exact time when we told them we would, in response to an earlier Whatsapp) he was on his break!  

The check-in was slow which is not what one wants after a long drive. 

We were only there one night, as a stopover to break the very long drive from the tea country to the north-east beyond Trincomalee.  So did not really have enough time to relax and enjoy the facilities. The resort is designed to be Eco-friendly, and has a spa, but we did not use so cannot comment.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed impressions of your recent stay with us at Jetwing Vil Uyana. It was a pleasure hosting you and your family, and I’m delighted to hear that you enjoyed the spacious dwelling, private pool, and the tranquil rice-field views that make our eco-lodge truly unique. I’m especially grateful for your kind words about our team’s service.

We pride ourselves on anticipating our guests’ needs—though I understand that at times our attentiveness may feel abundant. Please rest assured that your comfort and privacy are always our foremost concern, and I will speak with our colleagues to maintain the perfect balance. I also appreciate your feedback regarding wildlife sightings. While the wetlands and surrounding forests are home to crocodiles, otters, and the elusive loris, Nature is wonderfully unpredictable. I’m pleased our team was able to secure a special evening excursion so you could experience the loris firsthand. We are continually working with our wildlife guides to enhance the availability and timing of such tours and will look into expanding options for crocodile and otter spotting.

Regarding our cuisine, we strive to deliver authentic meals that showcase the richness of Sri Lankan flavors, prepared with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Our Executive Chef and I are continuously reviewing and refining our menu to introduce more signature dishes that blend traditional tastes with innovative culinary techniques. 

Finally, I understand your concerns about value for money. We strive to provide a one-of-a-kind eco-luxury experience, and your feedback is invaluable in ensuring that our rates and inclusions align with the exceptional standards we set for ourselves. I will review our packages and inclusions to see where we might better enhance the overall guest experience.

Thank you again for choosing Jetwing Vil Uyana and for your constructive comments. We would be honored to welcome you back in the future, giving us another opportunity to exceed your expectations.

Le service est irréprochable, avec un personnel toujours aux petits soins — parfois même un peu trop présent à notre goût, mais cela reste un signe de qualité.

Nous avions choisi cet établissement pour son côté “éco-lodge” et l’observation des animaux, mais nous sommes restés un peu sur notre faim : pas de crocodiles ni de loutres aperçus durant notre séjour. À notre arrivée, on nous informe que les sorties nocturnes pour voir les Loris sont complètes… Heureusement, le personnel a trouvé une solution et nous avons eu la chance d’en voir un.

Côté restauration, la cuisine était correcte, mais rien d’exceptionnel pour un établissement de ce standing.

Le vrai point négatif reste le prix, que nous avons trouvé excessif par rapport à l’expérience globale. Si le cadre est splendide, le rapport qualité-prix n’est pas totalement justifié selon nous.

Greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your stay at Vil Uyana. I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed your “magical” three-night escape with us and that you found the dwellings—nestled among the rice fields with their pools—to be both spacious and beautifully furnished. We take great pride in creating an environment where every detail contributes to a unique and memorable experience. I’m also thrilled that our restaurant, with its enchanting lake views and unforgettable cuisine, enhanced your holiday. Our team works tirelessly to ensure that every meal is a highlight, and your acknowledgment of our service being “first rate” is incredibly gratifying.

Additionally, I’m pleased to hear that Vil Uyana served as the perfect base for your research near Sigiriya. It is our constant endeavor to blend comfort and inspiration to create an experience that stays with our guests long after their journey ends.

Once again, thank you for your thoughtful words. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back for another unforgettable stay at our hideaway.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Ayubowan and warm greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana!

Thank you for taking the time to share your candid feedback. I’m truly sorry to hear that certain aspects of your stay did not fully meet the luxury standards we strive to uphold. Your comments regarding the spread-out facilities and the maintenance issues have been shared with our engineering and operations teams, who are already working to address them to ensure a smoother and more comfortable experience for all our guests.

I appreciate your remarks about our wildlife walks, and I’m delighted to know you enjoyed that aspect of your stay. Thank you for acknowledging our efforts in that area.

With regard to our culinary offerings, we do present a full variety of authentic local dishes alongside international options. We continuously seek to showcase the rich flavours of Sri Lanka, and I regret if this was not fully evident during your visit. I would welcome any specific suggestions you may have—be it particular regional specialties or preferred dishes—so that we can tailor our menus even more closely to your tastes on a future visit.

Thank you once again for your valuable feedback. We are committed to evolving and improving, and I hope you will give us another opportunity in the future to exceed your expectations.

Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed and thoughtful review. I am delighted to hear that you enjoyed the unique ambiance and natural beauty of Jetwing Vil Uyana, and that our surroundings—from the lively wildlife to the serene evenings filled with the sounds of nature—made your stay memorable.

We also appreciate your candid feedback regarding the distance from some rooms to the reception and restaurants.  To ensure our guests’ comfort, we have buggies available to assist with transportation across the property, especially along the sandy pathways. Our team is always happy to arrange a buggy for your convenience, whether for dining or exploring the grounds, particularly during inclement weather.

Thank you once again for your recommendation and for choosing Jetwing Vil Uyana. We look forward to welcoming you back for an even more refreshed and exceptional stay in the future.

We had a Garden Room which was fine but maybe a little tired. Some rooms were being upgraded while we were there so, hopefully all will get a refresh. The food was great and the whole ambience at the hotel was so peaceful. My only slight negative would be the distance from some rooms to Reception and the restaurants. It is along sandy paths and could get quite muddy if raining. Despite this, we would still highly recommend a stay at the Vil Uyana. We would like to give a very special mention to Ravi (Ravinder).

We chose 98 Acres Resort & Spa for our honeymoon, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. The resort is nestled among beautiful tea plantations with breathtaking views of Ella Gap, offering the perfect peaceful and romantic atmosphere.

Our chalet was charming and thoughtfully designed, blending beautifully with the natural surroundings. Waking up to the misty mountains and the sounds of nature was a dream. We especially loved relaxing on our private balcony — it quickly became our favorite spot to just sit back and enjoy the moment together.

A particularly memorable part of our stay was a traditional blessing ritual arranged by the resort. It was such a meaningful experience and added a lovely cultural touch to our honeymoon.

We also had complimentary access to the Ravana Pool Club, which had a great vibe and gave us the chance to unwind in a fun and relaxing setting. It was definitely a highlight of our trip!

While everything was truly special, we thought that a honeymoon cake or some romantic bed decorations could have made it feel even more personalized. Maybe it’s something the resort could offer future honeymooners.

All in all, our stay at 98 Acres was unforgettable. The staff were so warm and welcoming, and every detail was taken care of.

Ayubowan!

Thank you so much for your delightful review and for choosing 98 Acres Resort & Spa during your visit to Ella.

We’re so pleased to hear that you enjoyed the cool mountain climate, stunning views from your terrace, and the wildlife around the resort. It's wonderful to know that our location made it easy for you to explore Little Adam’s Peak and Nine Arches Bridge. Your kind words about the breakfast and the caring service — especially from Mangala — truly warm our hearts.

We’re grateful for your high recommendation and hope to welcome you back for another superb stay in the near future.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share such a detailed review of your recent family holiday with us at 98 Acres Resort & Spa.

We’re truly pleased to know you enjoyed the stunning views, spacious and thoughtfully designed rooms, and the wonderful atmosphere throughout your stay. It’s great to hear that you found the food and live music memorable and that waking up to Ella’s breath taking landscape was a highlight of your experience.

We were all so in awe of the amazing picturesque views from pretty much every area of the facility. Our rooms had endless views of the canyon and mini Adams peak. So wonderful to wake up to and have a relaxing morning on the balcony. 
The room was so well layed out and spacious. Especially the shower and being able to look at the view while enjoying the rain head shower. 
Only negative would be to put a screen on the balcony door so you have the option of leaving open to allow ventilation. Especially as there is no AC. The fan however was ok. 
The restaurant and food was outstanding. Great touch having live music every night. 
One very disappointing experience was the Pekou tour that was organised by the staff manager with their inhouse naturalist (Sam). It was for 5 of us which cost 50usd each. Very expensive but we were happy to pay for the experience. 
Unfortunately Sam did not explain too much and seemed to be in a hurry as he was always well ahead of half of us. We asked for a toilet break only to be told there was not one available. 
Towards the end we wend down a very challenging descent which was very overgrown and we all experienced scratches and irritations as we had shorts. Sam had trousers and was oblivious to this. 
We were very disappointed with Sam and his lack of attention and knowledge of the area. 
Please in future pre-warn the guests of what to expect so we could be better prepared. Overall the 3 hour walk was very enjoyable and challenging. 
This did not take away from the excellent experience at your facility.","Family Holiday Experience","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1013068312-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"960","697355377","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/29/90/cc/71/troy-b.jpg","960","201","1891","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Troydan7","Troy B","9D2C8479B696D4926C58C4ABE749657C",,"255103","Perth, Australia","Perth","Troydan7"

Ayubowan!

Thank you very much for sharing your detailed review and for celebrating your special anniversary with us at 98 Acres Resort & Spa.

We’re thrilled to know you enjoyed the breath taking views, your luxurious suite with the soaking tub, and the warm touches like the anniversary bed decoration and farewell blessing. It’s also lovely to hear that our restaurant and activities added value to your stay.

However, we deeply regret the misunderstanding during check-out regarding the face towel. Please accept our sincere apologies for any discomfort caused. We take such matters seriously and will address this with our housekeeping team to ensure such incidents are handled more sensitively in the future.

We truly appreciate your kind words and honest feedback, and we hope to welcome you back again soon for a flawless experience.

Warm regards,

Looking out over all of Ella at sunrise was such an incredible experience.

The room was also gorgeous. We stayed in a suite, and the room had a GIANT soaking tub - like took 40 minutes to fill giant. It was SO wonderful to relax in after a long day! The staff also left us a beautiful bed design to celebrate our anniversary upon check-in, which was a wonderful extra touch!

The hotel offers a lot to do and you could easily spend a few days here. The on-site restaurant was very good, and the breakfast was large and delicious.

We only had one issue during our stay. During check-out, they were so kind as to do a blessing for my husband and I, giving us each a bracelet and box of tea. Immediately following, housekeeping came up and tried to imply we stole a face towel, which we absolutely did not. And despite a few minutes of back and forth, we left feeling really weird about it.

A great experience overall.","The views!!!!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1012708224-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"705","136235467","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/08/1e/c9/cb/amyadamy.jpg","705","131","412","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyadamy","amyadamy","BD4000413605C633073597F5BCB1B757",,"42391","Lansing, Michigan","Lansing","amyadamy"

A special thank you to Ishara, who was always checking in on us, making sure everything was perfect—this clearly reflects the strength of the management team.

The restaurant team was outstanding, always attentive and friendly. We also loved the beach bar—great drinks and the perfect spot to relax. And of course, the pool quickly became our favorite hangout.

The service was exceptional - and we were incredibly well looked after by all staff we encountered during our stay. All staff were friendly and attentive, often going out of their way to make our experience unforgettable. A special mention to Sanoos in the Beach Bar, and Nipun, Madhawa, Praboda and Ashan in the main restaurant who couldn't have looked after us any better!

Die Wahl viel unter Anderem auch auf das UGA Jungle Beach Hotel, was perfekt dafür geeignet war! Das Hotel ist zwar hochpreisiger, bietet aber auch einen gewissen Gegenwert dafür. Die Lage ist am Besten als ""irgendwo im Nirgendwo"" zu beschreiben. Es liegt an einer Strasse nördlich von Trincomalee. Im Kreis von ein paar Kilometern gibt es so gut wie nichts.

Wir wurden freundlichst empfangen, unser Zimmer war zirka 1 Stunde vor offizieller Checkinzeit bezugsfertig. 
Unser 1. Zimmer ""LagoonView 42"" war noch umrenoviert, aber in Ordnung. Einzig die Klimaanlage war relativ laut und nachfolgend durch Defekt auch der Grund, warum wir noch in  ""JungleCabin27"" umgezogen sind welches gerade frisch renoviert war.  JungleCabin Zimmer sind einwenig größer in eigenen Häusern, Lagoon Zimmer haben ein Zimmer im Erdgeschoss und eines im Obergeschoss je Gebäude. 

Wir hatten Allinclusive gebucht, da das Hotel im Nirgendwo lag, eine gute Wahl, obwohl auch Halbpension gereicht hätte. Aber man gönnt es sichSämtliche Mahlzeiten AlaCart mit genügend Auswahl (Diner täglich wechselnde Karte) und IMMER optisch und geschmacklich perfekt. 

Das Personal ist ein weiterer Pluspunkt des Hotels, egal ob Kellner, Barman, Reinigung, Gästebetreuung, Beachboy usw. - alle extrem freundlich und gastorientiert.

Wir können das Hotel als eines der besten Hotels die wir weltweit besucht haben durchaus weiterempfehlen und möchten uns herzlichst beim Team des Uga Beach Hotels für die schöne Zeit bedanken.","Uga Beach Hotel - perfekt zur Erholung nach Rundreise mit sehr guter Gastronomie und Spitzenpersonal","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r1014222918-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452390619","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg","1200","4","140","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torstenk214","Torsten & Petra","AF27FB269F0864812327A109DE5E3719",,"17724903","Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Germany","Bitterfeld-Wolfen","torstenk214"

The people ❣️ I always say and it has been said that sometimes it’s not about the property but about the people who brings out the luxury of a property. The kindness, attention to detail and the genuine service.
I booked the property same day directly at the hotel as I needed to get out of the previous property that I stayed for a night only and cause I want service and a place that is well maintained. 
Jake at the reception who accommodated with the last minute was very accommodative and patient to show me the room as I needed to have a look before I complete the booking and he has been helpful through out. Nimanthi who escorted me to the room very kind and also has been accommodative during my stay. Chathuranga from housekeeping also was great with his service and nothing is ever too much. Chanil from Weligama restaurant always with a smile and go out of his way to make sure all is going well and that I am comfortable. I asked him for mangoes and he brought two types so I get to try and see which one I like best, I mean now this is service not just cause I asked but went above what has been asked ⭐️.  Dilsha such a sweet heart, lovely conversation and as a solo traveler plus a lady there is a lot that can be. I think the property is very protective, conservative at a point and make sure that you are comfortable at all times and do whatever it takes to make you feel safe.
Thank you Randula Assisstant FO Manager that connected me with Dilshan from big fish restaurant who accommodated my customized food request and to be served in the room, he was such a charm.
 I wish I could remember everyone’s name that I encounter but just know that you all played a great role and have exceeded my expectations. I mean even the security team is just so kind and you can feel their positive energy.
3 nights well spent and it’s hard to fault anything when you have such team.

Swimming Pool/Beach - the kids loved the swimming pool & loved the beach being so close. It was great they could swim in the sea & play on the beach which was clean.

Issues with late check out which was promised at time of check in and retracted the next morning until raised with the GM who kindly sorted it out. Strange experience at the pool where the staff started to close the umbrellas where we were sitting without providing any explanation. When countered they said winds are high. Strangely they closed 4-5 umbrellas and left the others almost 25 as it is. When confronted they had no answer why? Raised to the GM but did not receive any explanation till date as to why it was done selectively 

Bad experience with room service - specifically asked for 4 plates while ordering lunch and only got 3. Had to wait for another 15 mins for the 4th plate to arrive

The welcome card at the hotel is placed without writing your name. Shows how untrained the staff is 

Asked for an extra bed in the room and they said that they have zero roll away beds in hotel and can only provide spa mattress on the floor !! Very surprised that a marriott hotel keeps not even a single roll away bed in the hotel. 

Overall a nice property but disappointing experience due to staff. Staff is what makes the hotel and sadly at this property that is missing. They may take a lesson or two from nearby Sheraton property at Kosgoda where the staff are brilliant","Disappointing stay .. nice property but untrained staff","2025-06","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r1011215700-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452390416","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg","1200","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JS_29","JS_29","32D746BD0A0263270D582CBCCAC70C73",,,,,"JS_29"

The property is exceptionally clean and well-maintained, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere from the moment we arrived. The facilities available were impressive, offering everything we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.

One of the highlights was the stunning view from our room—it truly added a special touch to our visit and made our time there even more memorable. The room itself was spotless, spacious, and thoughtfully arranged, clearly maintained with a high standard of cleanliness and care.

The staff were another standout. Every team member we interacted with was friendly, professional, and eager to help. 

However, one area that could use improvement is the dining experience. While the food was generally of good quality, there was a noticeable lack of variety in the menu during our stay. After a few meals, it felt quite repetitive, and we would have appreciated more diverse options to choose from.

Overall, this hotel offers a great combination of cleanliness, comfort, excellent service, and scenic views.

A very special thank you to Lochana at the front desk – she was incredibly helpful right from the time we made our booking and continued to look after us throughout our stay. Her support and warm approach truly made us feel welcomed.

Our kids especially loved the pool activities and the Kids Club! The staff there were so friendly and engaging, keeping the little ones entertained with fun and creative activities every day. It was such a relief knowing they were in good hands while we relaxed.

The hotel interior, the view, the location, everything was impeccable. The rooms have a great view and offer a lot of different activities and games for all age groups.
But most of all we have to commend the services provided by all the staff members. We have to especially thank the kitchen team, the chef and especially Mr. Chamuditha. We are a Jain family of 11, hailing from India, with a lot of food restrictions that are generally unheard of in Sri Linka. We were able to personally coordinate all our meals with the chefs and the trainee chefs with Mr. Chamuditha as our mediator. We had a total of 6 meals at the hotel and not a single one was disappointing. They have accomodated our every need with a smiling face. Coming to Sri Lanka we were already worried about the availability of Vegetarian food let alone Jain, but we can now go back and say with surety that no such issue can occur at The Heritance.
Thank you to the whole team for making our stay such a memorable one!

That was one of it's selling points to me. I wanted a relaxing holiday and that's what I got staying here. I was very pleased with my room on the third floor, over looking the 'quiet pool' with the India Ocean in the back ground, it was a view to die for. My housekeeper Lasan kept my room very clean and tidy and entertained me each day with his towel origami and restock of bottled water.  I did have a minor issue at the beginning of my holiday in the Jutes restaurant with the waiting staff, as they are not assertive or aware enough when you sit at your table of asking you if you want water or drinks, I had to keep asking and I wasn't the only one (maybe more training needed?) but this was quickly sorted by Supervisor Chamuditha, whom I was very impressed with, by his professional manner of rectifying this issue and on my every visit to Jutes for the rest of my holiday I was well looked after by him or in his absence his colleague Supervisor Waruna. The buffet style layout is large over two areas with a lot of verity, which I found good and plentiful. I was on the All Inclusive package, which suited me, but  'Western Branded' alcohol is chargeable.  The evening entertainment was ok, but could be improved upon and there was no native entertainment. All, in all I have to say I really liked the relaxing vibe of this hotel and the staff's way of a slower pace of life, which you do have to get used to, but I do think they could take their customer service up a level, and it's not 'Western world' standard 5*, but it's very clean, comfortable and very unique in it's architecture and the staff were professional, polite, helpful and friendly.  For me personally, as a female solo traveller I felt very safe at all times.  Would I return? yes I would.","Just what I needed.","2025-03","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608521-d496623-r1001312240-Heritance_Ahungalla-Ahungalla_Galle_District_Southern_Province.html",,"718","107005565","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/06/60/c6/7d/lac1968.jpg","718","6","22","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X17LAC","X17LAC","A65ED9A241A0952C6AF4D0A10CDCBB05",,"186220","Bristol, United Kingdom","Bristol","X17LAC"

We came here largely for the safari experience - particularly to see leopards and also elephants, sloth bears, mongoose, etc in their natural environment. We have done a couple of safaris in South Africa and Botswana, and hoped this would be similar in terms of animal spotting. Unfortunately, for us, the whole experience didn’t live up to what we hoped. The safari vehicles are limited to driving on roads (unlike other parts of the world where they can go off-road) that hundreds of other jeeps/trucks of tourists were on, leading to lots of dust and few animal sightings (other than the water buffalo, peacocks and birds that are all over). Our guide explained that the animals go inside the bush away from the cars/roads (understandably). We had planned to do a 3rd safari drive, but after the first two, we cancelled the 3rd.  Of course, the hotel can’t control the crowds or ensure we saw a leopard, but having come here for the animal experience, we were disappointed with the experience. In hindsight, this was an expensive and time consuming (3 days/2 nights) part of our trip for a safari experience that for us was underwhelming. 

The hotel itself was nice, but lacked some special touches to make it truly exceptional/5 star. For example, cold towels would be a nice gesture to offer guests when they return from game drives - it’s dusty and hot out there and would be nice so we could clean our hands. The restaurant needed better ventilation/a/c - though there are a few wall a/c units and some fans, it still was very hot during lunch. Also, some fans seemed to be broken as when we asked if they could be sped up, the staff said they could not. Food itself was fine.  One time we also found that the bathrooms by the restaurant were both out of soap even though it was just 10am.  We asked the front desk for soap, but he said it would “take some time” so we instead walked back to our huts to wash our hands before returning to our breakfast. 

Staff is kind and friendly.","A bit of a let down","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1000657007-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452388669","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg","1200","47","27","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewh34","EFH","0AADF30D61AD3FB7D22348C5AF2D20D2",,"32655","Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles","matthewh34"

Uga Chena Huts is in an incredible location, beachfront with amazing views of the Indian Ocean from the bar, restaurant and the magical evening sunset bar on the beach.

Service was exceptional in all parts of the resort; check in, meal service, bar service and housekeeping were all of the highest standard with friendly, professional and well trained staff. 

There is a great variety of cocktails, spirits, wine, beer and other beverages available from the all inclusive offering, and we found the meal quality for breakfast, lunch and dinner to be of a high quality, with dietary issues / substitutions no problem at all. 

Our hut was spacious, luxurious and everything was of a high standard. 

We did two safari drives and the vehicle, drivers and guides are great. As Uga Chena Huts is so well run, it was great on a morning safari drive having the ability to drive past the 100 odd safari jeeps lined up to get into Yala National Park and enter the park straight away. 

The great location ensured plenty of animal spotting even from the resort including monkeys and a sloth bear walking across the driveway. The highlight was sitting at the bar in the evening whilst sipping wine and watching a large elephant walk through the resort illuminated by the moonlight. 

We absolutely loved our stay, our only complaint was that we only stayed for two nights and wished we had of stayed longer!","Perfection - we did not want to leave!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r1000204287-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","29","94","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petergY9057JV","Peter G","C9D25E938AD56FE83BED5F4C7AD6A68A",,,,,"petergY9057JV"

Set right by the ocean it is committed to sustainability. The room was large beautiful appointed with a private plunge pool. The food was delicious and all the staff were delightful. It has a unique setting. Each suite has a very private feel surrounded by lush vegetation. It is great to be able to walk to the edge of the grounds and look down on the sea though there is a strict no go area onto the beach due to the danger of the sea and at night the potential of wild animals. We took a day safari into Yala National Park. Our ranger from the hotel was Dush who was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and  tried to enable us to see all our top requests. The driver was particularly skilled and between them we could not have had a better team. Due to a monsoon downpour we did not see a Leopard but that only means I will have to return to this wonderful hotel. Strangely the room was a little under lit which was a bit frustrating especially after dark. Other than that it was faultless.

Everything from the moment you check in to the moment you leave is excellent.  They don’t stop feeding you and the food is first class. They also try to collect you and deliver you everywhere you want to go by golf cart so you don’t even need to walk anywhere!  Even though each ‘hut’ has a plunge pool  we used the hotel pool one morning and we were the only guests there.  It was shady and monkeys were playing in the trees for a while when we were there so it was even better.  We wanted a drink and nobody was about so we asked in the spa and a member of staff was immediately dispatched to the pool area and stayed there until we left!
Only one very small point. The lighting in the hut is quite subdued which is fine most of the time, except as a lady when you are trying to get ready to go to dinner.
A part from that it was superb and thanks to everyone for making our stay and our 2 safaris so good 😄","Everything excellent!","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r999316822-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452387495","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg","1200","0","21","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8457YQsues","Sue S","ED627C731983B920C03C081567F06E50",,,,,"X8457YQsues"

Wild Coast Tented Lodge? Outstanding. Eraeliya Weligama? Outstanding. Ceylon Tea Trails? Fantastic. Then came UGA Chena Huts—an experience so underwhelming it left us wondering how on earth this place maintains its high rating.

This is not a five-star resort. It is, at best, a three-star establishment charging luxury prices while coasting on its location and reputation. The owners have clearly decided that “good enough” is the standard, rather than investing in what could be a truly exceptional experience.

THE POSITIVES:

✔️ Spectacular location with breathtaking views over the Indian Ocean.

✔️ Kind and professional staff—they are trying their best despite what they have to work with.

✔️ Food is decent—not exceptional, but not terrible either.

✔️ Nice sundowner setting—a moment of peace before the reality of the resort kicks back in.

✔️ Beautiful beach dinner arrangements—a rare highlight.

✔️ Decent open-air bar area—nothing special, but at least functional AND OPEN …

✔️ Excellent safari rangers—if only the resort matched their level of professionalism.

THE NEGATIVES:

1. DATED, DATED, DATED.

The entire property screams neglect. This isn’t “rustic luxury” or “understated charm”—it’s just old, tired, and uninspired.

2. The Huts? Large but Utterly Soulless.

Yes, they are spacious. But space means nothing when it’s filled with boring, outdated furniture and zero atmosphere. Staying here feels more like being in a forgotten timeshare unit than a luxury retreat.

3. The Plunge Pools? A Complete Joke.

I cannot stress this enough—the so-called private plunge pools are an atrocity. Small, cheap plastic tubs, with tiny, worn-down decks that wouldn’t even be acceptable in a low-budget roadside motel. How anyone thought this was an acceptable feature for a luxury resort is beyond comprehension.

4. The Main Pool? An Absolute Misery.

Instead of using the stunning ocean views to create an infinity pool masterpiece, they’ve hidden it in the bushes. No atmosphere, no view—just an uninspired, lifeless pool area that feels like an afterthought.

5. No Proper Pool Bar – Just a Slow, Overworked Server on a Bicycle.

Want a drink by the pool? Be prepared to wait an eternity. There’s no real bar—just a lone staff member who has to bike over to fetch your order. If you’re lucky, you’ll get a beer or soda. If you want anything more complex—good luck.

6. The Dining Room? A Glass Prison.

Whoever designed the main restaurant must have hated nature, because instead of making the most of the setting, they shoved it inside a glass aquarium with AC. You can technically dine outside, but space is ridiculously limited. It’s a total mystery why a resort that markets itself as an “immersive nature retreat” has such an unwelcoming, uninspired dining experience.

7. The Food? Decent, but Laughably Boring.

For a so-called high-end resort, the lack of imagination in the menu is astonishing. And the ultimate insult? The ice cream selection: Vanilla and Chocolate. That’s it. In a country famous for tropical fruits, that’s all they could come up with?

FINAL VERDICT: A LUXURY RESORT IN NAME ONLY

Would UGA Chena Huts ever be a real five-star resort? Yes—IF the owners actually invested in it.

• The dining area? Rip out that dreadful glass box and open it up to the surroundings.

• The main pool? Move it, make it an infinity pool with ocean views, and give it a proper bar. Surround the bar and the “ new Dining area “ with an infinity pool ! Just copy what they have masterfully done elsewhere - like The Wild Coast Tented lodge 5 minutes away.

• The huts? Renovate them with actual luxury in mind, instead of letting them rot in outdated mediocrity.

• The plunge pools? Tear them out and build something worthy of the price you are  charging.

Right now, this place is a a bit of a joke. Upscale travelers aren’t stupid—they know when they’re being overcharged for mediocrity. If you want to throw your money at a subpar three-star resort disguised as a five-star experience, be my guest. But if you’re looking for true luxury, look elsewhere.","5 Star Price Tag for a 3 Star resort - issues that could so easily be fixed with money and more imagination.","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r995344051-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452390144","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stassia2024","Stassi A","68162BABA81059CFAAF730EEB0DAE696",,,,,"stassia2024"

The “huts” are expensive but worth every cent.  Cuisine (including vegetarian needs!) and choice of beverages were remarkable. There was one comment concerning toilet privacy which is true, but that can be avoided by the partner going for a swim in your own pool. 

It would be unfair to name one member of the staff for his work as they all worked together as a team and were always in for a joke. The safari tours are a must even if you don’t get to see the leopard or the famous tusk elephant, the guides and the drivers are enthusiasts all the way. Thanks.

We stayed at Una Chena Huts for 8 nights and it was absolutely fabulous.
As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff and offered a beautiful welcome drink. I knew we were going to have an amazing holiday.
One of the best holidays I have ever experienced.
The huts are beautifully appointed villas with a large pool.
The room is huge, with  a fully stocked mini bar, a massive comfortable bed, The toiletries are plentiful and there is a separate very large toilet and separate shower.
Our villa had a view of the lake where we would see our resident water buffalo who I named Bert every day just wallowing in the water keeping cool.
Every evening at 6pm we were invited for drinks at the sundowner bar on the beach overlooking the beautiful ocean.
The restaurant served amazing silver service breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The choice of food was fabulous with a choice of 4 course European  or Sri Lankan specialties.
The chef would come and say hello during dinner to ensure the meal was satisfactory.
During  our stay we were visited by an elephant walking to reception, an elephant on the beach who made his way to the restaurant and reception. Monkey family enjoying the freedom of the resort.
One particular evening on returning to the villa from a night enjoying fabulous food and drinks we were greeted by Bert our water buffalo on the porch of our villa munching on the greenery and when he was full he wandered behing our villa of our villa.
Uga Chena Huts have a fabulous team of guides who arrange and take you on the safaris. We were lucky to be offered 2 safaris a day one early in the morning and one late afternoon.
Our guide Kalihdu was absolutely fabulous, his knowledge was exceptional. He was super friendly and changed our route through the park every day.
We were so lucky to watch a leopard just chilling in the bush who then decided to sit in front of our 4x4 just relaxing and cleaning herself for 5 minutes then we had the same experience with an elephant.
It was surreal seeing these beautiful animals in the natural habitat.

It was a great amount of time - and 4 nights might just be better to thoroughly enjoy the property as well as Yala. 

The room was such a great respite after the crazy Yala drives. So much space to sprawl out. Such a comfy bed and pillows. Great shower and pressure. The deck with pool was lovely and really enjoyed hearing the waves from the ocean and the birds. Only criticism is the toilet room - it needs a roof for privacy - no one wants to hear their loved  one’s issues going on in there! 

The service was spot on! They worked so hard to make eveyone happy and cared for. A shout out to Janith our ranger - he was so knowledgeable and made the drives fun and tailored them to my needs after I said no more bumpy “main road” of Yala - so helpful! (And on that note make sure to book Spa appointments! Your sore body will thank you after those safari drives) Tea in the spa was excellent! 

The food - amazing! Always ready to cater to our needs when we needed to change it up because of preferences. I will remember the fluffy truffle eggs from breakfast forever!! Best breakfasts I’ve ever had. And the quantity of food - you will never go hungry - ever! I had to start just having soup for lunch to save room for Safari snacks which is actually just lunch to go - and so good to! 

I can’t say enough or praise the property and people enough - wonderful in every sense. Oh and an elephant even made a visit to the car park where you board the safari vehicles as well as wild boar to top it all off!

At sunset, they light a brazier on the beach and offer complimentary cocktails to watch the sun go own, with the roar of the ocean immediately adjacent.  Memories really are made of this.  The setting is utterly unspoilt and magical and surpassed our expectations.

When you find the place it is a long dirt track from the main road (which is quite normal in Sri Lanka) and Uga Chena is at the end past the Hilton, Cinnamon and a couple of other places down this road.  

So glad we picked the Uga Chena though as we could not fault it.  From the amazing HUGE room to the warm, friendly, helpful, brilliant team working there.  Uga have a few hotels throughout Sri Lanka and they vary greatly in price and facilities, Uga Chena is up there on price, but what you get is unparalleled and we had quite an adventure just in our 3 days there.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed most warmly and felt at home straight away.  As we walked to the restaurant a monitor lizard was fishing in the pond and caught a fish which was amazing to watch.  

The restaurant is small and intimate with aircon indoor seating and covered outdoor seating available.  There is an outdoors bbq where some items are prepared - the food is freshly prepared each day and the menu changes dependent upon what they have fresh that day.  My favourite was the lobster and Kris’s was the steak. But the curries are all delicious.

We had a culinary demonstration which was a treat and the prawn curry chef cooked was delicious.  

The outside bar and ‘sundowner’ bar are a treat with the bar close to the restaurant and the sundowner out near the beach, the weather and animals do not always allow the sundowner to operate, so go there when you can.  

The room is simply amazing - you will not be disappointed.  The bed is enormous, you can both starfish.  toiletries and amenities are plentiful with separate toilet and shower (excellent pressure), large bath, twin sinks and great aircon. The minibar is well stocked and replenished whenever you wish.  Try the ‘whispering wall’ - if you both stand in opposite corners and talk quietly to the wall, you can hear perfectly - or better still surprise your partner with this knowledge when they are in the toilet :).

The room has an outdoor pool - this is not heated so brace yourself.  But the view from it is perfect.

Our personal experience was quite the adventure even for just 3 nights that we were there.  We had 3 safaris booked and were paired with a very warm and friendly Australian family who we made friends with straight away.  Our Ranger ‘Gayan’ and his driver were absolute diamonds - so helpful and knowledgeable, spotting animals we wouldn’t even with binoculars. Our first trip out was leisurely until they received word of a possible leopard sighting - but it had gone when we got there.  On the way, we saw plenty though and were very happy with our journey.  Our second trip was early morning and we were treated the most magical hour or more when we saw a leopard taking a nap in a tree and watched her for as long as she sat there watching us, licking her paws.  

That night we were held hostage by an elephant who decided that the trees outside our villa were the best in Sri Lanka and we were unable to leave.  So we turned off the lights, made good use of the minibar and sat watching the magnificent beast as he completely ignored the rangers combined attempts to move him on.  We got to dinner about 9.30pm and could not have been happier!  We were treated to the brilliant service they offer none-the-less for our late arrival and the story of the elephant in camp was doing the rounds.  While we were at dinner, he moved on to the staff accommodation and they found themselves unable to go back till he had moved on - I hope they had a ‘lock-in’.  :) and enjoyed it.

Whilst we were there in January and the weather was a little against us with sporadic rain, we made the most of this magical place and the wonderful staff who looked after us.  On the morning that we were leaving, we went on a beach walk with our Ranger and our Antipodean friends and were again treated to the most magical walk on the beach.  We saw the recent prints of Leopard, Elephant, Sloth Bear and mongoose - all of which had travelled through camp during the night - incredible.  The most surprising was the sloth bear and it made up for not having seen him on our safari.  There are a couple of stray dogs here but they really don’t bother you.  

Animals we saw were:- Elephant, Leopoard, Buffalo, Boar, Chipmunks, Peacocks, Monkeys, Monitor Lizards, Gecko, lizards of all sorts, Birds too many to mention and crocodile.","Simply stunning","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r989559119-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"2048","670564226","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/27/f7/ff/82/caption.jpg","2046","68","111","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheHunterClan","El about town","38889EA19DADCA67DCE0A5AAE63EEDF6",,"186342","Norwich, United Kingdom","Norwich","TheHunterClan"

I stayed in the hotel for one night for full board basis. I would specially like to thank Bositha for all the arrangements and handling our booking in the hotel. I got to know him by a friend as the front office manager of the hotel and he did his job perfectly just as my friend told me. Himasha handled our reservations in the hotel arrival and he did his job really well. Talking about the rooms, it was clean and comfortable and the balcony is facing the sea which adds a nice view. They also have a restaurant and a pool in the roof top. We had a buffet for breakfast and set menu's for lunch and dinner. The meals were perfectly prepared and they gave us options to select in the set menu's. I would also like to mention the service provided in the restaurant since thet handled their guests in the best way. I would recommend the hotel to my friends too since the staff is friendly and the service provided was exceptional. So finally, I could say that if anyone is searching a hotel in negombo to relax, have a good meal and spend time in the beach Regal Rèseau is a perfect selection for it.","A comfortable stay in Negombo beach side","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d19140639-r1014853033-Regal_Reseau_Hotel_Spa-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452389009","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg","1200","0","12","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yashodaa904","Yashoda Aravinda","1BC50726D86FF171E65DCD44DA0B89DD",,"297897","Negombo, Sri Lanka","Negombo","yashodaa904"

Too many great people to mention, but Priyangi stands out for her super service, and hardwork. 

I recommend the sweet potato. It's cooked to perfection. 

Instead of using baked beans from a can, the Chef hand cooks black eye peas instead, which are so much better than canned beans. 

The pickled veg is amazing: I eat that all the time. 

You have to visit the Camelot. It's the best in Sri Lankan cuisine and service.

The location itself was beautiful, and the food was great, making it an ideal spot for a laid-back day. However, our experience was unfortunately marred by a few issues with the staff, particularly at the bar.

There was a staff member named Nishantha who, unfortunately, left a negative impression. His manner of speaking to customers was unprofessional, and it felt like he was treating us poorly. We were simply asking for an afternoon snack, but instead of helping, he directed us to different locations and asked us to join a queue for an event hosted by another company. When we followed his instructions, we were then told that we could not get the snack, and were sent back to the bar. This back-and-forth felt confusing and frustrating.

When we tried to explain the situation to Nishantha, his response was dismissive and rude, making us feel as though we were begging for something that should have been a simple request. We were visiting Sri Lanka from the UK, and my sister and her family came all the way from Australia. This visit was meant to be a special memory for us, but the lack of proper training and communication from certain staff members really took away from the experience.

It’s such a shame, because with the right customer service, this could have been a truly wonderful day. We hope the hotel provides more training to its staff on how to properly communicate and treat guests, especially in a place with such a strong reputation.","Nice location","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r999227559-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391441","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247nadeeshan","Nadeesha N","CCDA2D00229BADF7737095FC06EE3139",,,,,"247nadeeshan"

Service was good, pleasant staff and surroundings. The breakfast was ok, the fresh fruit didn't seem that fresh and some of the bread wasn't nice to eat. Not the best breakfast buffet we've ever had.
We had a couple of snacks by the pool during our stay, but they were not brought with napkins (finger foods need napkins).","Good for 2 nights","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r998439647-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"364","32110061","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e9/f5/ed/onlyonesue.jpg","550","179","1700","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueWithaView","SueWithaView","30370A285E1C2371ABDB76C6AB9ABB02",,"499500","Melbourn, United Kingdom","Melbourn","SueWithaView"

I feel sad that I did not go through some of the reviews, due to lack of time , before I book.
I checked in on the 25th February in Camelot Beach for a stay of 3 nights.

Check In: As soon as I arrive at around 16hrs, I was offered to take a seat with a welcoming drink.
My passport was collected for the formalities.
After about 10-15 mins, I was still waiting for someone to come and check me in.
Surprisingly there were no other guests at  Reception, the staff were talking among themselves or looking at he computer.
When I was about to go and enquire if the check in would last long, I saw a bus arriving with about 10 persons.
Immediately, all the staff left their desk to welcome those guests while I was still waiting.
When they went back to their desk I went to see the staff telling them that I`ve been waiting for quite some time now.
Finally, the formalities were completed and was being accompanied to the room after making the full payment for the 3 nights.

Room: No seaview from inside, you have to go the balcony to see the view.
When I asked the staff who accompanied me for a better seaview and a double bed instead of 2 single beds, I was told that the hotel is full and it was not possible but to check the next morning.
I was not only shocked by this answer because for a hotel which claims to be top notch , I would have expected an answer like "" I will check and revert back to you shortly""
Then I remembered that some hotels will only take your money irrespective of offering the service you have paid for.
Some hours ago, 2 of my friends called me from Hikkaduwa and wanted to come to Negombo for about 6 nights. I told them that the hotel is full here and that they would rather book another hotel.
They started laughing, there were about 6 rooms available on Booking.Com, which means that there were also some other rooms available for direct bookings!
How can people lie to that extent? This attitude prevents the resort from selling the rooms because of the staff.
The owner should look into asap it as I do not trust the management over there to do something.
Dinner: Went to the main restaurant for dinner. After going around the buffet, I asked one of the Chefs if I could order form A La Carte , the buffet was limited in terms of vegetarian options.
He said ok , asked me to go and have  a seat while he will bring over the menu.
I waited and waited, neither the Chef nor the menu came. Both were no shows. 
Finally I had to ask a waiter if he could assist me, which he kindly did by bringing me the menu and  taking my order.
BTW, I saw the same  Chef in the restaurant during breakfast, he tried to avoid all eye contact with me. 

Before going to breakfast, I went down to Reception to inform them I would upgrade my meal plan to Bed and Breakfast at US D 10 per day for the 3 days.
However, the Front Office Manager who by the way does not have any sense of customer service came in and rudely said that the hotel will apply a higher price (around US D 15) which I declined since it was written black on white USD 10 per night per day.
I even showed him screen shot of that. The only thing he could do is to take leave instead of sorting out the situation.
I am sure a line staff could do better than him.
He said in that case, I would better talk to the GM. I said Ok, please call him or her. Surprisingly, she was in a meeting. 
I was told that she would contact me later.
I waited in vain.
Finally, I went out for a trip and came back at  16h30.

I took the decision to leave this hotel after only 1 night despite having already paid for 3 nights.
I wanted to have peace and stay in a serene place. W

When checking out from that resort, surprisingly everybody started to feel concerned (Receptionist to the Front Office Manager).
I told them I was leaving due to the appalling service that they deliver.

One advice to the Management or owners: Please send your staff to have proper training in hotels like The Kingsbury`s  in Colombo or Jetwing Sea which is not far from where you are situated.

Be careful while booking this hotel. Personally, I will never go again and recommend.","Never Ever again","2025-02","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r996836272-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,,,,,"0","4","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandp2017","Sand P","348A9A8DB58E21D63D3253B3AC90F0DB",,,,,"sandp2017"

Нам к сожалению, досталось крыло над ресепшеном, ремонт посредственный. (но вид от туда прямой на океан ♥) Белые стены, тёмная мебель - классическая Азия.
Вежливый персонал, тут даже нет вопросов! Все проблемы решались достаточно быстро. На 2х взрослых и ребенка 10 лет хотели дать маленький номер, но  без ругани и доплат изменили на семейный.
Не плохое расположение. Рядом магазины, улочка для прогулок, до центра и рыбачьего рынка около 300 км прогуляться или 100 руб на тук-туке.
Завтрак и ужин был разнообразным и вкусным, по выходным живая музыка, открытый ресторан у бассейна за доп оплату. Мясо, рыба, креветки - вся еда в достатке. Огромный выбор десертов.
немного смутила концепция ужина без напитков. Даже сок, вода в бутылке или лимонад только через официанта за доп оплату. 
Услуги отеля соответствовали заявленному уровню. Есть СПА, но мы не посещали. 
2 Бассейна на протяжении нашего отпуска были чистые. Пляж общественный, но сотрудники отеля следили и каждое утро мы видели, что его обирают. 
По вечерам на пляже собирается местная молодежь, играют в футбол и волейбол, к туристам не лезут. Торговцы перестают донимать после 2-3х отказа в шопинге (тот же товар в магазине у отеля в 2 раза дешевле)
На счёт уборки - её делают, бельё меняют. Но уборка не всегда качественная. Воду приносят ежедневно по 0,5 литра на человека. В целом отель приличный для не слишком привередливых туристов.","приемлемо для Азии","2025-02","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r996724415-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452387929","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg","1200","0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_V1130HZ","Калинина С","EBD6BEEC4882947F5CF08A271D4A2EC4",,,,,"_V1130HZ"

The view from the property is absolutely breathtaking — peaceful and serene. It’s also a great location for adventure lovers, with hiking to Little Adam’s Peak nearby, plus a swing and zipline experience right next to the hotel.

All the staff were friendly and helpful, and even during our departure, the hospitality was excellent. However, we did face a small issue with the shuttle service for dinner. Despite calling in advance as instructed, the shuttle was not sent. After waiting, we had to walk. I reported the issue to the manager, who kindly assured me that they are working to improve their standards and ensure this doesn’t happen again.

The highlights for us were the food and the spa. They offer a really good selection of Sri Lankan cuisine—elevated just enough to feel special, but still authentic and full of Sri Lankan hospitality. It’s also reasonably priced. If you’re not in the mood for Sri Lankan food, their Western options are also excellent. I recommend the Eggs Benedict.

The spa area has beautiful views, and it’s a lovely place to relax while being pampered. Again, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the experience.

Suggestions for the hotel: It would be great if the hotel offered some excursions in their brochure, like private tours to nearby waterfalls or small adventures to make the most of the area.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We're glad to hear you appreciated the warm welcome and the blessing ceremony, and that you found the location convenient for exploring attractions like the Nine Arches Bridge.

However, we understand that preferences vary, and we will look into how we can better communicate this on our website. We also appreciate your suggestion regarding maps for walking routes and will work on providing clearer directions for our guests.

We had an unforgettable honeymoon at 98 Acres Resort & Spa. From the moment we arrived, the warm hospitality stood out. The staff greeted us with a traditional ""Aarathi"" ceremony, setting a serene tone for our stay.

We chose the Royal Deluxe Cabana on a bed and breakfast basis. The accommodation was a blend of rustic charm and modern comfort, featuring eco-friendly designs with thatched roofs and furniture. The balcony offered panoramic views of the lush tea plantations and the majestic Little Adam’s Peak and Ella rock. 

A highlight of our stay was the complimentary sunrise tour arranged by the hotel. Accompanied by a knowledgeable guide, we trekked to the top of Little Adam’s Peak. The sight of the sun rising over the misty mountains was truly magical—a moment we'll cherish forever.

Dining at Restaurant 98 was a delight. We enjoyed a diverse breakfast buffet with both Western and Sri Lankan dishes, including the must-try egg hoppers. The setting, overlooking the verdant landscape, made each meal special.","Overall, 98 Acres Resort & Spa provided a perfect blend of nature, luxury, and cultural immersion.","2025-05","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1010139152-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"1024","806352946","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/30/0f/f8/32/sageerthan7.jpg","1024","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sageerthan7","Sageerthan","BC1CB198F1D281A01989A33065AC7EEA",,,,,"Sageerthan7"

He was the absolute best activities organiser for the Kids we’ve ever encountered. 

From the moment we arrived he had the kids smiling and from sun up to sun down they were entertained with creative arts, board games in the games rooms, themed adventures and outdoor play including cricket and volleyball. 
Every day the kids came back with huge smiles each day full of stories, smiles, and excitement. 

The activities were thoughtfully planned and age-appropriate, balancing creativity, learning, and fun perfectly and we loved that it included many local childhood games that Rutchira played as a child.  

His energy, smile, warmth and genuine care for the children was immediately apparent. He went above and beyond to create a safe, engaging, and joy-filled environment where every child felt special and included.

If you have children and are looking for somewhere to go as a family then I highly recommend recommend this resort as Rutchira will make you feel like family.

The rest of the staff were incredible also.  The rooms were cleaned each morning with great care and fresh water supplied at a call whenever we needed it.  A special mention also to Rupan who had laid out our towels each morning at the pool in our preferred location without even having to ask and he knew our names from day one.  He always had a lovely smile for us.","Paradise location with Fantastic staff","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1006392191-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",,"2422","407629222","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/4b/ed/a6/jtzil.jpg","2422","1","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jtzil","JTZIl","5AC73048F05CD5F573E8022FED3E7E69",,"255060","Sydney, Australia","Sydney","Jtzil"

Wer möchte kann Wasseraktivitäten buchen. Haben wir allerdings nicht gemacht. 

Das Essenangebot ist vielfältig. Wir haben à la Card gegessen. Es gibt aber auch Buffet. 
Im Umkreis sind einige weniger Restaurants ebenfalls erreichbar. 

Erwähnen möchte ich auch das ayurvedische Spa-Angebot. Auch hier sind kompetente und freundliche Mitarbeiter tätig. Ich kann die Fußreflexzonen-Massage besonders empfehlen. 

Fazit: Wir kommen gerne noch einmal länger wieder!","Ausgezeichneter Service in tollem Hotel","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1003703450-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",,"1588","799719617","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2f/aa/c0/c1/caption.jpg","2048","0","9","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499violas","Viola S","BDA865A6BA0AAB1C6181F9FB02EACE20",,,,,"499violas"

Пассикуду выбрала по рекомендации знакомых - в апреле там нет волны. Отель выбрала по отзывам на сайте. Все правда. Отель замечательный. Очень компактный- на 40 номеров, номера большие, с верандой, ванная комната так вообще потрясение. Просто огромная. Все есть: халаты, тапочки, гель, крем, шампунь - на масляной основе, кожу не сушит. Номера убирали ежедневно, приходили еще вечером , узнать, нужно ли добавить воды, чая, кофе. Я брала завтраки и ужины. Этого достаточно. Кормили вкусно: ланкийская кухня и европейская. Мясо, рыба, фрукты, сладости, мороженое - ежедневно. Официанты работали отлично. 
Пляж песчаный, 50 метров от номера. Лежаков в избытке. Народу немного, очень комфортно. Аниматор ежедневно агитировал народ на волейбол, развлекал детей. Скучно не было. 
Массажистам из СПА- особая благодарность. Достойный массаж, ежедневно бесплатная йога, можно и масочки поделать, и паровую ванну принять и все это с маслами аюрведческими. 
Персонал очень доброжелательный, как будто я родственница, которую очень ждали в гости. 
В самой Пассикуде смотреть и брать нечего, но основные туристические локации рядом, часа на 2-3 пути ( по меркам Шри Ланки): Сигирия, Элла, Канди, 9-ти арочный мост.

 What an amazing hotel. Can't say how much we enjoyed our 7 day stay here. It was our 30th wedding anniversary.
All staff were so helpful,and attentive, they went above and beyond.
 When we arrived we virtually had the pool and beach to ourselves. We walked the bay both ways. A huge plus point is there are no beach sellers.
 The three hour snorkelling trip was excellent value for money  organised via the hotel. My husband went on the bike tour,which he thoroughly enjoyed.
The spa was  great . Third time in Sr Lanka, and I can honestly say I will return to this hotel.

Overall, the stay was good with good facilities. However, the service was poor. The hotel was big and felt very impersonal compared to other hotels we stayed at during our trip to Sri-Lanka such as Jetwing Surf, Heritance Kandalama, Maalu Maalu Resort & Spa. 
Of note was check-in and the provision on tea bags during the breakfast buffet. 
Check-in was a nightmare; there was no one directing our party to a check-in counter nor was there an area resembling a check-in counter. It looked more like a fish market, crowded with people. We had to move across to different ""desks"" 3x times to get someone to attend to us as people kept pushing through. A trolley of welcome drinks was brought, presumably for us however, a group of people walking past grabbed them.

Sri-Lanka has great tea and all other hotels we stayed at provided freshly brewed pots of delicious tea during the breakfast service. At Weligama however, a tea bag was offered with hot water. There were 2 staff members at the tea/coffee station however, I could not figure out exactly why they needed 2x staff members to provide tea bags and bad coffee. If these aspects could be improved this could be a more welcoming hotel.","Relatively good experience however, service needs improvement","2025-04","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r1004188266-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389422","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","1200","0","5","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nimh2025","Nim H","2081B4FCFA6436CE7B9D0DD9A18C1A6B",,,,,"nimh2025"

Thank you sincerely for your heartfelt review.

We are delighted to know that your experience with us was “simply exceptional” from the moment you arrived. 

 We are fortunate to have such passionate associates who take great pride in delivering personalized service that reflects the Marriott Bonvoy spirit.

We’re equally pleased that you had a chance to embrace the natural beauty of Weligama’s surf-friendly shores and panoramic views from our seafront rooms. Your note on consistency between our outlets is well taken and appreciated—we’re always looking for ways to fine-tune the guest experience.

Thank you once again for choosing Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa. We look forward to welcoming you back for another memorable stay by the ocean.

Iresh’s warm and attentive manner immediately set the tone, with a special touch in recognizing our Marriott Bonvoy status. Lochana, at the front desk, made sure we were always updated on daily events, adding a personal touch that enhanced our stay.

Now, let’s talk about the food—simply outstanding! The Sri Lankan dishes were bursting with flavor, from the vibrant sambol to the deliciously varied vegetable accompaniments. Whether you’re craving traditional Sri Lankan flavors or international cuisine, this hotel caters to all. The spread includes a fantastic Chinese-Asian station, an Indian station, and a pan-European station. It’s clear that the hotel’s culinary team is focused on providing a diverse, high-quality experience that meets nearly every guest’s needs.

The hotel’s beach is another highlight, renowned for its prime surfing conditions. Weligama’s beach is perfect for beginner surfers, and it offers plenty of other activities. Even if the food at the hotel could become repetitive for some, it absolutely doesn’t here. There’s always something new to try, and the quality remains top-notch throughout our stay.

If I were to pick a minor gripe, it would be the inconsistency in offers between the lobby outlet and poolside outlets. A little uniformity across the board could help boost revenue, but this is a very minor issue in an otherwise stellar stay.

A big thank you to Marriott Weligama for delivering a remarkable experience. The hotel truly lives up to the Marriott Bonvoy brand. Special thanks to Iresh, Lochana at reception, and the amazing Nazmi and Dushan at the restaurant who went above and beyond to make our stay extraordinary. And of course, the views from the seafront rooms are absolutely breathtaking!

You can literally walk next door for friendlier service, better food, and better prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I rarely write negative reviews (have a look at my review history), but our current experience at this hotel is so disappointing and unacceptable!

From the moment we arrived, it was clear that we weren't going to receive the same treatment as other guests. While everyone else checking in was warmly welcomed with refreshing beverages, we weren't even offered water. We waited 3 hours for our room and had to purchase overpriced drinks and food from the hotel during our wait. The service during our 3 hours of waiting was painfully slow and the staff forgot almost every order (a drink each - 4 people, and 3 simple meals) 

Although we had requested an early check-in months in advance, we only discovered upon arrival that this couldn't be accommodated, which I understand can happen. However, what was unacceptable was the complete lack of basic hospitality, respect and information - no welcome,  no offer of welcome drinks being passed around to other guests right in front of us, no offer of water, no information about breakfast times or hotel services. 

I must mention that they were EXTREMELY quick and efficient with making us pay upfront before any kind of room was available (and still hadn’t even been offered a sip of water). 

I brought it up to a few staff members during our wait for our rooms, including while the welcome drinks were being passed around to others, but I was dismissed with an “ah sorry about that” but still no offer of water even! The rudeness was disgraceful! 

When our room was finally ready, our bags were delivered to our friends' room instead of ours, forcing us to transport them across to our room ourselves.

The problems continued at breakfast when our ordered omelettes were given to another table. Throughout our stay so far, everything is overpriced for the quality received, and the unacceptable rudeness is continuing. 

The most frustrating aspect is the manager's behaviour. He was incredibly rude, consistently spoke over me when I tried to address our concerns, and later seemed to ""disappear"" despite multiple requests to speak with him. Zero apologies were offered for any of these issues or inconveniences we’ve faced so far.

While I can understand that early check-in requests can't always be accommodated, the rudeness from senior staff was completely unacceptable. 

For the price point of this hotel, so far the service is falling FAR below expectations. Usually we would spend a lot of time at the hotel, use the spa services, eat at the restaurants, and get the majority of our drinks from the hotel bars. I will not spend any extra money at this place right now. Us and our friends are making a point to eat and drink elsewhere, as well as use spas not associated with the hotel during our current visit. 

I wouldn't stay here again and cannot recommend it to others based on our experience. There are far better hotels close by.","Disappointing Stay So Far - Poor Service and Unwelcoming Atmosphere","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r1000383862-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"784","571853122","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/22/15/c9/42/andrealo5218li.jpg","784","7","73","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreaL0123","Andrea O","F385F4867A8114EA1DE9C7A27DA4AB23",,"295424","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai","andreaL0123"

Очень нравится расположение, отличный пляж Велигама, чтобы позаниматься серфингом. Персонал вежливый и улыбчивый, стараются реагировать на любую просьбу. Расположение номеров отличное! Вид на море, но скорее всего выше 4 этажа без дополнительной оплаты вас не заселят)

Из минусов - совсем непонятно, что случилось с завтраком. Мы в целом любим еду почти из любого корнера.  Но индийский прям таки на любителя. Азиатский корнер почти всегда холодный. Блюда вроде только поставили, но мясо остывшее. Европейский корнер однообразный и скудный( одно и то же каждый день и выбора мало. Овощей мало. Каждый день помидоры и огурцы, а салаты с сосискам это совсем такое себе:( насчет сыра, ну сделайте вы нарезку, ну неужели вас доставляем удовольствие, как гости одной рукой пытаются откромсать кусочек сыра от огромного куска..? Что за мода такая? 
Обслуживание у бассейна оставляет желать лучшего. Никак нельзя вызвать официанта. Только если вы заказываете блюда, а выбор блюд и напитков по куакоду на зонтике крайне ограничен. Большей части того, чего бы хотелось там нет. Нужно идти самому и нести из бара.  Уборка посуды после очень плохая. Стакан может стоять пустой 4 часа на жаре, его никто не заберет.. куда девать посуду вообще не понятно. 
Хотело бы, чтобы сотрудники отвечающие за зону бассейна действительно ей интересовались. Куча детей (и взрослых) ныряют с бортиков, игнорируя нормальный спуск в бассейн.. но вместо этого, сотрудники бронируют с вечера на следующий день лежаки для некоторых гостей. Это не правильно. 
Уборка номеров от случая к случаю производит хорошее впечатление. На лоджии не убираются все ем. Волосы предыдущих гостей продолжают там клоками валяться. Полы грязные. На двоих человек чаще всего в номе оставляют 2 бутылки воды и 3 полотенца, одно из которых маленькое.

The true appreciation for this property however is that is on a WONDERFUL beach that is one of the best areas to learn surfing.   The Sand on the Beach is better than Dominican republice or Cuba or Cancun....and it must carry out atleast 2hundreed feet so that you are at most chest high.

Saw a giant turtle...and went for a local Ayervedic Massage.

I recently stayed at Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa from 27th January to 30th January 2025 excellent property & stay was very good only thing what was disappointing was we experienced serious issues regarding food mislabelling. As strict vegetarians (no eggs, meat, or fish), we trust reputed hospitality brands to maintain the highest standards, but our experience was deeply disappointing.

1. Mislabelling of Thai Curry as Vegetarian

On the day of check-in, we ordered food through in-room dining. My daughter explicitly informed the staff that we are strict vegetarians and requested Vegetarian Thai Curry with Rice.

The staff initially mentioned that the Thai Curry contained prawn sauce. However, a senior staff member later confirmed this after escalation.

That evening, at Weligama Kitchen, we noticed the same Thai Curry incorrectly labelled as Vegetarian. When my daughter questioned the chef, he confirmed it contained prawn sauce and admitted it was a mistake after consulting another chef.

2. Egg Used in 'Vegetarian' Hopper (Appam)

On 30th January, during breakfast, I requested a Vegetarian Hopper. The chef responded, ""No Veg,"" and demonstrated by showing me an egg, stating that eggs are used in the dough.

Despite this, the dish was labelled as Vegetarian. When I took a photo of the name card, the chef panicked and called Chef Murtuza, who tried to dismiss the situation as a ""miscommunication."" However, given the chef’s direct statement and demonstration, this was not a miscommunication but clear mislabelling.

We are strict vegetarians, and this misinformation is not only misleading but deeply offensive to our religious beliefs.
My daughter has severe allergies, and such mistakes could have led to serious health complications.

The casual attitude of the staff over three days raises serious concerns about whether the vegetarian food served was genuinely vegetarian.

We chose Marriott expecting the highest hospitality standards, but this experience has been extremely disappointing. We request:

1. Immediate corrective action to ensure vegetarian food is properly labelled and prepared separately.

2. Proper staff training to prevent such serious mistakes in the future.

Mislabelling of Food was disappointing, I would like to appreciate Chef Naveen, Chef Ruvini, and Nazmi for their excellent service and attentiveness.

Additionally, I would like to caution vegetarians traveling to Sri Lanka—please be careful. It is essential to speak directly with a chef who understands proper English and clearly state No Egg, Fish, or Meat to ensure food is genuinely vegetarian.","Vegetarians Be Careful serious issue of Food Mislabelling.","2025-01","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r992370686-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"50","293617885","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/80/40/dd/nbmehta194.jpg","50","0","22","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nishith1904","Nishith Mehta","57F8431F08265D71C6CE3609DAB02E05",,"304554","Mumbai, India","Mumbai","nishith1904"

Warmest greetings from Jetwing Vil Uyana.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. Please allow me to express my deepest apologies for the distress caused during your stay due to the presence of bats in your room. I can only imagine how unsettling and disruptive this must have been for you. Your understanding and patience in allowing our team to address the matter mean so much to us, and I am truly sorry for the inconvenience you endured.

As a sanctuary that celebrates the harmony between nature and hospitality, our resort is surrounded by the breathtaking beauty of Sri Lanka’s wilderness. While this connection to nature is something we hold dear, I completely understand that encountering wildlife in such close proximity to your accommodations can be uncomfortable. I want to assure you that we are constantly striving to strike a better balance, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us refine our preventive measures.

I also want to personally apologize if my response during this situation did not meet your expectations. It was never my intention to downplay your experience, and I am deeply sorry if my words or actions caused additional distress. Please know that your comfort and satisfaction are at the heart of everything we do, and your comments are a reminder of the care and attentiveness every guest deserves.

Despite this unfortunate incident, I sincerely hope that you were able to find moments of peace and joy in the serene beauty and unique character of Jetwing Vil Uyana. We are incredibly grateful for your trust in choosing us and for sharing your thoughts so openly. It is my heartfelt hope that we will have the privilege of welcoming you back in the future for a stay that is not only restful but truly exceptional in every way.

Ayubowan! (May you live long!)

Spectacular location, large rooms with character, good food, helpful staff - all positive. However, we were unlucky. One evening, returning to our room after dinner, we found bats flying around inside. Staff were helpful in removing them, but they soon found their way back in. Staff came three times to remove them and to try to block up where they were coming in - they were great - but I was still up at 3.30pm getting bats out of the room myself. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked and we could only change rooms the following day. I accept these things happen. What didn't impress me, however, was the attitude of the general manager, who showed virtually no sympathy and empathy. He made light of the matter, almost laughing it off. There was no gesture of goodwill, financial or otherwise. Having slept only two hours that night, we were obviously exhausted for the next few days and it took the edge off our trip. A hotel is only as good as its general manager - can't recommend.","Bats in our room all night - no understanding or sympathy from the general manager","2025-03","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304141-d642314-r998887499-Jetwing_Vil_Uyana_A_Luxury_Reserve-Sigiriya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452386713","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg","1200","0","3","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/735philipo","Philip O","21F232C76243E08083825192D9148F9B",,,,,"735philipo"

The staff and management were very accommodating to all of my remote work and cabin requests. They were happy to accommodate anything I asked to change. The hotel has a very natural common area with a pool, restaurant and bar area where I was able to work. The food was excellent especially if you enjoy seafood. The juice and deserts, jams and butter all made with fresh fruits and tasty ingredients. The staff was happy to give me as much food as I wanted and to taste and have small bites, could modify orders as I liked. I highly recommend this place for a true getaway into nature, away from city life. The naturalist Ashan was super genuine, knowledgeable and helpful about all sightseeing and nature excursions in Trincomalee and across Sri Lanka. He even helped me plan the rest of my trip moving to other cities. I arrived by cinnamon air from Colombo to Trincomalee airport which was super easy and fun, and Uga hotel sent me a driver to pick me up from the landing strip and take me to the hotel. There are lovely beaches, snorkeling and temples in the area which the hotel took me to, including seeing lots of amazing dolphins, turtles, colorful corals and fish. I loved how flexible it was every evening I would talk to reception and the naturalist and we found something fun and different that I could go do the best day according to my work/time off schedule. Staff and management super kind and nice.","The true nature experience in Trincomalee","2025-06","SOLO","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r1011460606-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452386314","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628ranar","Rana R","095D200180C887D6FFC5BEF824AE65C1",,,,,"628ranar"

We had an incredible stay at Uga Jungle Beach for my 30th birthday. We stayed for 5 nights and the stay can be surmised into 3 points: exceptional service, exceptional food, premium feel.

The staff were all extremely friendly and no request was too difficult to sort. They work long hours and maintain the high quality consistently. A good example of their forward thinking was to do the room cleaning whilst you’re at breakfast and dinner so you don’t have the awkward moment returning to your room to find someone midway through cleaning!

We were half board and experienced a la carte dining. For each of our 5 days we had a different menu for a 5 course dinner (starter, soup, sorbet, entree, desert). Dishes were superbly prepared and presented and tasted superb. Breakfast was also an a la carte experience with juice options, 3 different dishes out of a large menu (we only ever had 2 as they were very filling).

On my birthday my wife surprised me with a sunset seafood bbq on the beach, organised by Uga. This was the main highlight of the holiday for me - the food was exceptional, both in quality and quantity (tuna, crab, lobster, prawns, cuttlefish, white fish, vegetables, rice etc) - we even got a private fire pit! They put lots of effort into the sand decorations too.

Only minor thing was the drinks were on the pricier end but that’s to be expected when travelling to a premium hotel. As a reference a lion lager (330ml) was around £5. We have been to restaurants / hotels where a 625ml bottle was £2. By UK prices £5 is still good. Be aware the menu prices are listed in USD - there is then a service charge (10%) and local tax (18-20%) on top of the listed price. At the time of writing this, the conversion to GBP means the listed price is basically what it costs in GBP when you add the service + tax.

We also chose to go on a guided cycling tour (3 hours - £32) with a private naturalist - this was around 20km and involved seeing many of the 400+ bird species in Sri Lanka (thanks Ashan!). If you like nature and the beautiful rice field landscapes then this excursion is a must do in our opinion.

On site itself there are so many varieties of wildlife - monkeys regularly sat above our balcony (Jungle cabin). We also do giant squirrels, crabs, 3 different species of kingfisher, loads of other birds.  

The beach is completely idyllic, we ran 2km either side and didn’t encounter another human being - it is fully secluded. The water is beautiful, calm, warm and there is a lifeguard on duty. We found that the water remained chest height up to around 15-20 meters from the shore so was ideal for paddling and swimming.

We hope to return in the future - thanks for the amazing stay.","Idyllic beach resort with exceptional food and staff","2025-06","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3576786-d3236090-r1011082254-Uga_Jungle_Beach-Kuchchaveli_Eastern_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","1","50","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliecox31","charliecox31","D99D93A6288D628AC5BF7AC4950315B7",,"7806066","Milton, United Kingdom","Milton","charliecox31"

Kushan at the front desk – from the very first moment, he made it his mission to ensure we felt comfortable and welcomed. Throughout our entire stay, he offered warm, personal, and attentive care. Every request was met with sensitivity, respect, and a genuine desire to help.
Bositha from the management office – for his professionalism, kindness, and willingness to assist at any time and with any request.
Pushpita, the wonderful masseuse – truly relaxing, professional, and personalized treatment.
Dominic, Damindu, and all the lovely guys from the restaurant – always with a smile, warm service, and great hospitality.

The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, comfortable, and tastefully designed. The rooftop view is breathtaking, and the overall atmosphere is just perfect.

A heartfelt thank you to the entire team – you made this vacation unforgettable.
We’ll gladly come back – and highly recommend Regal Réseau to anyone looking for a truly high-quality hospitality experience!","Regal Réseau – Where Every Detail Feels Like Home","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d19140639-r1009823890-Regal_Reseau_Hotel_Spa-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"50","191897674","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/70/20/4a/shira-n.jpg","50","0","7","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/751shiran","Shira N","1600C5AA152F5882AD3B9329CCB3FC37",,,,,"751shiran"

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa.

We’re pleased to hear that you felt welcomed and well taken care of by our team. Your kind mention of Himasha, Imesha, and Diluni is truly appreciated — they will be delighted to know their service made a positive impact on your stay.

We’re also grateful for your understanding regarding our breakfast service. To clarify, bottled water is chargeable, as it is a packaged item, but we are always happy to provide regular drinking water free of charge upon request during breakfast or at any of our outlets. Your feedback helps us ensure this information is made clearer for all our guests.

It’s great to know you enjoyed the full breakfast spread and the variety we offer. We look forward to welcoming you back for another comfortable and enjoyable stay.

The hotel's bar offered stunning sea views, and we enjoyed cocktails there in the evening. The staff were friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to assist with some travel inconveniences.

Thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed review of your recent stay with us.
We are truly pleased to hear that you appreciated the high level of service, the stunning rooftop views, and the efforts of our housekeeping team. Your recognition of these aspects means a lot to us.
At the same time, I sincerely apologize for the areas where we fell short of your expectations. Your feedback regarding the condition of the furniture, linens, and the variety of our breakfast offerings is extremely valuable, and we are taking it seriously as we continue to work on improvements. We are also in the process of updating certain areas of the hotel to ensure a more comfortable and modern experience for all our guests.
Regarding the beach, as you mentioned, it is a public area and unfortunately not under our direct control. However, we actively collaborate with local authorities and community initiatives to advocate for cleaner beaches and a better environment for visitors.
We appreciate your honest comments about your overall experience in Negombo, and while we are saddened that the town did not meet your expectations, we are grateful you chose to stay with us to celebrate the New Year.
Thank you once again for your feedback, and we wish you wonderful future travels, wherever they may take you.

Небольшой современный 4х звездочный отель с бассейном на крыше. Потрясающие виды гарантированы.
Номера большие, но мебель очень изношенная, постельное белье и полотенце в основном старые и с пятнами. Но регулярность и качество уборки компенсировали неудобства. 
Отель не имеет своего пляжа и территории, на первой линии у пляжа стоит чей-то дом и если брать номер ниже 2 этажа, то в метре от окон будет его стена и никакого вида на океан. Музыка с крыши доносилась, но позже 11 вечера не играла. Только в новогоднюю ночь было шумно. В остальные дни не мешала.
Ресторан на 5 этаже с великолепным панорамным остеклением. Питание очень однообразное, за 11 дней почти никаких изменений. Но в целом нам хватало. Рыбы и мяса на завтраках почти не было. 
Странно, что везде на отеле размещено 3 звезды.
Самым большим разочарованием стал грязный пляж и океан, без лежаков и душа на пляже. Мало того, что вода мутная, так и мусор был повсюду. Несколько продавцов с китайскими браслетами подходили в первые дни, потом уже узнавали.
В пешей доступности много кафе и магазинов. 
Негомбо вообще не впечатлил. Очень грязный и малолюдный в плане туристов. Отдыхали в январе 2025, встречали новый год. 
Ездили в Хиккадуву, там намного чище и жизнь кипит!
Больше в Негомбо не поедем.","Хороший отель с шикарными видами в грязной деревне","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d19140639-r1001948657-Regal_Reseau_Hotel_Spa-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452391352","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg","1200","2","30","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_E8896OR","Кс Л","F35C9D133BEAEEC884BBA5518CF0777B",,,,,"_E8896OR"

We had a frustrating experience at this establishment, and we strongly advise locals to think twice before booking. Despite making a reservation weeks in advance and paying a 50% deposit, we faced a delayed check-in by over an hour, while foreign guests were accommodated without any issues.

The pool situation was completely unfair—we were told it was at capacity, but foreign guests were freely allowed in. When we agreed to return later in the evening, we found that chlorine had been added early, shutting down access before the official closing time of 8 PM. It was evident they didn’t expect foreigners to swim after sunset and adjusted the rules accordingly.
Another example of discrimination was the pool towel policy—foreign guests had no trouble taking towels to their rooms, but when we did the same, we were denied. Oddly enough, the policy changed overnight after we complained.
When we raised our concerns, instead of taking accountability, the executive chef attempted to pacify us with complimentary items, as if free food would make up for the poor service and discriminatory treatment. Management later offered a 50% refund, which we declined—we weren’t looking for compensation, just fair and equal treatment.
Aside from these issues, room service was slow, responses were delayed, and overall, it was clear that local guests were not given the same priority as foreign visitors. Even the cocktails from the pool bar were disappointing—overpriced and poorly made.
While the rooms were clean and the food was decent, the overall service, treatment, and management approach were unacceptable. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone looking for a fair and welcoming experience.

I would like to address the false statement made by the hotel management and Mr. :Jayashan ""It seems there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the 50% discount, as you mentioned you refused it, but our records indicate you accepted it. Was only charged 50% of the room amount.""

The truth is that Mr. Jayasan and his hotel management team offered us a 50% discount after several issues arose during our stay, which I explicitly rejected. Additionally, before leaving, we had cocktails at the rooftop bar and settled that bill separately. If the hotel claims we accepted the discount, it is a clear example of how locals are treated unfairly by this establishment. The hotel management's public misrepresentation of the facts is deeply concerning and indicates a lack of respect for local guests.","Disappointing Experience – Locals Beware","2025-03","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d19140639-r997983029-Regal_Reseau_Hotel_Spa-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452386535","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg","1200","0","1","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/312supuns","Supun S","9085F102DB5EFB2F839344D10764A986",,,,,"312supuns"

Greetings from Araliya Green City - Nuwara Eliya!
We regret to hear that your check-in experience did not meet your expectations. Our team at Araliya Green City is dedicated to providing professional and respectful service to every guest, and we are truly sorry if you felt otherwise.
Upon your arrival without a prior reservation, our reception team worked swiftly with housekeeping to arrange two rooms for you, despite the hotel being near full occupancy at the time.
With regard to your request to exchange damaged USD notes, we kindly explained that, in accordance with hotel policy and local banking regulations, we are unable to accept or exchange torn or defaced currency. In addition, your request for a 30% discount was respectfully declined, as our rates are fixed during peak occupancy and offered consistently to all guests to maintain fairness.
We understand that these limitations may have caused disappointment, but we assure you that our team, including Mr. Gavindu, did their best to assist you within the hotel’s guidelines. 
However, once your concerns were raised, I personally got involved in the check-in process to ensure your comfort and satisfaction. I am happy to note that by the end of the process, you expressed that you were satisfied with the service received.
We truly value your feedback and appreciate the opportunity to resolve the situation. Should you choose to visit us again, we look forward to welcoming you with the warm hospitality that we are known for.

Warm regards

Safaris provided by the hotel were great - jeeps were comfortable and powerful and ranger tried hard to make it successful.

Ja, es ist hochpreisig - allerdings spiegelt sich der Preis absolut im Aufenthalt wieder - es bleiben keine Wünsche offen!!

Das Hotel hat nach unserer Auffassung 6 Sterne verdient. Neben der Lage, der Organisation inkl. Durchführung der Safaris, den Mahlzeiten sowie dem  exzellentem Service vor Ort  sind auch die Huts überwältigend. Die Gestaltung/Interieure des gesamten Hotels ist sehr durchdacht und imposant! Allerdings möchten wir den Service und die Menschen hervorheben, welche dem Hotel den letzten exzellenten Schliff verleihen!

Wir waren vom 28.12. - 31-12.2024 - im Rahmen einer eigens organisierten Rundreise - vor Ort und haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. Gerne wären wir noch länger geblieben.....aber es gibt so viel Tolles in Sri Lanka zu erleben.

Zudem möchten wir insbesondere sehr positiv die Safaris erwähnen - wir haben jede dieser Möglichkeit genutzt und wir wurden belohnt. Deshalb waren wir ja auch hier - es war einfach grandios .... die Aufzählung an Tiersichtungen würde den Rahmen sprengen ;-) Und ja, Elefanten und Leoparden waren dabei!

Der Service und die Qualität - in vielerlei Belangen - haben wir bisher selten erleben dürfen! Nochmals einen großen Dank an das gesamte Team! Wir können niemanden hervorheben - we were falling in love with all of you!

Wenn Yala, dann werden wir dieses Hotel 100%ig wieder wählen - ja auch für den Preis. Und ja, wir kommen wieder!","Einfach nur empfehlenswert - wir kommen wieder!","2024-12","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g3748686-d8871806-r988789821-Uga_Chena_Huts-Palatupana_Yala_National_Park.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","14","77","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xsonne76","Xsonne76","0817D72E1CD3EF98A7FE66B62E6C0D30",,"2340823","Tappenbeck, Germany","Tappenbeck","Xsonne76"

Arrived to a personal welcome - placing flag of UK on the board to see the International appeal. The room was beautiful and very spacious - one of the 4 new rooms with own pool. 
Golf buggies whisk you from room to reception although it’s fine to walk during the daytime.  
We were assigned a butler who was always on hand and couldn’t do enough for us - the mini bar miniature wines didn’t quite cut it and appreciated the full size bottle exchange!
The chef needs special mention. Incredible food and very grateful to him for the curry cooking lesson. The blackened curries are superb. 
Drinks on the beach were a special treat at sunset (although a wandering elephant prevented this on night 2!) 
Special mention also for grilled lobster dish 
The general manager always attentive and friendly making sure everything just right. 
Rangers are very knowledgeable - ours qualified in S Africa
The safari drive also very well organised in excellent Toyota go anywhere vehicle - leopard eventually seen after much deep jungle road exploring ! The hotel even pays for “fast track” 
Any criticism ? Only one very minor- the all inclusive wine only just acceptable. For an extra £5-£10 a bottle purchase price could improve this as did let down the meal slightly. Think cloudy bay standard to really up the game    
Not a complaint but hope this helps.

I don’t normally write Tripadvisor reviews, having said it’s for a Marriott property because they already have their own comment and review system in their app. What’s more - unlike some Marriott properties where they would chase for Tripadvisor reviews, Marriott Weligama did not do so, so this is simply voluntarily.

This time I think the team really deserves a special mention and extra review so they can be seen. I’m very impressed by how this team, from all angles, have taken this to another level of attentiveness to serve every single guest at the hotel.

Starting from 1 week before check-in, Taneesha from the travel desk has already started contacting me to offer different options for daily activities. Despite several changes and special requirements, she was very professional and tried to cater for everything needed.

During check-in, the desk has spent a long time to explain all my questions, and eventually introduced me to Nishadi, which she would help to answer all my questions tirelessly, from food choices to spa booking, and even after I departed, she still took care of my requests (lost clothing in the room) and made sure I’m well taken care of. Special kudos to Nishadi!

At the restaurant (Wave), although I can’t remember their names, the waiters have been very attentive to our needs. When I was having crab during lunch, having seen I was taking off shells by hand, the waiters offered lime water and wet towels at the moment when I needed the most (and I didn’t even request for it). I’m impressed by their attentiveness.

During checkout, big thanks to Pathium who helped me to sort out my bills when I had some miscommunication with the spa team, as well as payment problems. We ended sorted the issue out, but he has tried his best to help sort out everything needed to make sure I was happy about it, even when it meant he needed to take extra time to sort out the problems despite there’s an easy way out.

For all the other aspects of the hotel, rooms have been amazing (clean, well stocked with water, good amenities, very well maintained), view was great (facing the sea, good vibes), location is not bad (4 minutes next to Weligama train station, city center is nearby).

In conclusion, I think Marriott Weligama’s service is a surprising find, and I don’t see this even in top Marriott properties globally. Having said, the extra care that staff paid and extra steps they have made, have definitely impressed me and I’d very recommend everyone to try out in this hotel when they visit Sri Lanka.","Top class service and facilities, underrated gem in Marriott group","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r992033026-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452389741","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","1200","1","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanK1333","Jonathan K","150A4E62A08172AD9DE4DC7912F200C1",,"294217","Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong","JonathanK1333"

LOCATION: the hotel is centrally located in Weligama with a number of shops and local restaurants within walking distance or a short tuk tuk ride away. There are also 3 beach clubs right next door. The location is certainly an advantage versus a lot of other beach resorts in Sri Lanka which are often quite isolated. Weligama itself is also quite a buzzy little town.

STANDARD ROOM: a spacious entry level room at 46m, albeit it felt a bit dated. It was generally well appointed but I wouldn’t call it particularly luxurious. The best part was definitely the ocean view. We were on the 10th floor (the highest in the resort) and the views were pretty special especially at sunset time. On that note, it is worth checking out the hotel’s rooftop to get the best of the views.

POOL: the hotel has two main swimming pools which are side by side, both similar in design but with respective depths of 90cm and 120cm. There is also a separate water slide feeding into a tiny third pool. It was an ideal setup as quite a compact area which allowed us parents to sit in our loungers, while having eyes on the kids as they rotated between the two pools as well as the water slide. The pools were also heated to a comfortable temperature. The water slide was basic but high speed, and the kids really enjoyed this. The music and saxophone player created a bit of a nice vibe at the pool in the late afternoons.

BEACH: just a few steps away from the pool is the beachfront. It is a public beach hence there are no sun loungers or hotel service once out there, plus there are quite a few scalpers around selling surfing lessons and water sports. The beach itself is pretty decent though – for Sri Lankan standards – with soft sand, a gentle decline and no rocks or other debris. The waves are moderately strong and constant supervision was required for our younger aged kids, but they did love being thrown around in the water.

OTHER FACILITIES: right next to the pools there are a couple of ping pong tables, a foosball table, a pool table plus a sad looking kids club that caters more to babies/toddlers. What was very much of interest to our older kid was the newly opened video games room. This housed a PS5 on a huge projector screen, an arcade style driving game, plus a couple of other things. Note these items were chargeable but not that expensive ($5 for 30 min on the PS5).

FOOD: we had both breakfasts, one buffet lunch and one poolside lunch at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to get free breakfast on a points booking (not the norm). The food was generally decent. There was a wide selection at the buffets, while our poolside lunch was enjoyable.

SERVICE: I have become accustomed to slow, often disorganised service on my trips to Sri Lanka, and was pleasantly surprised to see very efficient service at this resort. Staff here have clearly been well trained. Check-in was very friendly, and we were given a WhatsApp contact number through which any requests were attended to speedily. For example, a local restaurant booking request was sorted within a minute of me asking. Poolside food and drinks service was also above average. The service aspect certainly enhanced our overall experience at the hotel.

PRICES: I haven’t noted specific prices down, but to give an example we spent around 24k rupees (£65) for an entire day at the pool, including lunch for the 4 of us and a couple of cocktails/juices. Within reason I would say.

CONCLUSION: I was very pleased with my stay at the Weligama Marriott. While not the most luxurious of properties, the prime location, nice pool and beach, generally compact layout, beautiful views and excellent service all came together to leave me with a very positive view, and I would certainly consider returning in future. In my view this property is miles ahead of the only other Marriott beach resort in Sri Lanka (the Sheraton Kosgoda).","Dated property, but nice views, well laid out and excellent staff","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r988096021-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"194","59022723","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/84/9d/83/ishan23.jpg","259","537","1344","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londoner2304","Londoner2304","A796AFF776782DACDBD4325641C4BAE2",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","londoner2304"

- our room was spacious and well-designed, comfortable bed, great balcony
- breakfast buffet was really good
- staff were helpful and very pleasant
- both food and service at the New Year’s Eve banquet buffet were outstanding, and a great effort on the room decor and the general organisation. 

Negatives
- everything we got through the hotel was ridiculously expensive: drive to Mirissa (for an outing organised by the hotel) was USD80 round trip, which is extortionate. Same for airport transfer - we were quoted a huge additional cost in USD. Etc. 
- the New Year’s Eve banquet, which should have been a fantastic event, was ruined by the excessively loud music during the meal. Louder does not equal better. You cannot have a convivial meal if the amps - many of which actually touched the tables - are turned up to club night level and your teeth are vibrating with the bass. People could not hear themselves speak, let alone attempt to strike up a conversation with their fellow guests. Little children  were screaming, but their parents could not tell unless they were looking directly at them! We ate (the wonderful food) quickly and left early, as did many others. If the music had gone to club level at 11pm, fine. But not 8pm or 9pm. Such a shame, as the band was really good. The Marriott management needs to take a look at its guests: they are not students attending a rave in a warehouse.","Lovely room, great staff, outstanding breakfast, but some key issues","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g612380-d12553294-r987360147-Weligama_Bay_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html",,"1200","452387615","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg","1200","16","31","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dentifrice","Dentifrice","9D736DA777AB755D8B74635D3014D77D",,"186338","London, United Kingdom","London","Dentifrice"

On site parking available",,,,,,,,,,,,,"From the moment we booked to the day we checked out, 98 Acres Resort & Spa offered an exceptional and seamless hospitality experience that exceeded all expectations.

Reservation Experience:
We took advantage of a special Room Rush offer and booked a Suite Room directly through their website — a fast, intuitive, and convenient process. What truly impressed us was the thoughtful follow-up. A day before our scheduled stay, the hotel sent a personalized reminder email — a first for me with any hotel, and it genuinely saved the day as I had completely forgotten the date!

Getting There:
We drove from Colombo via Beragala–Wellawaya–Ella route, which took about 5 hours. The scenic journey itself was a treat — filled with lush greenery, waterfalls, and mountain views that set the tone for what was to come.

Arrival & Check-In:
We arrived at 2:00 PM and were warmly welcomed by the smiling staff with a traditional blessing and a refreshing iced tea. The check-in process was swift (just 5 minutes), and we were chauffeured to our suite in an eco-friendly electric buggy.

Personal Butler Service:
Our butler, Mr. Haridharan, was exceptional — offering a full room tour, explaining all facilities, dining options, and activities around the resort. His attention to detail made us feel genuinely cared for throughout the stay.

Exclusive Offers:
Upon check-in, we received 15% off at the Ravana Pool Club and 10% off on the nearby Mega Zip Line adventure — an unexpected bonus!

Dining & Culinary Experience:
Dinner was a delight, enjoyed in our room with a golden sunset view of Mini Adam’s Peak and Ella Rock. Their à la carte menu features both Sri Lankan and Western options. Every dish was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and served in generous portions.

The Main Restaurant is just a two-minute walk — spacious, ambient, and operated by highly professional staff. The bar offers a wide selection of beverages including exclusive 98 Acres cocktails. We highly recommend trying their signature drink called “Pickle” — a unique, refreshing cocktail experience.

Unmatched Views & Ambience:
Every villa is strategically designed to face breathtaking views of Ella Rock and Mini Adam’s Peak. Sunrise was absolutely magical. If you’re into stargazing, this is the place — the night sky revealed a million stars, a rare sight for city dwellers.

Facilities & Activities:

The Mini Bar was well-stocked (chargeable)

Gym and spa services are must-try

ATV rides, zip lining, skywalks, abseiling, and more at the Ravana Adventure Zone, just a short hotel shuttle ride away

GoPro and drone video options are available at very reasonable rates (bring your ID or driver’s license)

The Halpe Tea shop on-site offers the finest Ceylon teas to take home

Service & Staff:
The staff — from housekeeping to the executive team — are impeccably trained, respectful, and proactive. Their warm hospitality reflects true Sri Lankan charm and professionalism.

Unique Touches:
As a final gesture, guests are blessed according to their faith before departure — a thoughtful spiritual send-off. We were also gifted a complimentary pack of Halpe tea.

---

Final Verdict:
98 Acres Resort & Spa is not just a hotel — it's an experience. With top-tier service, stunning scenery, mouthwatering cuisine, and well-curated activities, it is undoubtedly one of the best resorts I’ve stayed at in Sri Lanka. Highly recommended for both locals and international travelers.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your recent experience with us. We truly appreciate your kind comments regarding our scenic location, spacious rooms, breakfast spread, and the warmth of our restaurant service team.

We also sincerely regret to learn that certain aspects of your stay did not meet your expectations.

As always, we take our guests’ suggestions seriously, and your comments will be shared with the relevant departments to help us improve. While we regret that this visit did not fully meet your expectations, we truly hope you will consider returning in the future so we may deliver the five-star experience we are known for.

Buggy is unreliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"To start off, the pluses - beautiful property, spacious rooms and well intentioned staff. The rooms overlook the tea estate and has a gorgeous view of the estates and a huge balcony to enjoy it. We stayed in a premium signature room. The food, service staff at restaurant were solid..so was the breakfast.

Now for the not so good - there was a rain shower which knocked down the internet, phone and TV! Which meant, there was no way to connect with the lobby or get help. We were passed from person to person and spent 530-730 pm fixing the issues, which left us all with a headache. Problem was not the issue but the fact that nobody took responsibility to fix it, nor did we get an eta on when it will be fixed. 

Second, there are a lot of fixable issues - no sign boards on property, understaffed which meant no buggy service post 10 pm and before 6:30 am! No public telephones (everything was IP phones). 

The swimming pool is down for renovation and they give access to Ravana pool, but it’s not a place for kids (hikers come to Ravana pool to get drunk and hang in the pool). Also the buggy cannot reach Ravana due to poor roads! So it’s not really a replacement pool. 

So overall, would I recommend? At this price (500 usd a night), not really. At that price and in Sri Lanka, I would expect top notch service that did not happen. The front office manager did his best to assuage with a small discount but that doesn’t cut it for a supposedly 5 star property.","Nice property with more misses than hits!","2025-05","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1008781632-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"1200","452386394","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg","1200","1","31","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karthik104","Karthik104","2ADD099ECE7EF1D8356A44D58716CFE8",,"304556","Chennai (Madras), India","Chennai (Madras)","Karthik104"

Ayubowan!

Thank you so much for your beautiful and detailed review. We are truly honoured to be your favourite hotel in Sri Lanka. It’s wonderful to hear that you enjoyed the magical views, the spacious and clean rooms, and our attentive staff. The location close to Ella and the nine arches bridge really is special, and we’re glad you loved the walk to Little Adam’s Peak with our ranger.

Your kind words mean a lot to us, and we look forward to welcoming you back to 98 Acres Resort and Spa for another perfect stay.

Warm regards,

The restaurant was again beautiful and the staff were extremely polite and attentive. 
The hotel is a short walk from Ella and the nine arches bridge, making it the perfect location for your stay exploring Ella and the surrounding area. One morning we joined the ranger and walked to Little Adam’s Peak, approximately 15/20 mins from the hotel and well worth the early morning wake up call, the views were incredible. If you are looking to stay in Ella, look no further, this hotel is magical and the staff are very special too.

We hired a driver (Randika from SeeLanka Tours) and he came to collect us in Colombo from our hotel, and drove us to 98 Acres in Ella. We even saw a wild elephant on the side of the road, and visited a beautiful waterfall along the way. So even the drive to Ella (which took 5 hours along the southern expressway) was fascinating. 

Once we arrived in Ella, we were so grateful to have chosen 98 Acres. We had a beautiful room that overlooked nature. We even had a peacock come and sit on our verandah on the final morning before we checked out. He was completely at ease, chilling there for at least 2 hours, giving us a chance to carefully take some pics without scaring him off. 

The staff were amazing - absolutely 10/10 in their friendliness and helpfulness. The food was spectacular, and the chef went to such great lengths to ensure we had food that was within our dietary requirements (gluten free for me). And the place is so unique and with such spectacular views over Little Adams Peak and Ella Rock. Every day provided such wonderful opportunities for photographs. 

There were a few minor things I noticed which weren't 5/5: 

1. The glass for the shower doesn't extend to the wall, so every time we used the shower, water splashed over the toilet. 
2. We did hear the noise of the buggies (vehicles which carry guests around the property) from our room, and because we had the top floor of the villa and another couple had the lower floor, there was some noise transfer (we could hear them talking). I ended up using ear plugs the first night, but didn't need them the second night. 
3. We had an Ayurvedic 1 hour massage at the Spa on site, but neither of us were impressed with our therapists. My friend and I are both trained in Ayurvedic massage and we both teach massage. If I visited again, I would find a massage clinic off-site where I can get a proper Ayurvedic massage. The upside was that the view and environs of the Spa on site at 98 Acres was stunning, so we got some great pics for facebook and Instagram.","An amazing place to stay in Ella","2025-05","FRIENDS","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g616035-d2664481-r1007072048-98_Acres_Resort_Spa-Ella_Uva_Province.html",,"205","19820710","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/2e/70/a6/avatar077.jpg","205","116","127","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atlantis88","Atlantis88","CFFD2BAAEFEDE350E9513D018A0B0FAD",,"1636767","Ewingsdale, Australia","Ewingsdale","Atlantis88"

We initially stayed for 2 nights prior to going on our travels. 
ROOMS
We were in the ""Superior Double Rooms"", they are the rooms in the old (original part) of the hotel. We were on the 1st floor, not so good as no view due to all the trees.
Are they old, yes, are they clean, yes, are they comfortable, yes.  The only down side we could see was the patio/balcony in the new building were generally bigger with nice new furniture, as the furniture in the old part is not good, 2 cement seats with a leaking air con unit over your head.
However, as I only sit on the balcony in a morning with a cup of coffee this did not bother me.
All the rooms had a fridge, kettle, tea, coffee,  water etc, hairdryer, and toiletries  in the bathroomnd,  safe in the wardrobe, the rooms were cleaned daily and beds changed.
Wifi in the rooms and around the hotel was excellent.
When we returned after our trip we again stayed in the'Superior Rooms""  (old part) but on the second floor, with much better views.
Second and third floor are the best in the old building, as they have the best views.
We stayed full board. 
The food thought was excellent, fresh  and tasty.
Breakfast and Dinner are both a buffet, Breakfast also had a hot counter for pancakes and omellets.
Dinner evenings were themed with usually a band playing.
Lunch is a fixed menu, a salad, a soup  and a multiple choices for mains and desert. I tried all the choices, they were excellent.
Service in restaurant was hit and miss, sometime a long wait for food or drinks, and sometimes, drinks did not arrive.
OUTSIDE AND POOL AREA 
The hotel has 2 pools, and lots of sun beds, both around the pools and on the grassed area under the Palm trees. BUT not a lot of parasols, which if your fair haired /skin then a real problem.  Lots of sun beds under parasols had towels on them which indicated they wre in use, andcwexwere advised by pool guys we could jot use rmthem, however, they sat empty until around 2.00pm each day, it was clear the pool guys were saving sun beds.  THAT was a problem. However, I was informed the hotel now had 2 new lady managers and changes were beginning to happen, so hopefully the saving of sun beds is on the list of things to he sorted.
Daily the pool guys would come around with iced cucumber for your eyes, cold flannels to cool you off and offer a glasses cleaning service, these little extras are what makes a holiday, and we thought it was wonderful.
OVERALL we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Camelot Beach, and the only negative for me,was the lack of Parasols.
We would definately book to go vack to Camelot, so Camelot Beach, please 🙏 get more Parasols ⛱️","A fabulous hotel","2025-01","COUPLES","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r992280336-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"769","340165190","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/46/82/46/janet-h.jpg","769","13","36","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q228GVjaneth","Janet H","64B191A2143BD32F0D9C58895B39C3E8",,,,,"Q228GVjaneth"

Unser Zimmer war sehr liebevoll  renoviert, aber die Fugen im Bad sehen schon gelblich aus, auch war das Fenster und die Balkontür noch alt, das Glas war trüb und die Klinke wackelte. Wenn die Klimaanlage an war hat es faulig gerochen. Dann gab es massenhaft Mücken im Zimmer , das hatten wir auf unsere Rundreise nirgends, ich vermute, das kommt daher, dass sie die Außenanlage mit Gift benebeln und deshalb suchen die Mücken Zuflucht im Zimmer. 
Wir hatten einen Seitenblick und haben auf das hässliche, dreckige Nebengebäude geschaut. 
Auch die schöne Poolbar sieht innen sehr unsauber und unappetitlich aus. Auch die Eingangshalle könnte moderner gestaltet werden, sieht eher wie ein Hostel aus, mit bisschen Farbe und frischen Blumen könnte man eine gemütliche Atmosphäre schaffen. Die großen Blumenvasen am Boden sind mit unpassenden, viel zu großen Töpfen gefüllt, das sieht alles etwas unbeholfen aus. Draußen an den Pflanzentöpfen blättert die Farbe ab.

Check in was also painfully slow, lots of time spent looking at a computer and you are just left waiting. This is a regular complaint amongst guests but it is still as bad. Staff we found the most helpful were Akash who worked by the pool side, such a lovely polite and efficient man, always smiling and extremely helpful, I hope hotel management appreciate his kindness. Thanks also to Anton, very helpful and eager to please. We will return next year, and hope the hotel will improve on the check in process and restaurant service which was very slow and disappointing.

The resort features three swimming pools, all clean and inviting, though we didn’t get a chance to try the spa. Breakfast was a buffet with an excellent variety of options, catering to diverse tastes. While the rooms were comfortable, they did appear a bit tired and could use some updating.

Special mentions for Nishanthe and Kokilla who served at the bar, always with a smile and great attention.

Anton the room / housekeeping manager who was so attentive in making sure that guests needs are met and ran an amazing team of staff. The pool guys who ensured comfort with sun beds and adequate shade. Even the gardeners go out of their way to say good morning and ask if there is anything you need. 
The staff at this hotel really go out of their way to make sure guest experience is at its best. The General Manager at this hotel never seemed quite as happy as her staff, certainly didn’t smile and charged around finding fault.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your amazing experience at Malu Malu Resort and Spa. We're absolutely delighted to hear that you and your wife enjoyed your stay with us, especially as part of your special wedding anniversary celebration.

We truly appreciate your kind words about our team, and we are thrilled that their efforts made such a positive impact on your visit. We're glad to hear that you appreciated the warm welcome, the cool towels, and the passion fruit sorbet—it’s our little way of helping guests relax after a long journey.

It's wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your room, the beach, the pool, and of course, the food. We’re so happy that you had the opportunity to unwind and enjoy our culinary offerings. Your feedback on the seafood selection and the devilled pork will be shared with our team to ensure we continue improving and providing the best possible experience.

Thank you once again for your recommendation and for recognizing our team's dedication. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Wishing you both many more happy anniversaries to come!

As I did want to have a detour before we checked in to the hotel, we did travel more distance than travelling direct, which lead to us being on the road double the travel time. 

Reached the hotel on March 13, 2025 around 6 in the evening, and was greeted by a person from the hotel staff with a warm and friendly smile and was directed to the front office staff. The staff greeted us, and Chamara the front office manager was the first person to speak to us. He was friendly and was very helpful, in getting our checking in process done in a timely manner. One thing that was great was the cool towels given to freshen up, and the absolutely super passion fruit sorbet which was really a super pick me up for a person who has been on the road for 12 hours, and in hot weather condition. We were welcomed with a garland of flowers, and according to the Tamil traditions. 

The front office managers duties did not end at the point of checking in but he was the person who escorted us to our room, and showed where everything was within the room, so the we do not have to spend time thinking or looking. The room we stayed was super, spacious, and everything was clean and neat. We would also like to thank the hotel team for the lovely decorations done in our room wishing us for our anniversary. 

During our two day stay we had an awesome time, waling on the beach, the dip in the sea to the time spent in the pool, where the water was warm and nice (to be honest I didn’t want to come out of the pool in the evening).

The food at the buffet was super and a good spread of which I did enjoy the roasted pork with pineapple sauce, and the baked tune with garlic butter to name a few (however, whilst the spread of food was great, wish you guys had more seafood). On the second day, we were too full and did not go for the buffe but just ordered two portion of food that would go along with a beer to enjoy. The food which included a Devilled Pork (which was one of the best I have had), and a hot buttered cuttlefish (which I would not recommend as it was batter fried cuttlefish rather than what it is supposed to be). However, this did not mean that we were let down. 

One more great thing was the fact that Chamara the front office manager, and Janaka the F&B manger paid attention to each and every guest, and did speak to them on a daily basis to ensure that he guest were being taken care of, and to attention to any needs. 

A big thank you to both as well as the entire team at the hotel. Will never hesitate to recommend you guys… keep up the good work.","A Stay Worth Every Penny: Pure Bliss from Start to Finish","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g24914478-d2258020-r1001419419-Maalu_Maalu_Resort_Spa_Thema_Collection-Pasikuda_Eastern_Province.html",,"368","209606386","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/7e/56/f2/nharshanahw.jpg","368","17","144","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nharshanahw","Harshana W","DD849D7F23A535E10BEEAD68981A73A9",,"7719299","Maharagama, Sri Lanka","Maharagama","nharshanahw"

Thank you for your valuable feedback following your stay at Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa.

We’re thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our prime location, the stunning views from the restaurant and pool, and the service provided by our dedicated team. We’re also pleased you appreciated the quality of our meals as part of the half-board package.

We do apologize for the initial room placement. As part of our Deluxe category, the rooms on the 1st and 2nd floors offer a more limited view of the sea due to the elevation. Our priority is always to ensure our guests have a satisfying experience, and that's why we immediately moved you to a higher floor room with a better view. We hope this helped to improve your stay.

Your feedback is truly valuable, and we are always looking for ways to enhance our guests' experiences. We look forward to welcoming you back for another enjoyable stay and will be happy to assist with room preferences for future visits.

Warm regards,

We stayed here to recover from a long flight.
Airport stay after long plane journey ”

so the hotel was close to the airport, on the beach. Lovely rooftop pool, with views over the sea.
Comfortable beds. (Although we had two single beds for 3 of us, as they said I didn't inform them we needed an extra bed although i booked 2 adults1 child, so we had to share with our 14 year old son) but the beds were large singles, so this was fine. 
Good breakfast lots of variety. Overall, it's fine for airport stay, but not much to do for longer stay.

We were upgraded to a Junior suite as our balcony with lateral sea views looked straight on to a building site. Fair play they moved us straight away. Only problem, our A/C leaked and flooded a small part of our room one night, towels were not changed one morning and on another when no toilet paper was replenished even though it’s was obvious we ran out. First world problem not an issue. All was rectified very quickly. Issue I had was the very limited Sun beds on rooftop but that’s due to space and there’s no shade at all from the burning sun. The issue being that 2 of the 4 Sun beds that are in the shade were selfishly taken by a couple of women who did not use them at all for well over an hour that we were there. Just their bags and towels. In fact, they went away for 30 mins then came back and sat at the tables to have a very leisurely lunch! I was informed by a member of staff later that they left the area completely after their lunch after I had gone and so never actually used them at all. In all that time no one could use those sunbeds at all… How selfish. Also, another lady had arrived before us had the same issue and tried to reserve the beds but then these 2 ladies arrived and dumped their stuff on the beds. There needs to be a policy here, (if sunbeds are left empty for more than x mins your things will be removed…) which I spoke to their staff about but they couldn’t do anything as they were told by the women not to move their bags etc and totally agreed with what I was saying. Not the staff’s fault but management needs to sort this out. Nearly threw the bag and towels off the rooftop myself! I had my say with the duty reception manager later and hope management reading this will take action for future guests to come or put up more shading. Gripe over.

Once we arrived in the room we had 2 twin beds even through we booked a double, and the baby cot we requested was not in the room. We then had to wait for 1 hours until the new room was ready, which meant our 1 year old baby was super grumpy by the time we finally arrive in the new room to put her to bed.

Once we put the baby to bed my wife went to take a shower and we noticed water coming back from the sink (the sink is actually located outside the bathroom) with a terrible smell, the water was also returning from the drains in the bathroom floor, flooding the entire bathroom. I called the manager to let him know but said it would be impossible for us to leave the room as the baby was sleeping.

The next day at check out I mentioned it again, and the duty manager then removed the bill (for 2 beers) that was in front of me and said she would call her manager. After a super long wait, the manager simply said something to one of the receptionist and left. I then asked the receptionist what was happening and she said they were giving us 50% discount, which I then thanked them for it. Turns out the 50% discount was on the 2 beers we consumed, so it was like a USD5 dollars discount.

At that point I was already late to leave it to the airport and was shocked that this was what they were offering for a major leaked, and flood in the room. I asked them to call the manager again, but she never showed up. Just a disgrace.","Leaking in the room and terrible customer service","2024-12","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297897-d477844-r984439676-Camelot_Beach_Hotel-Negombo_Western_Province.html",,"1200","452360110","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg","1200","6","13","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felipef281","Felipe F","C7ED86237BF6B6F960DB9017344F68D1",,,,,"felipef281"

Most of the staff, especially in the bar were not trained at all. I wanted to sit and order lunch and the waiter proceeded to wipe my table and chair with a dirty beach towel that was sitting in a pile of dirty towels. The waiter couldn’t understand what I ordered so just ended up ordering what he could understand which was rice. I waited 40 minutes for my order and when it came he dropped some of it on the floor. I got up and left. The bedroom on the first floor had mold all over it and in the bathroom. I moved to a different room which was much better. I have stayed here a few times over the years and I’ve never seen it this bad. My stay was completely ruined.

Thank you very much for taking the time to share your detailed experience following your recent stay at Araliya Green City, Nuwara Eliya.

Your comments are invaluable to us, and we will certainly review the room arrangement with our housekeeping and maintenance teams to identify how we can improve the functionality and comfort of the space, especially the placement of the safe.

Araliya Green city was a comfortable hotel. 

Room we were occupying was warm and cozy but a bit cluttered with furniture. Bath cum Toilet was comparatively compact in relation to the space in the room. We found it difficult to freely access the safety locker as it was placed opposite a large closet providing only a narrow space between them. It was inconvenient to open the safe due to lack of space in front. It would be good if this receives attention. May be the issue can be easily solved by moving this piece of furniture containing the safe to a more spacious area within the room providing better operating space.  

The concept of having a food court accessible from the hotel helped us to select what we liked from a variety of cuisine. The garden space adjacent to the food court was very colourful and attractive. 

Heated pool in the enclosed upper most floor was an important amenity which we appreciated but we found the lounge area in the ground floor rather cold to relax. Cold draft was regularly blowing in through the entrance every time the door opened and this area did not have heating.","Centrally located city hotel","2025-03","FAMILY","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608524-d12864938-r1010383889-Araliya_Green_City-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html",,"1200","452386603","https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg","1200","148","10999","www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307kamalp","Kamal P","5E7FD16938FAFD1460C185E4269C950A",,"528934","Byron Bay, Australia","Byron Bay","307kamalp"
